      "Given the shortage of physicians and the ever increasing demand for medical services, many physicians depend heavily on physician assistants (PAs) to provide care within their practice. But PAs across the country are running into a problem: they are the only Medicare-eligible health professionals not paid directly by Medicare for the services they provide.\n",
      "Which is why Alabama-Democrat, 7th District U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell reached across the aisle to Nebraska-Republican, 3rd District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith to propose a solution.\n",
      "Their answer: H.R. 5506: the Physician Assistant Direct Payment Act. The bill would amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for direct payment to physician assistants under the Medicare program for certain services furnished by such physician assistants.\n",
      "“In many communities across the country, including many in my district, medical professional shortages threaten healthcare access and quality. We know that there is tremendous need for more primary care providers in rural areas today and that this need will only grow during the next decade,” explained Sewell. “Our Medicare payment policies must eliminate any barriers that stand in the way of our ability to attract qualified medical talent to rural and underserved areas, including both physician and non-physician providers, such as physician assistants.”\n",
      "Sewell believes H.R. 5506 is a “step forward” in Congress’ overall work to improve access to quality healthcare in rural areas.\n",
      "Smith agrees.\n",
      "“Rural communities, like many in Nebraska’s Third District, continue to lack the variety of healthcare options afforded to other areas of the country,” added Smith. “This narrowly-targeted, bipartisan solution repeals a burdensome regulation which disincentivizes the hiring of physician assistants. At present, Medicare payments to PAs must pass through a third party medical practice, which is an unnecessary and bureaucratic step. This bill will improve access to care in rural communities without impacting the scope of practice, education, or licensing requirements for PAs.”\n",
      "H.R. 5506 has been referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means.\n",

      "“Unlike the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s, when protesters wore their Sunday best and carried themselves with heroic dignity, today’s liberal marches are marked by incoherence and downright lunacy — hats designed to evoke sexual organs, poems that scream in anger yet have no point to make, and an hysterical anti-Americanism.”\n",
      "That quote came from a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Shelby Steele an author and current Stanford University fellow titled “The Exhaustion of American Liberalism: White guilt gave us a mock politics based on the pretense of moral authority.” Steele’s post pulls no punches as he addresses, head on, the fallacy of “white guilt,” and I appreciate that.\n",
      "An acquaintance of mine, Javacia Bowser — a teacher, blogger and all around boss lady  — frequently ask questions of the day (QOTD) to her loyal tribe of fellow writers, bloggers on See Jane Write. On February 13 she queried: Is there a topic you completely avoid writing about? If so, what is it and why?\n",
      "I didn’t answer her question online that day but I haven’t stopped thinking about it. The truth is there is a topic I’ve started and stopped writing about too many times to count  — it’s race and the idea of “white privilege.” The most recent instance included me starting and stopping, writing and revising a blog when Senator Doug Jones named his chief of staff and all the headlines blared that he hired a black man (including calling my own Managing Editor to complain, just to find out she wrote the very same story). Why didn’t they blare that he hired a highly qualified man? Why did leaders within the black community write letters emphasizing that Jones should hire black senior staffers rather than saying that he needed to hire the best and most qualified staff who would work to make Alabama better for everyone? I called friends black and white and even a former colleague I hadn’t talked to in years (a young successful black male who I hired to replace me when I left my job on the Hill) about my strong feelings but at the end of the day I couldn’t get it right. I don’t know that it wasn’t that I wasn’t articulating my  strong thoughts and feelings so much as I could just envision all the ways things could go wrong if it were misinterpreted and I was labeled “racist”.\n",
      "I’ve researched this, whites writing or talking about subjects ranging from the Black Lives Matters movement, to crime and poverty, and of course white privilege. It seems that nearly every time even the most middle of the road approaches add opposing views are met with cries of not getting it because they’re racist and out of touch.  I feel Steele nails the way I feel nearly every time I see someone talk about privilege without addressing actual solutions. I mean tangible action items, as in they plan to put their money where their mouths are in accomplishing what they’re talking about. Here’s what he wrote,\n",
      "\n",
      "White guilt is not angst over injustices suffered by others; it is the terror of being stigmatized with America’s old bigotries—racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia. To be stigmatized as a fellow traveler with any of these bigotries is to be utterly stripped of moral authority and made into a pariah. The terror of this, of having “no name in the street” as the Bible puts it, pressures whites to act guiltily even when they feel no actual guilt. White guilt is a mock guilt, a pretense of real guilt, a shallow etiquette of empathy, pity and regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve said multiple times that the differences between the civil rights movement and many of the liberal movements happening today is huge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest difference is that the former was about peace and equality, and the latter about hate and division.\n",
      "During the civil rights movement leaders were fighting the “us vs. them” mentality; today the leaders of liberal movements emphasis the “us vs. them.” The best those of in the “us” category can do is apologize loudly and often for their/our us-ness whether that be race, wealth, education, backgrounds, beliefs, the list goes on.\n",
      "In the civil rights movement, it was about doing the right thing with clear goals in mind that would move our nation forward. Today’s liberal movement it’s about screaming how conservatives or independents who don’t share their view are evil, wrong and just mean-spirited with no end in sight. If the fight is being led by blacks – you join or agree or you’re racist. If the fight is being led by women – you join or agree or you’re sexist. Don’t believe me, look at how pro-life women were welcomed at the “Women’s March.”\n",
      "Steel closes his post with thoughts I’ve expressed in the past. So long as there’s no real conversations that can be had by progressives and conservatives on race, inequality and poverty without name calling, blame and fear we can’t solve the problems that really matter. No one wins when we can’t talk and there’s so many who want to talk but won’t because of the way the conversation is currently being framed.\n",
      "Today’s liberalism is an anachronism. It has no understanding, really, of what poverty is and how it has to be overcome. It has no grip whatever on what American exceptionalism is and what it means at home and especially abroad. Instead it remains defined by an America of 1965—an America newly opening itself to its sins, an America of genuine goodwill, yet lacking in self-knowledge.\n",
      "This liberalism came into being not as an ideology but as an identity. It offered Americans moral esteem against the specter of American shame. This made for a liberalism devoted to the idea of American shamefulness. Without an ugly America to loathe, there is no automatic esteem to receive. Thus liberalism’s unrelenting current of anti-Americanism.\n",
      "Let’s stipulate that, given our history, this liberalism is understandable. But American liberalism never acknowledged that it was about white esteem rather than minority accomplishment. Four thousand shootings in Chicago last year, and the mayor announces that his will be a sanctuary city. This is moral esteem over reality; the self-congratulation of idealism. Liberalism is exhausted because it has become a corruption.\n",

      "Paul Ryan’s future as House speaker has been such a topic of speculation that even the simple question of whether he will seek re-election to his Wisconsin seat remains secret.\n",
      "Officially, Ryan says he’s still deciding. But a person familiar with Ryan’s thinking told The Associated Press this week the speaker plans to file campaign paperwork and intends to win his seat.\n",
      "To do so, the Republican would have to fend off primary challengers, including one styled after President Donald Trump, and Democrats are fired up about a union ironworker, Randy Bryce, who goes by the Twitter moniker “Iron Stache.”\n",
      "If Ryan emerges victorious, even those closest to him aren’t certain he’ll stay in Congress, particularly if Republicans lose their House majority. Asked whether Ryan would serve in the minority, the person who discussed his re-election plans with AP would not say.\n",
      "The person was not authorized to discuss Ryan’s plans and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n",
      "Ryan’s political spokesman Jeremy Adler said Thursday, “The speaker speaks for himself on this topic, and there is no update to his last public comments.”\n",
      "Washington has been guessing about Ryan’s next step for months, with reports rising to a minor frenzy as allies seek to dispel any notion of a lame-duck speaker, which would be damaging both to fundraising efforts and to governing.\n",
      "Some Republicans speculate that Ryan’s work in Congress is complete now that he’s accomplished his career goal of ushering tax cuts into law. Even if Republicans keep control of the House, it’s doubtful he could achieve much more as speaker, a job he never wanted in the first place, especially with an unreliable partner in Trump. It’s even harder, they say, to envision him as minority leader.\n",
      "Charlie Sykes, an author and longtime ally who had a falling out with Ryan over the GOP’s embrace of Trump, is among those betting the speaker moves on.\n",
      "“I can’t imagine him wanting to stick around too long,” said Sykes, who pinned Ryan’s dilemma on a president who “undermines and distracts” from the GOP’s agenda. “This has been the story of the last two years — him trying to push this policy agenda amid the storm of distractions from the president.”\n",
      "Others expect Ryan still has sizable goals he’d like to accomplish, including downsizing the welfare system and other safety net programs, as he outlined in an impassioned monologue to reporters after the tax bill last year. And as much as Ryan fancies himself a policy wonk who prefers the realm of ideas, he’s actually become increasingly skilled at the art of politics.\n",
      "Unlike his predecessor, Speaker John Boehner, who was forced into early retirement by the House’s rebellious right flank, Ryan has been able to persuade the conservative Freedom Caucus and others from open revolt. If he wants another term as speaker or leader, Ryan may well be able to secure the votes to win it.\n",
      "“He’s an eternal optimist,” said Luke Hilgemann, former head of the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, who now runs GOP campaigns in Wisconsin and other states. “He believes the job isn’t done yet.”\n",
      "And so the debate rolls on. After one report late last year suggesting Ryan’s 2018 campaign would be his last, Trump called the speaker to let him know he would be disappointed if that were true. The speaker assured the president he had no plans to leave, according to those familiar with the call.\n",
      "Just this week, a Republican congressman, Mark Amodei of Nevada, mused openly to home-state reporters of “rumors” the speaker would not only retire from Congress, but that the No. 3 Republican, Rep. Steve Scalise of Lousiana, was on deck to replace him as speaker. It caused a mini-uproar nationally, and overwhelmed the Reno news site.\n",
      "Later, Amodei said he had no regrets about publicly sharing the chatter from Congress. But he also acknowledged he had no firsthand knowledge of Ryan’s thinking.\n",
      "“He’s got to say, ’I want to be the speaker in the 116th Congress,” Amodei told AP, referring to the session after the election. “I haven’t heard, ’I want to be the speaker of the House.”\n",
      "Ryan has allowed questions to linger in part because he keeps his inner circle of confidantes close and doesn’t always fully commit to staying on the job, which he reluctantly took in 2015 after Boehner retired. At the time, the next-in-line Republican, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, withdrew from the race when it appeared he did not have enough support.\n",
      "It’s now a jump ball if McCarthy or Scalise would win the speaker’s job if Ryan were to step aside. Both are popular with House Republicans, but they also have limitations. McCarthy is not seen as conservative enough by some hard-liners and Scalise is still recovering from life-threatening wounds after being shot at congressional baseball practice last year. Neither is openly jockeying to take on Ryan.\n",
      "Ryan has shown few obvious signs of a desire to quit, raising $44 million and visiting 30 states in 2017, much of the money for the House GOP’s campaign committee. The filing deadline in Wisconsin is in June. A Ryan political aide said that talking about the House GOP’s record and ensuring candidates have enough resources to run remain Ryan’s “top priorities.”\n",
      "Asked earlier this year if he would stay on as speaker if Republicans retain the majority, Ryan left room for debate.\n",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday announced the nomination of Alabama Special Deputy Attorney General Corey Maze to serve as a District Judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.\n",
      "“Corey Maze is a very talented and experienced lawyer who would be an outstanding addition to the Northern District Court bench,” said Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall. “He possesses a broad base of legal experience from the prosecution of criminal trials and appeals as an Alabama Assistant Attorney General, to arguing cases before the U.S. Supreme Court as former Alabama Solicitor General, to successfully representing Alabama in the landmark BP oil spill case.”\n",
      "“Maze is a man of the highest integrity and would be a great credit to the U.S. District Court. I wholeheartedly support his nomination,” said Marshall.\n",
      "Maze earned his B.A., summa cum laude, from Auburn University and his J.D., cum laude, from the Georgetown University Law Center. He currently serves as Special Deputy Attorney General for the State of Alabama.\n",
      "Since 2011, he has also served as chief of the Attorney General’s Special Litigation unit acting as the Yellowhammer state’s primary counsel in complex civil matters such as the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the ongoing opioid crisis.\n",
      "From 2008 to 2011, he served as the Solicitor General of Alabama, arguing three cases in the Supreme Court of the United States and winning three “Best Brief Awards” from the National Association of Attorneys General. Before his appointment as Solicitor General, Maze prosecuted criminal trials and appeals for five years as an Assistant Attorney General.\n",

      "President Donald Trump said he opposes any immigration legislation that doesn’t include “a real wall” along the Mexican border and “very strong border security.”\n",
      "Moderate House Republicans are pushing a deal that could lead to citizenship for young “Dreamer” immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally. But Trump told “Fox & Friends” in an interview that aired Thursday that unless a bill “includes a wall, and I mean a wall, a real wall, and unless it includes very strong border security, there’ll be no approvals from me.”\n",
      "Trump said the United States had “the worst immigration laws in the entire world by far” and said he wanted a comprehensive deal that included all of his priorities. “I think it’s time to get the whole package,” he said.\n",
      "Trump’s comments, taped Wednesday, came as immigration talks are underway among House Republicans, with moderates seeking a way for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants to stay permanently in the U.S. But conservatives say they have no interest in awarding what they call “amnesty” to people who came illegally.\n",
      "Moderates trying to force votes on the issue gained their 21st GOP signature Wednesday. With just four more, they should be able to overcome leadership objections and have votes on immigration bills in late June. House leaders plan a pivotal closed-door GOP immigration meeting on June 7.\n",
      "Trump also took issue with the immigration court system, saying other countries have “security people” who “stand there and say you can’t come in” rather than judges who decide immigration claims.\n",
      "“Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? … We’re going to change the system,” Trump said.\n",
      "The administration is dealing with an enormous number of immigration cases along the U.S.-Mexico border, as a sharp increase in deportation arrests under Trump has pushed the backlog above 650,000 cases. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees immigration courts, has sought major changes to the long-clogged courts.\n",
      "The Justice Department recently announced that more prosecutors and judges will be assigned to help whittle away at the caseload. And the administration has also introduced production quotas for immigration judges, raising concern among judges and attorneys that decisions may be unfairly rushed.\n",
