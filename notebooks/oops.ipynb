In the tweet, Trump called those allegations a “total con job.” According to the lawsuit, Trump’s tweet attempted to portray Daniels as a “liar.” Daniels is already seeking a similar defamation judgment\\xa0against Michael Cohen, the president’s longtime personal lawyer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep her from publicly discussing the affair.\\n\\nA sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)! https://t.co/9Is7mHBFda\\n— Donald J.

The suit argues that Trump’s tweet exposed Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, to “hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame.”\\nThe lawsuit adds to an ongoing legal challenge by Daniels that seeks to release her from a legal agreement preventing her from publicly discussing her alleged sexual relationship with Trump. ABC News reports that the Trump campaign has spent $228,000 to pay for some of Cohen’s legal fees,\\xa0an arrangement that could violate campaign finance laws. Earlier this month, the FBI raided Cohen’s\\xa0home, office, and hotel room and seized\\xa0documents, some of which related to Cohen’s $130,000 payment to keep Daniels from speaking out about the affair.\\nThe complaint filed Monday is below.\\n\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Now they have an answer: Neither.\\xa0\\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reached out to both\\xa0Mark Barden and Nicole Hockley earlier this month after\\xa0Rep. Elizabeth Esty\\xa0announced she would not seek reelection. Esty’s decision followed\\xa0reports that she had continued employing her chief of staff after learning of allegations that he had threatened a former staffer’s life.\\nIn the intervening weeks, as they tried to decide whether one of them would seek the seat—as best friends, they agreed only one of them would run—Barden and Hockley met with lawmakers in Connecticut and Washington at the DCCC’s behest.\\xa0They both currently work at\\xa0Sandy Hook Promise,\\xa0a grassroots advocacy organization they launched in the wake of their children’s murders\\xa0that trains educators, students, and parents to identify the signs of potential school\\xa0violence\\xa0and intervene before it occurs. As\\xa0Mother Jones\\xa0reported last week, high-profile Democrats like\\xa0House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Connecticut\\xa0Sen. Chris Murphy, and Esty offered\\xa0encouragement and guidance to\\xa0Barden and Hockley.\\nThe two potential contenders\\xa0announced that neither of them would in fact run on Friday\\xa0through a press release on the Sandy Hook Promise website.\\xa0They say they wish to remain involved with their advocacy work, which they say has has measurable impact since the organization’s founding five years ago:\\n[W]e are not ready to leave Sandy Hook Promise, which we launched as part of [Barden’s son] Daniel and [Hockley’s son] Dylan’s enduring legacy, and has become a national leader in the school safety and gun violence prevention movement. Through Sandy Hook Promise we know what we have built has already saved countless lives, and is still growing and impacting more communities at a remarkable rate. We started this journey together, and right now, we feel we can have more of an impact by seeing just how far we can go together.\\nEarlier this month, when\\xa0Mother Jones\\xa0spoke with Hockley about how she and Barden were weighing the decision, she argued that the political route toward achieving gun control\\xa0might\\xa0prove less effective than the\\xa0tactics Sandy Hook Promise employs, which has successfully brought people from all political backgrounds together\\xa0on the\\xa0subject of school safety. As I recently wrote:\\nThe organization’s success, Hockley says, stems\\xa0in large part from the way it prioritizes education\\xa0and coalition-building over lobbying. The group has trained more than 3.5 million people to prevent school violence\\xa0and is operating in more than 7,000 schools in all 50 states.\\xa0“What we do is teach people about gun violence in a non-polarizing way,” she explains. “If you go in on the policy element only, people take sides too quickly. We go in on that middle ground—you don’t even really have to talk about guns to do that.”\\nIn their announcement Friday,\\xa0they also cite a desire to stay close to their surviving children, who are navigating their high school years. “We know all too well how precious and short time with family can be,” they write.\\nNone of the Connecticut congressional races had been seen as competitive until Esty’s seat abruptly became up for grabs.\\xa0The Cook Political Report changed the race rating from “Solid Democratic” to “Likely Democratic” following reports that the three-term congresswoman\\xa0would not run again. Three Democrats\\xa0and three Republicans\\xa0are currently in the race for the seat.\\xa0\\n',\n",

Trump wrote Monday morning that Mexico “must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S.” and said his administration might not approve a new free trade agreement with Mexico if the country ignores his demands. Like similar tweets from earlier this month, his attacks came shortly after Fox News reported on a “caravan” of Central American migrants traveling north through Mexico.\\n\\nMexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast.\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2018\\n\\nTrump did not specify what he hopes Mexico will do to stop people from coming to the United States, but\\xa0his administration has been pushing Mexico to adopt a “safe third country” agreement that would allow the United States to return Central American asylum seekers to Mexico, despite significant concerns about Mexico’s ability to protect people fleeing persecution. The United States has a similar agreement with Canada.\\xa0Homeland Security\\xa0Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement on Monday that her department\\xa0“encourages persons with asylum or other similar claims to seek protections in the first safe country they enter, including Mexico.” \\nBut if Trump’s aim is to get Mexico to agree to a “safe third country” deal, then he’s long been undermining his own effort.\\xa0Trump’s frequent attacks on\\xa0Mexico have pushed the country\\xa0away from taking in more asylum seekers. Last week, an unnamed Mexican official told Politico that Mexico was open to striking an asylum deal until Trump reportedly “lost his temper” during a February call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. The call and Trump’s refusal to back down from insisting that Mexico will pay for his proposed border wall led Peña Nieto to cancel plans to travel to the United States to meet with Trump, the Washington Post reported in February. \\nMexico’s presidential election officially began in late March, and there seems to be little chance that Peña Nieto, who cannot run for reelection, will hurt his party’s political standing by caving to demands from Trump, who is extremely unpopular in Mexico.\\xa0(Only 5 percent of Mexicans have at least some confidence that Trump will do the right thing on world affairs, according to a 2017 survey\\xa0from the Pew Research Center.)\\xa0One hour after Trump’s tweets, Mexico’s foreign secretary, Luis Videgaray,\\xa0tweeted\\xa0that Mexico determines its own immigration agenda\\xa0and that it would be “unacceptable” to tie the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to unrelated policies.\\nThe advocacy group Human Rights First found last year that Mexico is “far from a ‘safe third country.’” The group reported that people in Mexico who “fear persecution are often deported back to danger” and that Mexican immigration agents “often do not take the steps necessary to allow them to apply for asylum.”\\xa0The number of asylum applications filed in Mexico increased by nearly 700 percent between 2013 and 2016, further straining Mexico’s underfunded asylum agency.\\nThe Trump administration does not appear particularly concerned by those findings. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called for expanding safe third country agreements in October, and Republicans in Congress are backing legislation that would allow immigration authorities to return Central Americans\\xa0asylum seekers to Mexico, regardless of whether Mexico signs a safe third country agreement. But the bill has little chance of becoming law, so Trump’s best option is to negotiate an agreement. Instead of doing that, he is publicly attacking Mexico during an election in which the country’s political leaders are under\\xa0pressure to show they can stand up to Trump.\\xa0\\n',\n",

Trump accused Comey, who has just begun a major promotional tour for his new book,\\xa0A Higher Loyalty, of lying to Congress about his handling of the FBI’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s email server. In the same 8:25 a.m. tweet, Trump also said that Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and “the others” had “committed many crimes.” (Who he meant by “the others” was unclear.)\\n\\nComey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!\\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2018\\n\\nThis was just the latest in a stream of ill-tempered tweets from the president targeting Comey. On Sunday, he\\xa0branded\\xa0Comey a “slimeball,”\\xa0“not smart,” the “WORST” FBI chief in history, and a “self serving” liar. He also threatened Comey with jail time.\\nIn his new book, Comey is equally critical, though far more coherent, on the subject of Trump.\\xa0“This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,” he writes. “His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty.” Comey compares his interactions with Trump to his days prosecuting organized crime leaders: “As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob. The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things.”\\nTrump’s mention on Monday of “Crooked Hillary”—his long-preferred sobriquet for Hillary Clinton—is no doubt a reference to the debate swirling around Comey’s depiction in his book of how he handled the investigation into Clinton’s email server. Trump’s Monday morning tweet suggests that Comey was in cahoots with Clinton and wanted to absolve her of any wrongdoing before the FBI’s investigation was concluded.\\xa0\\nComey, in his own telling, says he likely treated Clinton more harshly because the polls showed that she was likely to win the presidential election. Asked by ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos about his decision to announce that the FBI had restarted its investigation into Clinton’s email server days before the election, Comey said: “I was operating in a world where Hillary Clinton was going to beat Donald Trump. I’m sure that it was a factor. I don’t remember spelling it out, but it had to have been. That she’s going to be elected president, and if I hide this from the American people, she’ll be illegitimate the moment she’s elected, the moment this comes out.”\\n',\n",

Rare move in Trump era. pic.twitter.com/GIsdoQ5bkH\\n— Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) April 13, 2018\\n\\nBefore Pruitt’s ethical troubles came to dominate the conversation around the EPA, discussion of Pruitt’s tenure tended to focus on his steps towards fulfilling President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to “get rid” of the EPA “in almost every form.” Here’s how\\xa0Mother Jones’s Rebecca Leber explained his impact in her\\xa0recent profile of Pruitt.\\nIn just his first year in office, Pruitt has already made stunning strides in that direction. He’s dismantling the Obama administration’s landmark Clean Power Plan, which imposed greenhouse gas limits on fossil-fuel-fired power plants. He has slashed enforcement efforts against polluters and tried to repeal rules meant to safeguard drinking-water supplies. He has threatened to roll back fuel economy standards. He’s moved to weaken new rules for smog, coal ash, and mercury pollution, poorly enforced a new toxic-chemical law, and refused to ban the dangerous pesticide chlorpyrifos. He’s taken aim at dozens of lesser-known rules covering everything from safety requirements for replacing asbestos to emergency response plans in hazardous chemical facilities. In the process, Pruitt has driven away hundreds of experienced EPA staffers and scientists while putting old friends and industry reps in charge of key environmental decisions—a troubling trend that has led former EPA administrators from both parties to warn that he is doing irreversible damage to the agency.\\nRead the rest of Leber’s article here.\\n',\n",

       " {'title': 'After Violent May Day Protests, a Federal Judge Orders an Investigation Into Puerto Rican Police',\n",
       "  'body': '\\n\\nPolice and protesters face off after a May Day march turned violent, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Tuesday, May 1, 2018.Carlos Giusti/AP\\n\\n\\nLooking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA federal judge has ordered an investigation of into how Puerto Rico police responded to\\xa0a May Day demonstration.\\xa0The order, issued Friday morning, calls for “an independent evaluation and assessment” of the violent halting of part of Tuesday’s protest.\\nPolice blocked marchers in the financial district of San Juan, triggering a standoff that was eventually broken when they used tear gas and flash grenades to disperse the crowd. The protest, timed for\\xa0 International Workers’ Day, targeted austerity measures imposed by a congressionally-created oversight board charged with leading the island out of its decade-long fiscal crisis. Puerto Rico’s financial troubles, deepened by the $100 billion in damages caused by hurricanes Irma and María, have forced the government to, among other cost saving measures, close schools, lay off thousands of public employees, and raise university tuition.\\nA earlier federal review found “excessive force and pervasive civil rights and liberties violations” during demonstrations.\\nThe May 1 protests on Ponce de León Avenue, also known as the Golden Mile, in the Hato Rey section of San Juan were planned to pass by the offices of a series of banks and other financial firms. Protesters were blocked from advancing down the street, leading to the standoff and eventual clash.\\n“It was all a setup, it was all planned. They created the situation that led to this conflict,” says William Ramirez, the executive director of the island’s ACLU branch. “It was an ambush that was planned.”\\xa0\\nRamirez told\\xa0Mother Jones\\xa0that police attacked protesters, journalists, and legal observers. The\\xa0New York Times\\xa0reported that 13 people were arrested, and 15 officers were injured by projectiles or “irritated” by gas. The day after the protest, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló accused a small group of protesters of causing the violence by throwing “projectiles” at police, according to the\\xa0Times,\\xa0and lamented that the violence “damages the good name of Puerto Rico.”\\nA spokeswoman for Hector Pesquera, the head of the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, told\\xa0Mother Jones that\\xa0the police “are willing to cooperate as always” with the inquiry. She said that other groups at Tuesday’s protests had negotiated with police, but the particular group that clashed with police had not. “For [two] hours, they threw big rocks, balls with abrasive liquid content and others towards the police,” the spokeswoman said, adding that demonstrators were given a chance to disperse before they cleared the area. “This was a small group and doesn’t represent the majority of the people that were marching.”\\nRamirez said the marchers were only allowed to march as far as a certain point before they were stopped. He says most exit routes were blocked by police, leaving demonstrators essentially trapped. “Hours went by,” Ramirez recalls, without any violence before he says police initiated the clash.\\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\ufeff&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\\nAnother video posted to Facebook shows police converging on a street in the Santa Rita neighborhood in Rio Piedras, home to the University of Puerto Rico and nearly two miles from the original clash. Residents were upset with the police for arresting people on private property.\\xa0\\n\\nA similar protest happened on May Day in 2017. A review of police actions in its wake found their use-of-force reporting and documentation was “grossly inadequate,” and failed to follow guidelines established as part of ongoing court-mandated reforms. The report said the police provided a “deceitful response” when asked to provide video of what happened that day, and accused Pesquera of inserting himself into the chain of command without legal authority. Pesquera has denied the accusation, and has in turn\\xa0accused a federal monitor, Arnaldo Claudio, of improperly interfering with police affairs.\\nThe Puerto Rico Police Department has been operating under a consent decree with the US Department of Justice since 2012 after years of allegations of serious corruption and abuse of the island’s residents. The report analyzing the May 1, 2017, police actions notes that before the consent decree was imposed it was “common knowledge that demonstrations and protests…ended in violent responses by the [Puerto Rico police] against the protesters,” and noted that a federal review had found “excessive force and pervasive civil rights and liberties violations” during past demonstrations.\\n“You have a police department that creates the situation that creates these events, and then uses it to go after people that participate in constitutional protest,” Ramirez says. He says only a handful of people threw objects at police, and has no objection to police arresting such violent demonstrators. “But they cannot use that as an excuse to stop a multitude of people from protesting and, in fact, go after them and hurt them.”\\n',\n",

       " {'title': 'We Obtained Cambridge Analytica’s Post-Election Pitch to Potential Corporate Clients',\n",
       "  'body': '\\n\\nAlex Milan Tracy/Associated Press\\n\\n\\nLooking for news you can trust?Subscribe to our free newsletters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the wake of Donald Trump’s shock victory in 2016, Cambridge Analytica, the secretive data analytics firm that worked for the Trump campaign and is now ensnared in an international controversy, set out to capitalize on its connection to the new president-elect. The company, partly owned by conservative hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer, churned out press releases touting its “integral” role in Trump’s win. Its employees took a victory lap on TV. And most importantly, Cambridge looked to bring in new business by pitching itself as the cutting-edge technology firm that put Trump in the White House.\\nMother Jones has obtained internal marketing materials and pitch presentations that reveal new details about Cambridge’s post-election blitz. As we’ve previously reported, the biggest criticism of Cambridge in US political circles is that the company habitually overpromised and underdelivered on its pledges to bring a psychographic approach to how campaigns talk to voters—that is, using psychological research and personal data on millions of individuals to better target and persuade them. The firm’s marketing materials suggest that, outside of politics, Cambridge was also misleading in its pitches to potential corporate clients.\\nIn one Cambridge presentation, entitled “Data-driven behavior change,” the firm outlines its use of “behavioral communications”—tailoring a message to a voter or a consumer based on his or her personality, such as whether the intended recipient is neurotic or conscientious, outgoing or introverted, a leader or a follower.\\xa0That presentation uses advertisements for Ford, American Express, and Coca-Cola to illustrate how an ad for a product could vary depending on the personality profile of the intended audience.\\nHere, for example, is an ad for American Express:\\n\\nHere’s one for Ford:\\n\\nHere’s one for Coca-Cola:\\n\\nCambridge Analytica has never worked for American Express. Or Ford. Or Coca-Cola.\\nA spokeswoman for American Express says it had no record of Cambridge working for or pitching the company. (It was possible, the spokeswoman added, that Cambridge pitched an agency that works with American Express, but she could find no record of that.) In fact, when American Express learned in early 2017 that Cambridge had used the company’s name in promotional material on its website, the company asked Cambridge to remove any mention of American Express.\\n“When a vendor shows us their marketing materials with sample work for big brand names, the expectation is that those examples are projects they have actually worked on—not theoretical work.”\\nIn Coca-Cola’s case, a spokeswoman says that Cambridge had pitched work to its Western Europe and North America business units in 2016 and 2017, but “we did not engage and have never worked with them.” A Ford spokeswoman confirms Cambridge never worked for Ford but did not reply to a follow-up question about whether Cambridge had ever pitched the auto company.\\nPolitical consultants who work with Democratic and Republican clients say that Cambridge’s use of Ford, AmEx, and Coca-Cola in its pitch materials was highly suggestive, if not misleading. “The implication and the inferences are that they did this work,” says Bill Wilson, president of the Market Research Foundation, a conservative data analytics organization.\\nAnother prominent Republican consultant says, “We would never do that unless we were specifically calling out someone’s creative for being so good/consistent with what we were pitching a vision for.” This consultant—who has attended one of Cambridge’s pitches—notes it is hard to imagine Cambridge singling out another firm for praise in one of its presentations.\\nA Democratic digital advertising strategist echoes that sentiment. “When a vendor shows us their marketing materials with sample work for big brand names,” the strategist says, “the expectation is that those examples are projects they have actually worked on—not theoretical work.”\\nA spokesman for Cambridge Analytica says in a statement, “These were illustrations or mock-ups of how the Cambridge Analytica approach could potentially work for brands, and were used in pitch meetings to help visualize our services. We do not claim that we have worked for these particular brands and we always make it very clear that these are not case studies. Any suggestion that Cambridge Analytica has claimed to work for these brands is false.”\\nCambridge Analytica does not disclose its commercial clients. BuzzFeed recently reported that the Economist magazine and the Financial Times\\xa0had hired Cambridge to gain more US subscribers. (The website for Cambridge’s commercial arm\\xa0lists case studies for two unnamed media clients, a “global periodical publisher” and a “newspaper.”) Earlier news stories reported that Cambridge had also pitched MasterCard and the New York Yankees.\\nThe firm’s website also says that it was a recent recipient of a David Ogilvy Award given by the Advertising Research Foundation. The foundation’s chief executive told the New York Times\\xa0this week that he was looking into the allegations that Cambridge had misappropriated personal Facebook data and was considering rescinding his group’s award to Cambridge.\\n',\n",

On Thursday, the social media behemoth announced a partnership with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)\\xa0to help provide “real-time insights…on emerging threats and disinformation campaigns from around the world.”\\n“This will help increase the number of ‘eyes and ears’ we have working to spot potential abuse on our service,” Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global politics and government outreach director, wrote in a statement posted to the company’s website, “enabling us to more effectively identify gaps in our systems, preempt obstacles, and ensure that Facebook plays a positive role during elections all around the world.”\\n“The research community is, for good reason, highly skeptical.”\\nThe DFRLab is a division of the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based international affairs think tank.\\xa0The lab documents disinformation efforts around the world—including\\xa0Syria, Europe, and the US—as they happen. It was on the leading edge of exposing the American alt-right’s disinformation efforts ahead of the French presidential elections in 2017. Its researchers also documented doctored photos designed to sway 2017 parliamentary elections in Germany, and\\xa0Twitter botnet activity ahead of elections in Italy in March.\\nPast DFRLab investigations have focused on disinformation spread on Facebook. The lab’s host, the Atlantic Council, is\\xa0funded by various donors that include large international and domestic corporations, foreign governments, government agencies, foundations, and individuals. The organization’s\\xa0donor policy\\xa0“stipulates that the Atlantic Council is accepting such contribution on the condition that the Atlantic Council retains intellectual independence.” Still,\\xa0the sheer size, reach, and makeup of its donors has\\xa0drawn criticism, with some worrying that the money from foreign governments and corporations inevitably influences the final research product.\\xa0\\nThe partnership is just the latest effort Facebook has announced to better police its platform for electoral disinformation. In April, the day before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sat for two days of Congressional questioning, the company announced\\xa0it was partnering with several big-name foundations to form a commission to “provide independent, credible research about the role of social media in elections.” This commission will facilitate scholarship and research with the help of “privacy-protected datasets from Facebook,” which the company has promised not to review prior to publication. Facebook has also partnered with dozens of news organizations, civil society groups, and governmental organizations in Mexico to fight the spread of “fake news” ahead of that country’s July 1 election in a project called “Verificado 2018.”\\nThe company has worked to burnish its image via a large television advertising campaign\\xa0that laments the platform’s\\xa0promotion of “fake news and data misuse” and promises to do better. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has so far rebuffed calls from British lawmakers to\\xa0come and answer questions. Facebook has also tightened public access to data across its platforms (it also owns Instagram and WhatsApp) through its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the process by which third parties, including researchers, get data from the company for review. That prompted at least 20 academics from around the world to write Facebook an open letter\\xa0demanding more access for research.\\n“Facebook is under immense pressure from lawmakers and civil society organizations to stop enabling malicious actors through willful negligence,”\\xa0Miranda Bogen, a policy analyst at Upturn, a nonprofit research organization that examines technology and public policy, tells\\xa0Mother Jones. “While the election interference, predatory advertising, human rights abuses and rampant harassment that has spread across the platform in recent years doesn’t seem to have made a dent in the company’s profits, the platform is skating on thin ice with regulators and the public.”\\nBogen recently co-authored a paper arguing that Facebook has made progress on offering users transparency about advertising on the site, but has not gone far enough. She says Facebook is “right to recognize that it won’t be able to spot emerging threats alone, but the specific terms of this partnership and the company’s other research initiatives are far from clear.”\\nBogen suggests the public would benefit from additional ways to independently monitor Facebook’s behavior.\\xa0“Think tanks have taken heat,” she says, “for close association with companies that have an interest in the policy matters those organizations study,” adding that some\\xa0might question whether organizations like the DFRLab “who rely on a friendly relationship with Facebook will find it difficult to stay neutral” when publishing\\xa0conclusions that might threaten their access.\\xa0\\nGraham Brookie, the managing editor and acting director of the DFRLab, told Mother Jones that he is well aware of\\xa0Facebook’s record and\\xa0its critics.\\xa0But he sees a role for the DFRLab, and it’s mission to document and expose disinformation, to play inside of Facebook. “The whole point of it is that if we’re going to be more connected than at any point in human history then we need to be more resilient” to disinformation efforts, he says.\\nAccording to a\\xa0blog post\\xa0Brookie wrote on Thursday, the partnership will allow the lab to “focus more closely on the challenge of defending democratic debate in elections around the world.” He wrote that the lab’s researchers will still “cast an independent and critical eye on all platforms, including Facebook itself,” stressing it will not be monitoring elections\\xa0for\\xa0Facebook, but rather monitoring election disinformation activity across all online platforms.\\n“The research community is, for good reason, highly skeptical,” he tells\\xa0Mother Jones,\\xa0adding that that’s what he’d expect.\\xa0“We’re looking forward to seeing what we can do and hopefully we can have an impact.”\\n',\n",
