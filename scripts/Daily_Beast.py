  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In a remarkable appearance Wednesday, Rudy Giuliani said Donald Trump had indeed repaid the money used to buy Stormy Daniels’ silence about their affair, and that Trump had indeed fired then-FBI Director James Comey because Comey wouldn’t tell Trump that he wasn’t under investigation. Both statements contradict the story the president himself and his White House have previously offered. Giuliani’s appearance with Sean Hannity—one of the first by the former U.S. attorney since he joined Trump’s rapidly assembled new legal team, which has promised a tougher response to special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe—left the Fox News host and frequent Trump adviser and enabler openly stunned.In an appearance stuffed with odd factual errors, like saying no president had ever before been subpoenaed, and sweeping claims about “criminal” Hillary Clinton and “disgraceful liar” and “very perverted man” James Comey, Giuliani flat out said Trump had paid back the money shelled out to buy the porn star’s silence, and that there was no problem there. That claim—contradicting the insistence of Trump’s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen that he paid the money himself after taking out a home loan—marked the first time a member of Team Trump admitted the president had paid money to Cohen for the nondisclosure agreement with Daniels, which was inked days before the 2016 election. About Trump “paying some Stormy Daniels woman one hundred and thirty thousand,” Giuliani declared that “is going to turn out to be perfectly legal. That money was not campaign money. Sorry I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know. It’s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation.”An incredulous Hannity—outed in a federal courthouse last week as one of Cohen’s clients—interrupted: “They funneled it through the law firm?”Giuliani barreled on: “Funneled through the law firm, and then the president repaid it.”Said Hannity: “Oh. I didn’t know. He did?”The apparent admission came less than a month after Trump categorically denied knowing about Daniels’ pay-off, and a week after he admitted that Cohen had represented him in negotiating her nondisclosure agreement. Near the end of his hour-long appearance, Giuliani called the federal agents who raided Cohen’s Manhattan office last month “stormtroopers.” Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District, repeatedly boasted on Fox during the 2016 presidential campaign about information on the Hillary Clinton investigation he said came from active FBI agents—a leak that’s expected to be addressed in a forthcoming report by the Justice Department’s inspector general.

I don’t remember it clearly either.”"},
 {'title': 'The 7 Traits of a Great Nat Sec Adviser (Bolton Has 0)',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Just a few days ago, Brent Scowcroft celebrated his 93d birthday. He is not in the best of health. His days on the public stage are behind him.But for those who study American power and leadership in the modern era, the slender, quiet former Air Force lieutenant general remains a giant. He established the standard by which all will be measured who hold the office of national security adviser to which John Bolton was just named. And understanding the reasons for Scowcroft’s success is the key to understanding why Bolton is such a disturbing, devastatingly bad choice for the job.Scowcroft is the only person to have served as national security adviser twice—once under President Gerald Ford and once under President George H.W. Bush. Innumerable factors led to his success in the job. But of these a few stand out. They were his world view, his temperament, his respect for process and systems, his respect for his colleagues and the regard in which they held him, his management skills, and his relationship with the presidents he served. In each of these vital characteristics, not only does Bolton fall short, he does so spectacularly. Indeed, you might well say that if Scowcroft is the gold standard among national security advisers, then Bolton is fool’s gold.World view may seem a vague term. But one of the unifying characteristics I have noted about all those who have distinguished themselves among America’s foreign and national-security policy leaders is that they carefully cultivated their view of the planet every single day of their lives. Men like Scowcroft, Kissinger, Brzezinski, and Shultz would wake up and study the news and recalibrate their sense of the planet, shifting power, and America’s role and interests. Perhaps Bolton does that. But world view is more than that. For the past 75 years, America’s leaders have sought to create an international system of institutions and laws that would reduce the risk of conflict, protect public goods and spread core ideas like democracy, human rights, and free markets. Those leaders have seen it as essential that America invest in the development of that system—because it was in our national interest to do so, because it made the world safer and more prosperous and benefited every American citizen as a consequence.“Bolton seems likely to exacerbate Trump’s worst impulses while failing to offer him the counsel he desperately needs.”Donald Trump is overseeing a dramatic shift away from that ideal. He is promoting a nationalist view without precedent since the end of the Second World War. He is undercutting international institutions, withdrawing from treaties, undermining alliances, and acting unilaterally in a way that is without modern precedent. And he has hired Bolton precisely because he shares the same views. Bolton has shown contempt for the international system since before he became U.S. U.N. Ambassador under George W. Bush in 2005. It is one reason 100 former diplomats opposed his nomination to that job and that a Republican-controlled Senate would not confirm him (he became a recess appointment). His belief in the most extreme, distorted view of American exceptionalism not only raises the risk of war in places where he advocates pre-emptive intervention like Iran or North Korea, it is also a threat to the entire international system that men like Scowcroft worked hard to shape and strengthen.Scowcroft’s temperament was famously even-keeled. He did not seek the spotlight. He worked behind the scenes but never let his ego get in the way. This enabled him to maintain good relations with other colleagues and to provide quiet counsel to the president. Bolton is a bomb-thrower, combative, historically nasty to his subordinates. He also has a taste for the spotlight (coming as he does in the wave of cable-television personalities hired into this administration.) Worse, his confrontational, hot-headed persona is likely to exacerbate the worst traits of his boss, the president.Scowcroft was famously disciplined, waking very early each morning to work out before heading to the office, demanding adherence to a strict policy process that ensured all views would be heard, carefully considered and then framed thoughtfully before being presented to the president. Bolton has a reputation as a loner who does not play well with others. He is an effective bureaucratic in-fighter and has a record of advancing his views. While these are useful traits, they are not most important in a job that has among its key roles and responsibilities serving as an honest broker among other actors and agencies.Because Scowcroft was seen as respectful of the process and his colleagues, he was trusted to represent their views fairly to the president. To say that Bolton was not similarly trusted by his colleagues in the State Department when he was at the U.N. is an understatement.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Because Scowcroft saw his job as managing a process rather than advancing his own views or profile, he was able to work across agencies harvesting the best support for White House decisions and, importantly, ensuring effective implementation of those decisions. Bolton’s contrary impulses in these areas will make it harder for him to effectively develop or implement policy.The biggest problem with Bolton however, is not Bolton. It is Trump. national security advisers are just as powerful as the president lets them be. If the president respects process, seeks good advice, demands his adviser presents him with real choices, empowers that adviser by requiring all work through a process, success like Scowcroft’s is possible. Scowcroft also achieved it because he and, for example, George H.W. Bush were very close friends who had a deep bond of trust and mutual respect. But Trump has shown utter disregard for process and for outside advice. He is profoundly undisciplined and influenced more by television, family and friends than his Cabinet. What’s even worse is that he does not want Bolton to provide advice. He seemingly wants him to validate, promote, and defend Trump’s decisions. In keeping with Trump’s Fox News centric view of the world, he sees advisers only to the degree they appear on the news and weighs their performance by the degree to which they make him look good. Thus, even were Bolton suited to the job to which he has just been appointed, he would fail because of his boss. But alarmingly, Bolton seems likely to exacerbate Trump’s worst impulses while failing to offer him the counsel he desperately needs. In other jobs, this could mean policy misfires or inaction of limited consequence. But when it comes to the job of national security adviser the stakes are much higher. The selection of Bolton and Trump’s predispositions now make war and the undermining of much of what America has sought to build for three generations ever more likely."},
 {'title': 'White House Lawyer Crashes FBI Meeting on Trump-Russia Investigation',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Two highly classified meetings about the Trump-Russia investigation held Thursday had a surprise participant: one of President Donald Trump’s lawyers. And he got an earful for it.Emmet Flood, the new lawyer for the White House overseeing its response to the Mueller probe, headed into the Justice Department with White House Chief of Staff John Kelly late Thursday morning and departed with him when the meeting was over. Flood also accompanied Kelly in and out of a second meeting held on Capitol Hill. The first meeting included Rep. Trey Gowdy, Speaker Paul Ryan, Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Devin Nunes, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Rod Rosenstein, and Chris Wray, as well as brief appearances from Kelly and Flood. The second included the Congressional “Gang of Eight,” the leaders of both parties from both chambers, as well as the heads of the intelligence committees. Flood and Kelly left soon after appearing in the Capitol Hill meeting. More than one participant in that meeting told Flood his appearance was inappropriate, according to a Congressional official familiar with the meeting. The White House downplayed Flood’s role in the meeting. In a statement, the White House press office said Flood and Kelly only went to the meetings to “facilitate” them. “Neither Chief Kelly nor Mr. Flood actually attended the meetings but did make brief remarks before the meetings started to relay the President’s desire for as much openness as possible under the law,” the statement said. “They also conveyed the President’s understanding of the need to protect human intelligence services and the importance of communication between the branches of government.” But Flood’s presence fueled the perception that the White House was trying to monitor the investigation into the Trump campaign. And Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal lawyers, helped. “We want to see how the briefing went to today and how much we learned from it,” he told Politico, referring to how he’s deciding whether or not Trump will sit for an interview with Mueller. “If we learned a good deal from it, it will shorten that whole process considerably.” Carrie Cordero, formerly an attorney in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said Flood’s attendance created the appearance of impropriety. “It creates the appearance that the briefing was set up for the purpose of the defense team learning what was going on in the investigation,” she told The Daily Beast. “That’s the optics of it. Whether or not that is really what’s happening, we don’t exactly know. But I can’t think of any positive reason for him having been there.”The meeting focused on reports that the FBI used a confidential informant to gather information about the Trump campaign, which Trump claims was the FBI spying on his campaign.Cordero said the meeting appeared designed to quell Trump’s concerns.

But I haven’t seen anything revealed that gives any credence to the allegation that the FBI did anything inappropriate by using this confidential source.”Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, attended both meetings and said he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI. “Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign,” he told reporters after the second meeting. Schiff said in a statement released later that he told Flood his appearance at the meeting was “completely inappropriate.” Mark Warner, the Senate intelligence committee’s top Democrat, echoed Schiff.“For the record, the President’s Chief of Staff and his attorney in an ongoing criminal investigation into the President’s campaign have no business showing up to a classified intelligence briefing,” he said on Twitter."},
 {'title': 'The Republicans Are Clinging Frantically to Power',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Republican Party is building a wall. Not the one Donald Trump promised his supporters Mexico would pay for (and then American taxpayers would pay and now, apparently, the U.S. military). The GOP is desperately seeking to build a wall around its power, fearing its imminent erosion as a host of forces—demographic, cultural, and political—come barreling its way.Last week’s historic March for Our Lives was a watershed moment. For more than four hours on a Saturday afternoon, the nation’s gaze was fixed on a group of teenaged heroes and heroines, led by the iconic girl from Parkland, Florida: 18-year-old, Cuban-American, bisexual, head-shaven and powerful Emma Gonzales, who literally stunned a nation with 6 minutes and 20 seconds of remembrance and tear-stained silence. The Parkland students are becoming household names. Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Delaney Tarr, Ryan Deitsch, Jaclyn Corin, Sarah Chadwick, Aalayah Eastmond and their classmates have entered the public consciousness in incredibly personal ways. They have shown great skill in snatching wigs, careers, and advertisers when attacked. And as they have fearlessly swept aside the tired American stasis on gun reform they have brought with them an army of fellow young activists from around the country: Zion Kelly, who spoke so movingly of losing his twin brother Zaire to gun violence right there in the nation’s capital; Naomi Wadler, the tiny girl with the fierce, curly mane who spoke for women of color whose tragedies rarely make the front pages, and Yolanda Renee King, the 9-year-old sole grandchild of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who spoke of her dream of a gun-free world and proved that there is still magic and charisma in that epic surname. By taking the power of their suffering, and frankly of their young, affluent, articulate whiteness, and metastasizing it to youth of color from urban centers and to the oldest of the Sandy Hook kids, some now in high school and three of whom spoke at the rally, and to Black Lives Matter (who amazingly, are now their elders), the Parkland kids are doing what white college students in the 1960s did for SNCC when they answered Bob Moses’ call and forced the media and the world to refocus its attention on civil rights by getting on those buses to face firebombing and murder with black students and local activists; and what white ministers did when they answered Dr. King and John Lewis’ call to face the dogs and batons of white sheriffs alongside black marchers on the Edmund Pettus bridge. In so doing, these young activists are shaking the foundations of America’s gun culture, sending the right wing into a full-fledged panic, and bringing the NRA to its knees. The day after millions of Americans, mostly young but also middle aged and old marched against gun violence, Remington, the company that manufactures the AR-15 death machine preferred by mass shooters, filed for bankruptcy, fleeing to the rescue of banks, many of whom are too shamefaced to publicly comment on their association with the gun-maker. In its bankruptcy filing, which was delayed by the Parkland massacre, Remington cited not just the glut of gun inventory it built up in anticipation of another Democrat in the White House to drive sales, but also a lawsuit by Sandy Hook parents that threatens to shatter the protective shield against litigation that federal law provides to gun makers alone.To try and stem the accelerating tide toward gun reform, the NRA and its media apparatchiks have deployed gutter tactics, smearing the Parkland teens, trying to bully them and lying about them, and when that doesn’t work, whining that they are somehow “not allowed” to criticize them. It’s an admission of weakness that the kids can see, and that is prompting them to drive the stake in deeper. Republicans are also desperate to stem another tide that was visible in the patina of last Saturday’s march. The multiracial future isn’t coming, it’s here. Millennials and post-millennials are the most diverse demographics in American history. Together, they number more than 95 million people (depending on how you count them, versus the 76 million baby boomers who were born, not all of whom still live, and the 55 million births for my generation, Generation X. These younger cohorts, in large part because they are chock full of people of color, are far more liberal than their parents or grandparents’ generation; more accepting of LGBT rights, less interested in where trans people go to the bathroom, more attuned to the realities of white privilege, police brutality and economic inequality, frankly, more moral and less relativistic, and now, thanks to Parkland, more determined than ever to vote out the politicians who serve corporate masters rather than the popular will. Republicans ignore teenage voters and pre-voters at their peril. If they don’t get you in 2018, wait till 2020. In response, some Republicans are throwing out democracy itself in an all-out bid to cling to power. Pennsylvania Republicans are seeking to impeach the state supreme court justices who ruled their partisan gerrymandering illegal. In Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker had refused to hold special elections that his party fears will go Democrats’ way and even backed legislation to overrule a court order to do so before finally backing down this week. In Alabama, after Doug Jones won a surprise U.S. Senate election, the Republican-controlled legislature decreed an end to special elections at all. Other Republicans, led by the president of the United States, are seeking the South African solution to their coming super-minority status. Having already tried to use a phony electoral integrity commission to delete the votes of millions of non-white Americans, the Trump administration announced this week that it will seek to game the Census by adding a citizenship question, with the clear goal of producing an undercount in states with heavy immigrant populations, and disproportionate power for states that are mostly rural and white. Republicans attempted to produce a cover story, first by lying, with the White House spokeswoman claiming the Census has included a citizenship question in all but one year, when in fact it hasn’t included such a question on the main survey since 1950. And then, even more outrageously, they sought to cloak themselves in the mantle of protecting the Voting Rights Act, which their Supreme Court majority and their governors and secretaries of state have been busy gutting since the Obama era, and which Jeff Sessions, the apparent architect of the Census gambit who Coretta King warned off the federal bench for his hatred of voting rights, is leading his Justice Department to fight against in court. Already at least a dozen states, led by New York and California, have announced their attention to sue.Republicans from the president on down are attacking sanctuary cities, with some California sheriffs making inmate release information public to try and help ICE snatch undocumented people in contravention to the state’s sanctuary law. Already, ICE has become Trump’s mass deportation force, scouring the country for errant, brown math teachers, baseball dads, soldiers, and grandmothers to drive out of the country. Prime targets include immigration activists, and any undocumented person who dares show their face at a public protest.All over America, you can almost feel the sense of panic. The Republican Party, which now almost exclusively represents a handful of uber-wealthy, ideologically extreme donors like the Mercers, the Kochs, the Adelsons and the Bradley Foundation plus conservative white Christian men and about half of white women, is fighting to maintain control of a country that will soon be majority non-white, that is already majority urban, and that is increasingly secular. Rather than seek an accommodation with the future, they are laying the groundwork for minority rule. Their aim has become so blatant, their mouthpieces like Fox News host Tucker Carlson are outright admitting that they cannot abide any changes to the racial and cultural uniformity of their neighborhoods, which sounds a lot like a genteel version of the anti-“block-busting” picketers of the 1950s and ’60s.

The Republican tax cut rammed through by Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell blatantly seized a trillion dollars from the treasury and handed it over to the wealthiest Americans and to corporations. The resulting deficits are being used as the excuse to push for a balanced budget amendment that would decimate spending on the working class and on the poor, who many in the GOP base perceive as almost solely black, brown and immigrant. Meanwhile the Trump administration, having handed China global leadership on trade (and diplomacy with North Korea) while potentially devastating its own core states with chest-puffing tariffs that only hurt American workers, is quietly seeking to get back into the TPP. As if China or anyone else would bother letting us back in.With Trump in office, Republican religious leaders are living openly as power and wealth-grabbing Pharisees, pretending not to notice the porn stars and Playboy bunnies littering their heaven-sent president’s mentions. Do their sermons explain how exactly married-for-the-third-time Trump getting spanked with a magazine cover of him and his children makes him the modern day Paul?And the right’s greatest villains, from defeated apparent serial pedophile Roy Moore to criminal ex-sheriff Joe Arpaio to coal magnate Don Blankenship, who went to prison for overseeing the deaths of his own miners due to a wanton refusal to safeguard their lives over his profits, are boldly seeking direct rule over their credulous victims through election to the United States Senate. If the Obama economy wasn’t so sound, there might be a full-on popular vote.Against the increasingly authoritarian and morally shallow backdrop of Trumpism, the Republican Party is scrambling to find ways to stifle the democratic process before November, spewing at its cultural opponents and rushing to erect an American feudalism that locks in the plutocratic status quo. They are building a wall around the roughly 4 in 10 voters who endorse this funhouse mirror version of America. It’s a wall that could wind up closing them in. "},
 {'title': 'The Top Trump Donor Who Helps Promote Chairman Mao',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As the Republican Party heads into one of the more difficult electoral climates in recent memory, it is leaning heavily on the financial help of a mysterious donor who is, among other things, tied to a nonprofit group that hails the greatness of infamous communist dictator, Mao Zedong.Sherry Li is not your prototypical GOP funder. She only started giving recently, and it’s not entirely clear what professional or ideological axe she has to grind. The main project with which she is associated—a Chinese-themed amusement park in upstate New York—is not the typical resume line for a well-heeled party supporter. But since last year, Li has contributed more than $400,000 to Republican candidates and party organs. She’s donated to the RNC directly, and to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and the National Republican Congressional Committee. The $270,500 donation she has made to a joint fundraising account for President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee, makes Li the third-largest contributor to the Trump Victory Committee during the current election cycle. One of her business associates, Lianbo Wang, is the second-largest, having contributed $329,500. All the money has won Li access to a number of exclusive events for GOP donors, including events in New York hosted by Graham and Rep. Steve Stivers, the chairman of the NRCC and another recipient of her campaign contributions. But despite all the checks written and doors opened, Li seems to be a mystery in Republican politics, including to those in her home state. “Don’t know her,” former governor and 2016 GOP presidential candidate George Pataki remarked succinctly. The RNC and NRCC did not respond to questions about her contributions. One of the party’s top fundraisers was blunt in his take on Li and her business partner, telling The Daily Beast, “I have never heard of them.”Where Li got the money to make the sizeable contributions is only slightly less mysterious than Li herself. She has given before, but in far smaller amounts: $2,500 in 2012 to Sen. David Vitter’s (R-LA) Senate campaign and $2,000 in 2013 to Rep. Bob Goodlatte’s (R-VA) re-election. In 2014, she gave $55,000 to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. And in 2015, she started giving big—$32,300 to the RNC and $35,000 to Trump Victory.She is currently planning a sprawling complex of Chinese-themed attractions in New York’s Catskill Mountains. Billed as China City of America, the sprawling park was initially designed to include a shopping mall, amusement park, Chinese historical attractions, and residential and office space. It’s since been scaled back and rebranded as an educational institution called the “Thompson Education Center.”Li initially intended to fund the project using foreign financing through the EB-5 visa program, according to the project’s website. The EB-5 program grants U.S. visas to foreign investors in domestic businesses. It’s not clear whether that remains the plan or if this is the reason for her political giving. Li did not respond to numerous emails and phone calls seeking comment on this story.As plans for China City have been scaled back, a new Chinese-themed venture has emerged. On paper, it has ties to Li’s network of New York businesses. The group is called the “United Nations Mao Zedong Foundation,” and records on file with the government of New York indicate that it shares an address with Li’s China City and a host of other businesses with which she’s involved.The Mao Zedong Foundation is run by Chinese national and permanent U.S. resident Wu Guofa, a Boston resident who has also donated to Republican politicians and political groups. His online CV is sprinkled with prestigious-sounding titles earned through contributions to GOP political organs, such as “Member, Presidential Business Commission for President George W. Bush,” an old NRCC honorific.Wu, who has also gone by Felix, founded a previous version of the Mao Zedong Foundation in 2010. He told state regulators in Massachusetts, where it was initially incorporated, that the foundation would be “supporting research on Mao Zedong and Maoism” and “supporting social activities for justice worldwide,” among other activities.A translation of the group’s Chinese language website lists another set of goals: completely eliminating war and poverty around the world, and “establishing the community of human destiny proposed by [Chinese president] Xi Jinping.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Massachusetts regulators revoked the foundation’s corporate status in 2012, records show. But in December 2017, Wu formed a new version of it in New York. Incorporation records list its address as 2 Centre View Drive in Oyster Bay, New York. Its website says that’s the group’s “global liaison headquarters,” and that its “global management headquarters” is in Hong Kong. The Oyster Bay address is the same one on file for 15 different companies that list Li as an officer in official state records. It’s not clear what exactly the Mao Zedong Foundation does on a day-to-day basis. Its website claims that Wu has been awarded a host of honorary titles in the U.S. and China, including, most recently, an invitation to a recent state banquet in Beijing. He also claims to have advised a number of provincial governments in China. An organization celebrating China’s brutal dictator, and the current leadership of its ruling Communist Party, is not the sort of affiliation one expects to see from a major Republican fundraiser. And neither Li nor Wu returned numerous phone calls and emails seeking clarification on this and other matters. But that’s to be expected. Li rarely, if ever, talks to the press, issuing her statements mainly through press releases in which she boasts of her meetings with Republican officeholders and Trump administration officials. She even claims to have conversed with the president himself at a campaign event in 2016, according to a press release issued after the election. “As a real estate developer,” Li says she told Trump, “I share the same American dream and the same American value with you.”—with additional reporting by Sam Stein"},
 {'title': '‘Inhumane’: Advocates Decry the Separation of Families at Border',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Reports of children being separated at the southern border of the U.S. have been circulating for months. Now, on account of a new U.S. policy aimed at prosecuting everyone who crosses the border illegally, more families will be ripped apart, advocates say.Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy at a Monday afternoon news conference in Arizona, revealing that the U.S. will be prosecuting parents and separating children from them in an effort to deter families from making the trip in the first place.“If you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law," Sessions said, according to NBC News. “If you don\'t like that, then don\'t smuggle children over our border.” One protester with a megaphone interrupted Sessions during his announcement. “Are you going to be separating families?... Why are you doing this? Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?” he shouted. “You’re an evil, evil, evil man!”After their parents are charged, children will be turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, which will refer them to relatives or to shelters, according to NBC News.“Needlessly ripping kids, toddlers, babies away from their parents is inhumane, barbaric and unconstitutional,” Sandy Santana, executive director of Children’s Rights, told The Daily Beast in a statement. “An administration that purports to uphold family values is callously inflicting devastating trauma on children and families in service of its punitive immigration policies.”“We do not, have not, and never will support the separation of families,” said Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. “In fact, we will condemn it in the strongest terms.”The Migration Policy Institute called the move an “overreaction” that may be only marginally effective in deterring people from crossing the border.“Defining this as a crisis and a security risk is overstated,” said Doris Meissner, director of Migration Policy\'s U.S. Immigration Policy Program. “It may very well reduce numbers for awhile, maybe a couple of weeks. It\'s really a question of how the policy is enforced after that.” This issue has been a hair raiser for those in immigration advocacy for quite some time. A study found that as of 2011, over 5,000 children were living in foster care because they were “prevented from uniting with their detained or deported parents.” According to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security reported that 700 children have been separated from their parents since October 2017.In January, 74 national organizations signed a letter to DHS asking them to reconsider family separation at the border.“This proposed policy is fundamentally un-American, cruel, and breaches U.S. and international child welfare and refugee principles and laws. Family separation will only further traumatize those already fleeing harm, and will inhibit their ability to access a legal process to which they have a right,” the letter read. “Secretary Nielsen, we implore you to respect the principles of family unity and liberty in our immigration and border enforcement policies.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'GOP Rep. Patrick Meehan Resigns Amid Harassment Claims',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Republican Rep. Pat Meehan (R-PA), who represents Pennsylvania’s 7th congressional district, announced Friday that he will resign his seat. The embattled lawmaker previously said he would not seek re-election following revelations that he used taxpayer funds to settle a sexual-harassment claim. The House Ethics Committee had initiated a probe into his conduct following allegations from a former aide that Meehan had expressed unwanted romantic advances towards her. He also reportedly turned hostile towards her when she became involved in a relationship.  “With the knowledge I would not be standing for another term, I have decided that stepping down now is in the interest of the constituents I have been honored to serve,” Meehan said in a statement.\xa0“I have stayed to fight for important priorities like fully funding our troops, increasing support for medical research and preserving promising clean energy solutions. And now that work is accomplished.”Meehan said he already submitted his resignation letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Pennsylvania’s Democratic Governor Tom Wolf. Meehan went on to say that he thought he would be exonerated of wrongdoing in the course of an ethics committee investigation but did want to put his staff through that process and instead allow them to seek new employment. “I will pay $39,000.00 to the U.S. Treasury to reimburse for the severance payment that was made from my office account," Meehan asserted. “That payment will be made within 30 days of my resignation from the House of Representatives. I did not want to leave with any question of violating the trust of taxpayers.”Meehan’s district, previously drawn in moose-antler fashion around Philadelphia, was redrawn for November’s midterm elections, taking it from a district that favored Hillary Clinton by two points to one that would have favored her by some 28 points. The state will now be highly determinative in Democratic efforts to back the House of Representatives. Gov. Wolf will have to decide if he will call for two special elections in the state—one for Meehan and one for moderate Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) who also recently announced his intent to resign before the end of his term. Earlier this month, Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) similarly resigned his post following revelations of a taxpayer-funded harassment settlement—although without the explicit promise to back that money.'},

 {'title': 'If Trump Calls Kim Jong Un A ‘Fat Toad,’ His Interpreter Will Have to Translate It',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When Donald Trump meets with Kim Jong Un sometime in the next two months, there is a non-zero chance that the high-stakes nuclear summit descends into rounds of school-yard taunting. Should Trump call Kim “fat” and should Kim respond by calling Trump a “dotard”—as each, remarkably, has done in the past—it will fall on their respective interpreters to deliver those broadsides in the other’s dialect. And though doing so might precipitate a nuclear holocaust, there is nothing that can be done about it. The words will be translated. “Yes, of course,” said Dimitry Zarechnak, who served as Ronald Reagan’s interpreter during his summit with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, when asked if Trump’s interpreter would have to tell Kim that the president called him “little Rocket man.” The discussions surrounding a potential Trump-Kim summit is already fairly volatile. The president agreed to the meeting on a whim. But as recently as this past Thursday, he signalled his displeasure at having to go through with it at all. “This should have been done by somebody before they were in the position that they’re in right now,” he said at a White House event. It’s not entirely clear if Trump will, in fact, go through with it. His former top adviser, Steve Bannon, has expressed his belief that it will be logistically impossible to pull off. And the appointment of former UN Ambassador John Bolton—a man who seems more disposed to preemptively bombing North Korea then talking with its leaders—as the new national security adviser makes the likelihood of a summit even more remote. But should it transpire, one of the more critical responsibilities will fall on the interpreters. The role that they play in presidential tete-a-tetes is often overlooked, if not entirely ignored. And for good reason. The interpreter is, at his or her most basic level, a oratorical tool for a conversation between other individuals. They are accessories, not players. But they don’t just robotically translate words either (indeed, they scoff at being called “translators” as opposed to “interpreters”). Often, indeed, their job involves a fair amount of intuition, study, and diplomacy. \xa0Those tasks become exceptionally more difficult at a summit with world leaders. For the one set to happen between Trump and Kim, the hurdles are even higher, do to the enigmatic nature of both leaders and the existential nature of the talks.“These are historical talks, if they happen. And the interpreter will play a huge part in this,” said Judy Jenner, a Translation/Interpreting Studies faculty member at U.C. San Diego and a member of the American Translators Association. Kim, she said, “doesn’t speak English, as far as we know.” And as for Trump, “If you know him and worked for him it would be easier. But he is a significant interpreting challenge.”Interpreting has been around for as long as the need has existed for people to converse between languages. Jenner playfully calls it humanity’s “second oldest profession,” though the actual professionalization of the practice has an unclear history. Interpreters played vital roles in commerce, exploration, religion and scholarship dating as far back as antiquity. More modern, formalized interpreting has been witnessed in judicial settings—think, the Nuremberg trials—and diplomatic gatherings—think, Nicole Kidman’s turn as the United Nations interpreter who overheard too much in the movie aptly titled The Interpreter. \xa0Those who practice it say interpreting is both an art and a science. It is a science in that interpreting involves the systematic study of dialect and diplomacy. The competition within the State Department to be considered a top interpreter in a prospective field is intense. It is an art in that there are unique styles and it’s not always precise. Indeed, when Trump speaks to Kim, a fair amount of editorial leeway will fall on his interpreter to communicate what exactly the president is saying. “Any kind of translation or interpretation is the rendering of the idea from one language to another,” is how Zarechnak put it. “The term ‘literal’ or ‘word-for-word’ doesn’t mean anything because it is always subject to interpretation.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.What Zarechnak is getting at is the distinction that exist between the two main types of interpreting. There is the so-called “simultaneous” model, which is when the speaker and the interpreter talk virtually at the same time. This is the version practiced by Nicole Kidman: headset on, speaking into a transmitter that blurts out the speech in a different language to those on the other end of the line. It is cognitively, incredibly challenging. The second kind of interpreting is “consecutive.” In this setting, the interpreter sits next to the person for whom they’re interpreting and take notes as he or she is talking. It is only when that person is done that the interpreter translates the comments into the other language. “That is the holy grail of interpreting,” said Jenner, noting the incredible difficulties that come with mastering this craft. Interpreters must have subject matter expertise, so that they don’t get flummoxed by complex matters or provincial phrases and topics. And they must learn a special note-taking system that allows them to keep up with the conversation. “It takes thousands of hours of practice to get to a good technique,” Jenner added. “The good ones don’t even need to take a lot of notes.” Consecutive interpreting—which will be used when Trump meets Kim—is easiest when the speaker talks slowly and stays on script. Former President Barack Obama, Jenner said, did both. “His speech was very beautiful and he wasn’t particularly fast,” said Jenner. “He was just a great natural orator.”Oratorically, Trump couldn’t be more different. The president rarely stays on talking points and often has a disjointed speaking style. He doesn’t make up words. But their meaning is not always readily apparent. Occasionally, he will contradict himself in a matter of moments. “He is difficult to interpret,” said Jenner. “Usually, the clearer you are as a speaker the easier it is. If you ramble a lot, and don’t speak in full sentences, and leave thoughts hanging, it isn’t easy to interpret.” Precisely understanding what Trump hopes to convey is one hurdle. Translating it for Kim’s interpreter is another. Korean is the language of the North. But there are idiosyncrasies that separate it from the more commonly used version of the South. Mainly, there are fewer foreign words and influences that have made it into the dialect, owing to the country’s isolated status globally. “I had no problem understanding them,” said Jacki Noh, a long-time interpreter who worked on the nuclear-arms-focused Six Party Talks with North Korea in 2003. “But sometimes they had a problem understanding me when I was using the South Korean words.” Ultimately, Noh said, the language barriers should pose few, if any, problems for whoever is tasked with interpreting for Trump. And if there is enough preparation before the talks, the president’s penchant for going off script can be surmountable too. An interpreter can, in the end, make adjustments on the fly. Zarechnak said that twice, maybe three times, in his career, he paused a translation in order to first clarify a clear error that his speaker had made. The conversation stopped, reversed course, and then started all over again. What he’s never done is deliberately soften a message because of the geopolitical horrors that could ensue upon its delivery. “No,” said Zarechnak, “I’ve never gone rogue.” "},
 {'title': 'The Democratic 2020 Presidential Hopefuls Show Their, Uh, Stuff at the Center for American Progress',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'It’s the first game of the grapefruit league season, so to speak—the Center for American Progress’ annual May confab, where many of the expected contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination come to show their stuff. Some Third World-ish traffic—I sat on one single block of Independence Avenue for about 40 minutes—denied me the privilege of seeing Sherrod Brown (who I doubt is running anyway), Amy Klobuchar (who probably is but who isn’t generating the buzz she was a year ago), and Julian Castro (who… is, I guess?). But I saw enough of the biggies—Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren—to get the picture.So here’s my observation. I heard a lot of words from that stage, the usual Democratic buzz words, and they’re all good words. The event showcased some young talent (I was impressed by environmental activist Mustafa Ali) and gave a few somewhat more familiar faces a chance to shine (New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was surprisingly effective, spending the bulk of his 20 minutes talking about crime reduction, which was an interesting thing for a liberal to emphasize to a roomful of liberals, stressing that in his New York, cops are now known to give citizens their email addresses and cell phone numbers, “because there’s a different reality, a different focus, a different bond between police and community.”) I heard many interesting things. But one word I didn’t hear much at all surprised me. “Trump.”I sat there, about an hour in, realizing: This is just a huge difference these days between Democrats and Republicans. I thought back to the similar conservative gatherings I’d covered over the years. The annual CPAC conference mostly, although that’s not quite fair because it goes on for days and is much larger than this CAP event. But other smaller ones, too. At their gatherings, conservatives hardly do anything except mock liberals. Well, that and throw out red-meat applause lines, about bombing Iran into the Iron Age or whatever. But every other sentence at a conservative confab is Hillary this, Obama that. And it gives the thing some zest. People applaud, they scream, they laugh, they chant; it’s an orgiastic experience these days, a conservative political conference.A Democratic one, by contrast, is a college colloquium. Elizabeth Warren was the keynoter, speaking on the need to repair our democracy; she was fine, all her proposals were laudable, and unlike all the others she actually did jab at Trump a couple times (“men like Trump only wind up in power when democracies are decayed,” she said). But she moved on pretty quickly and didn’t stray much from her subject, which was not her main wheelhouse of economic justice issues.The lunch keynoter was Booker. He had the right idea, thematically. The core of his talk was that we as a nation simply aren’t investing in ourselves and our future anymore, which I think has the potential to resonate strongly with moderate voters. “The things we used to do to built out this nation,” he said. “It’s like we built this house, and we trashed it.” But he doesn’t quite have the inspiring words yet, and he was kind of jargony. He used “intensivity” twice. Which was twice more than he used “Trump.” “I was taught at an early age, don’t curse the darkness,” he said. “Light a candle.” No—curse the darkness! There’s a lot of it out there, and the people in that room (high rollers and other liberal insiders) are damn well freaked out about it. Curse it! At least make one cutting joke about it!Instead, nothing. Even Sanders didn’t say anything about Trump. He was billed as speaking about criminal justice, which he totally ignored, and just gave his usual spiel, which now includes the curiosity-piquing formulation—he clearly likes it, as he repeated it—that three Americans (he did not name them, interestingly) own more wealth than the 160 million Americans who constitute the bottom half of the income graph. Gillibrand focused her remarks on women: “The next chapter of the women’s movement is being written right now,” which I thought was a decent line; at least it acknowledged history. It’s the first time I’ve seen her speak in person. I didn’t have the sense that her self-confidence, which of course needs to be overwhelming to the point of an obsession in a presidential candidate, was there yet.It was billed as an “ideas festival,” so maybe the idea, so to speak, was to accentuate the positive and not make it too down-and-dirty political. Maybe that’s fine. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying Democrats should be just like Republicans. The Republicans have zero ideas, if you don’t consider turning a blind eye to the daily offenses of a con man and grifter an idea. They have nothing to offer the country intellectually. They’re little more these days than a slot machine for their donors, now with the added disgrace of allowing Dear Leader to skim his take off the top.The Democrats have ideas, and they should be true to their DNA. But surely they can do that and get in a few jabs. God knows, liberals need some laughs at Trump’s expense. And they need some anger, too. Democrats will always err in the direction of being less confrontational than Republicans; think back, if you’re old enough, to John Kerry ordering no direct denunciations of George W. Bush from the floor of the 2004 convention. And yes, whoever becomes the candidate will need a positive message. But Trump is liberals’ daily reality. Democratic voters will nominate the person who combines that positive message with a frank assessment of the grim truth--and who demonstrates that he or she can stand up to the bully.'},
 {'title': 'ICE Wants Drones',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are looking to use drones as part of their work, according to two current officials in the agency. “The agents all want to use them, for sure,” said one official. “The agents love toys. Anything that’s going to enhance them they want to use.”The official said people in the agency are currently taking steps to move toward crafting policies for agents to use drones. At some point next month, ICE officials are expected to meet to begin discussing the groundwork for the use of drones. The official described it as “preliminary stuff.” A second ICE official said many agents believe using drones will help them when executing narcotics warrants—dangerous no-knock raids that can result in the deaths of both law-enforcement agents and civilians. Drones could be used to see if a sniper was on the roof of a building before agents entered, or if people with weapons were in the backyard of a house. Drones could also be used for surveillance and general law-enforcement activities. A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment for this story. ICE has two components: Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which arrests people and detains them before they are deported, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which investigates transnational crime, including drug trafficking. HSI officials are taking the lead on the conversations regarding drone use. This revelation concerns civil-liberties advocates. Robyn Greene, policy counsel New America’s Open Technology Institute, told The Daily Beast she worries any internal ICE rules governing drone use may be insufficient to protect people’s privacy—especially given the increasing prevalence of facial recognition technology. “You’re just creating an eye in the sky that will watch whoever is in the vicinity of its range and potentially identify them,” she said. “As technology becomes more advanced, and especially as things like facial recognition technology are adapted to drones, you wind up with situations where you can literally be conducting individualized surveillance on dozens if not more people—potentially hundreds of people at any given time,” she added. And Jake Laperruque, senior counsel at The Project On Government Oversight, also said the revelation is worrisome. “It’s critical that there’s transparency on what exactly they’re doing and how many people it effects and also it’s critical that there be indep oversight and authorization to make sure that it’s not abused,” he said. ICE would not be the only agency within the Department of Homeland Security to use drones. The Border Patrol uses drones, and so does the Coast Guard.

Dianne Feinstein that the Bureau uses drones in a “very, very minimal way, very seldom.” “It is still in nascent stages but it is worthy of debate and legislation down the road,” Mueller said at the time, according to The Guardian. In the years since then, the FBI’s reliance on drones seems to have grown beyond the nascent stages. A DOJ Inspector General report published in March of 2015 found that the Department of Homeland Security had used drones to support the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration dozens of times. The Atlantic noted in 2016 that the Pentagon has used drones to on American soil, and that the DEA has used drones as well. ICE agents aren’t just ambitious about drone use. The Daily Beast reported earlier this year that some officials in the agency have been pushing for it to formally join the Intelligence Community. That prospect drew criticism from many IC officials and veterans. "},
 {'title': 'Fox News Tells Trump: Bomb Syria—Now',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Monday morning, Bassam Rifai, a political adviser at the Syrian American Council, appeared on the Fox News program Happening Now to urge President Donald Trump to escalate in Syria in the aftermath of the reported deadly chemical weapons attack.“I would be surprised if I didn’t see any strikes,” Rifai said. “The president needs to take swift and decisive action right now.”Then he turned to face the camera.“President Trump, I am speaking to you directly,” he continued. “Do not take the same mistakes that President Obama had made… What we need to do right now is to take out... Assad’s air force.”When asked Monday afternoon if he wanted to appear on Fox News on Monday, instead of CNN or MSNBC, to try to get a message to the president—a habitual Fox watcher—Rifai simply told The Daily Beast, “Yes, that’s correct.”Though Trump had multiple meetings on Syria with senior administration officials on Monday, Rifai was correct in assessing that what the president watches on Fox News can often influence his actions and rhetoric as much, if not more so, than the counsel of his top West Wing aides.And Rifai was hardly alone on the Fox airwaves. In fact, several personalities and guests on Fox & Friends—perhaps the most influential TV show on the face of the planet right now—have been pushing Trump since Sunday morning to order another military strike against the Bashar al-Assad regime as the remarkably brutal Syrian civil war continues unabated.On Sunday morning, less than half an hour before Trump condemned the attack on Twitter, Fox & Friends ran a segment on the “DOZENS DEAD IN SYRIA.” Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner ended the segment by stating, “All eyes now, guys, will now be on President Trump to see what his response is... After a chemical attack last year, he ordered airstrikes that decimated a Syrian airbase, a move that garnered praise from America’s allies around the world.”Later that morning, after venting on Twitter about Hillary Clinton, the FBI, and The Washington Post, the president tweeted, “Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price…to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!”President Trump added, knocking his predecessor, “If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!”But of course, the carnage has continued. Assad pledged back in 2013 to give up his stockpile of deadly chemical weapons—including tons of the nerve agent sarin.U.S. officials now believe that Assad’s forces likely used sarin in its gruesome assault on the Damascus suburb of Douma, although those officials stress that they don’t have anything approaching definitive proof yet. After previous sarin attacks, the U.S. was able to intercept calls between Syrian military officers discussing the chemical strikes, or obtain samples of the suspect nerve agent.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But what’s in the press is pretty damning,” one U.S. official told The Daily Beast. “The majority of those fatalities”—with mouths foaming and pupils the size of pinpricks—“look like they were sarin-induced.”And those attacks, which left dozens dead and hundreds injured, appear to have been effective. Before the bombing, the Syrian military was negotiating with the rebel group Jayish al-Islam. After the bombing, the group’s fighters in Douma all-but-surrendered.Some pictures of the aftermath seemed to show barrel bombs with the industrial chemical chlorine. The U.S. official said it’s possible Assad’s military used both chlorine and sarin in the attack.“It wouldn’t be the first time,” the official added. “They’re hitting people in Douma with everything they have.”It wasn’t too long ago that Trump took a softer approach toward Assad; during the presidential campaign, Trump said, “I don’t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.”On Sunday, Fox & Friends welcomed lawyer Alan Dershowitz, a liberal law professor who over the past year has frequently bashed President Trump’s legal antagonists, who also told viewers (perhaps one viewer in particular) that, “well, I think the president has no choice. He must respond. And I think he will respond. He won’t make the tragic mistake that President Obama, for whom I voted, made... The United States has to do something about it. We’re the only game in town.”Numerous White House officials and sources close to Trump have told The Daily Beast that one of the most effective ways to compel the president to do something is tell him that he could be strong where Obama was weak, and that he can do right where his predecessor did nothing.When asked by a host asked if such a response should include airstrikes or anything similar, Dershowitz replied that last year’s strikes on Assad’s Shayrat air base in response to a prior attack was “the minimum of what [Trump] has to do.” Most U.S. action against Assad must be done “in the name of humanity,” Dershowitz said, a sentiment that mirrors what Trump would say at the White House the following day.“I think this president will stand strong… and I hope he can stop this guy [Assad],” Dershowitz said. “Nobody else has stopped him.”Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a former Trump adversary who has since become the president’s golfing buddy, appeared on Monday’s edition of Fox & Friends to throw in his two cents and convey his pro-interventionist message to Trump.“I think now he is a legitimate war criminal in the eyes of the international community, and that Assad and his inner circle should be considered war criminals, legitimate military targets,” the senator said. “If you have the opportunity to take him out, you should. You should ground his air force. You should destroy his air force.”Graham’s ex-colleague, former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), swung by Fox & Friends to say “I appreciate President Trump’s outrage at the use of chemical weapons, and now I think we and our allies have to follow up and it ought to be strong—we should hit their military.”“I think everything should be on the table,” Lieberman also noted—something with which President Trump concurs.Not everyone on Fox News was beating the drums of war, like Tucker Carlson. “Leaders on both sides of the aisle in Congress, in the media and our intelligence services and virtually every overfunded think tank in Washington have suddenly aligned tonight on a single point of agreement: America must go to war in Syria immediately,” Tucker Carlson said at the top of his primetime Fox News show Monday night. Expressing “skepticism,” the host added, “All the geniuses tell us that Assad killed those children, but do they really know that? Of course they don’t really know that. They are making it up. They have no real idea what happened.”On Monday, the president told reporters that his administration would decide in the next “24 to 48 hours” how to respond to the Assad regime, and added that “nothing is off the table.”—with additional reporting by Andrew Kirell"},
 {'title': "New Quotas for Immigration Judges Are 'Incredibly Concerning,' Critics Warn",
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Justice Department will put new quotas on immigration judges, an official there confirmed to The Daily Beast. Critics of the move say it will result in speedier deportations of asylum-seekers, robbing them of due process. The decision’s defenders, meanwhile, say it will help reduce the massive backlog of people waiting to have their cases heard in immigration court. James McHenry, who heads the DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, announced the change in an email Friday to immigration judges around the country. The Justice Department official said the new metrics will require immigration judges to complete three cases per workday, and that the immigration judges’ union allowed metrics to be put in place during its most recent round of collective bargaining. McHenry’s email was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. “We’re incredibly concerned in that judges should not feel undue pressure to dispose of these cases rapidly in an effort to manage the enormous backlog,” Laura Lynch, senior policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told The Daily Beast. “We’re very concerned that cases will be rushed through the system and due process will be circumvented with these new quotas.”The new regimen will require some judges to adjudicate cases more quickly than they have been. The average cases completed per year by immigration judges, per the official, is fewer than 680. The new metric will require judges to complete 700 cases per year. Lynch said that making judges move more quickly will mean that some migrants facing deportation will have less time to get lawyers. “We’re going to see vulnerable populations, such as asylum seekers, being rushed through the system without the opportunity to obtain an immigration attorney, without an opportunity to present evidence, to present their claim in a manner that’s appropriate with due process,” Lynch said. “We’re concerned that due process protections will not be afforded to these individuals due to the rushed process.”The immigration court backlog is currently more than 680,000 cases, according to Syracuse University. “This is a recipe for disaster,” A. Ashley Tabaddor, an immigration judge who heads the National Association of Immigration Judges, told the Journal. “You are going to, at minimum, impact the perception of the integrity of the court.”Dana Marks, a spokesperson for the immigration judges’ union, told The Daily Beast that the change could actually increase the case backlog since it may make more people want to appeal.“Unfortunately, people who come before us are going to be less confident that they’re getting independent and fair decisions and they’re going to have a greater incentive to follow an appeals process, to have someone else look over the judges shoulder,” she said.'},

That alarm is a reminder that, seven days a week, she is living her lifelong dream of owning a bakery.“I come in at two-thirty in the morning. We start making doughnuts from scratch. After that, I go into the breads and pies or whatever I have going out—like right now I need to do cupcakes, and I have a couple pies I have to put out, but I also have to check what orders are going out. Then we start soups, and by eleven o’clock we start lunch,” she explains.At sixty-three, she is two years into her second career in the small town of Jefferson, running a Chestnut Street bakery that is a throwback to simpler times: pretty pink-and-green wallpaper decorated with cupcakes surrounds a fireplace and tables and chairs that fill the front of the bakery.By 9 a.m., already half of her sugar cookies, tea cakes, cream wafers, brownies, mini tarts, and thumbprints are gone. With the help of her grandson, a fresh batch of sugary glazed doughnuts makes its way from the kitchen to a tray in the display case.The aroma is irresistible and intoxicating and gently teases the senses.A young mother enters with her three-year-old daughter, Evelyn, who immediately makes a beeline to the display case filled with colorful cookies and pastries and, with the willfulness and determination only a toddler possesses, plants her face against the case to get a closer look at the cupcake with rainbow sprinkles on top.To the girl’s delight, Smith hands her the confection, and minutes later Evelyn’s face and fingers are covered in pink icing. The imprint of her little face on the display case—a smudged outline of a tiny nose and lips—makes Smith smile broadly.As Smith started making soup for the anticipated lunch crowd, the diminutive brunette was sporting a white apron with Legally Sweet embroidered across the front, the name of her shop and a hat tip to her 30-plus years at the Ashtabula County Sheriff’s Office.She started working as a cook in the sheriff’s department when the youngest of her three children was five years old. It was the same job her mother had.But Smith wanted more.So she went back to school for criminal law while she worked as a cook in the courthouse. She then moved over to dispatch and up through the ranks in the sheriff’s department until she made deputy, all the while raising her three children with her husband, an electrician for Millennium Inorganic Chemicals—one of the last big blue-collar employers in the once-mighty manufacturing county of Ashtabula, wedged between the shore of Lake Erie and the Pennsylvania state line, northeast of Cleveland.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Smith was raised a Democrat, her parents were Democrats, she is married to a Democrat, and she worked for elected Democratic sheriffs in a county that had not voted a Republican into local office for as long as anyone you find can remember.Until 2016, that is, when Ashtabula picked Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton and swept in a local ticket of Republicans underneath him.Bonnie Smith was one of the unlikely participants in that unforeseen realignment that happened across the Great Lakes region in hundreds of communities like Ashtabula County, flipping Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Iowa into the Republican side of the electoral college after serving as what journalist Ron Brownstein dubbed the reliable industrial Democratic “Blue Wall” for decades.How Democratic was Smith, and how recently? In March 2016, she voted for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the Ohio primary contest. Voting Republican wasn’t even on the table for her, until suddenly it was, just a few months later.“I am not sure what happened, but I started to look around me, and my town and my county, and I thought, ‘You know what? I am just not in the mood anymore to just show up and vote for who my party tells me I have to vote for,’” she says.She was not alone. Ashtabula County had given its votes to John Kerry, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, and Michael Dukakis. It gave Barack Obama a 55 percent majority share of its vote twice—before turning 180 degrees to prefer Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 57 percent to 38 percent, a 31-point swing from one election to the next.At first look, the numerical magnitude of Ashtabula’s swing, in a nation presumed frozen in partisan polarization, is what seems notable. At second look, the remarkable aspect is just how common that kind of change was in 2016 in the states that make up the Rust Belt.Thirty-five counties in Ohio, long the nation’s premier presidential bellwether, swung 25 or more points from 2012 to 2016. Twenty three counties in Wisconsin, 32 counties in Iowa, and 12 counties in Michigan switched from Obama to Trump in the space of four years.With few exceptions, these places are locales where most of America’s decision makers and opinion leaders have never been. Trump only carried 3 of the nation’s 44 “mega counties,” places with more than one million in population, and only 41 of the country’s 129 “extra large” counties with more than 400,000 but less than one million. Those 173 sizable counties are home to 54 percent of the U.S. population, and in 135 of them Trump even lagged behind the net margin performance of losing 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Trump crawled out of that mathematical hole in the all-but-forgotten communities—thousands of them.It took a lot of Bonnie Smiths, in a lot of places like Ashtabula County, to wreck political expectations—and if their political behavior in 2016 becomes an affiliation and not a dalliance, they have the potential to realign the American political construct and perhaps the country’s commercial and cultural presumptions as well.For Smith, who lives with her husband, George, on a working farm in nearby Saybrook, the political tipping point—even more than the job losses and the decay of the area—was a result of her faith and her growing disconnect on cultural issues from the candidates she had previously supported.“I had looked the other way for far too long, had accepted that I was supposed to be more modern in my views when I wasn’t comfortable with the views my party started to take,” Smith says, making clear that this was a difficult decision to have made and to discuss publicly. “And I took a stand for myself, my beliefs, for life, and for my country.”She says she also took a stand for her community: “All of this decay has happened under their [the Democrats’] watch.”The shopping district where Legally Sweet sits is struggling; a Family Dollar store is around the corner, and the majestic Ashtabula County courthouse, where she worked for years, is across the street. Shuttered businesses dot both sides of the street.“The town closes up about three o’clock on the weekdays and, like, one o’clock on Saturday. There’s nothing here. The people come in and… you’re making it but you’re not. You know? You’ve got enough to skimp by for the next day, but that’s it,” she says.The statistics on the area’s own economic development website paint a picture of an Ashtabula County stuck in transition and trying to creatively reinvent itself to get out of the Great Recession, from which the wealthier America on the East and West coasts recovered years ago. As of May 2016, the local economic partnership wrote that the county’s employed workforce level was still stuck under 42,000 people—nearly the same figure as at the bottom of the national recession in 2010, a fall from 46,000 in its pre-recession high.2 Nationally, the number of employed Americans had bounced back to pre-recession levels by 2014.The physical reality of the county’s industrial footprint tells the same story. Empty, idle, hulking coal-fired power plants line the lakeshore, and the docks that once attracted waves of Italian and Scandinavian immigrants to unload coal and iron ore now see little activity. The county’s population, according to the Census Bureau’s 2016 estimates, is 98,231, almost exactly what it was after the 1970 census, a span that saw the country as a whole grow by 59 percent.A Democrat for decades, Smith didn’t quite know what to expect when she went home one day and told George she was thinking about supporting Trump. He told her he was already there. “So there was that,” she says, laughing.America’s political experts, from party leaders to political science professors to journalists to pundits, did not expect the Smiths, or enough people like them, to vote for Donald Trump. Virtually every political and media expert missed the potential of Trump because they based their electoral calculus on assumptions that they hadn’t bothered to check since the last presidential election. To recognize the potential of the Trump coalition, analysts would have had to visit places they had stopped visiting and listen to people they had stopped listening to.“I am kind of that voter that was hiding in plain sight that no one saw coming. I was right here all along. I’ve seen the job losses here, the rise in crime, the meth and heroin problem, society essentially losing hope; something just gave in with me,” Bonnie Smith says.Viroqua, Vernon County, WisconsinJoe Keenan looks like a guy who has spent his entire life working with his hands. They are callused and faintly smudged—not because they are unclean but because years of tinkering, plowing, and bailing have left their marks. And they are muscular, a sign of the constant use of them over a lifetime.“Oh yeah, I grew up on a farm,” Keenan says, and subconsciously rubs his hands together.At around five-eleven, he has a stocky build. His sandy brown hair and beard are sprinkled with gray, and while both are cropped short, the humidity from a fresh rain causes wiry curls to emerge.He is wearing blue jeans and a royal blue pocket T-shirt with a Joe’s Repair logo over his left breast pocket; he is a quick-witted, to-the-point, pure no-nonsense Midwesterner who loves to laugh at his own puns.Keenan is sitting with a group of acquaintances at the VFW in Viroqua on a shiny red barstool; he is a stone’s throw from his home and the small business he owns.This is the place to get a drink in this town of four thousand souls.Located in the southwest corner of Wisconsin, surrounded by the lush Driftless region, with the Mississippi to the west and the Kickapoo River running through the center, Vernon County includes a latticework of throwback small farms in an era of large conglomerate-farming enterprises.“The geography of the area helped us keep our farms smaller and family-owned,” says Keenan of the Driftless region, which is known for the hilly topography that is a hallmark of much of the Upper Mississippi River Valley, a quirk that happened when glaciers that formed ten thousand years ago never reached the area to flatten it.“I grew up here. We moved into the Volk area when I was five. Before that, we were down on the rural edge of Vernon County on the De Soto area. My folks came from Iowa, basically followed their parents from Iowa to Wisconsin. I always like to say only one came across, but there’s a lot of us here now,” he says.“I own a repair shop, farm machines and so forth,” he explains. He mostly makes house calls to repair the farm machinery, essential to local farmers to get their crops out of the ground and out the door in the most expedient way possible. “You break down and can’t move your crops, you don’t get paid; you don’t get paid, you can’t feed your family, your livestock, you are dead,” he explains of the vital work he does to keep area farmers’ businesses rolling when something breaks down.There is a diversity among farmers here; the descendants of the Germans who migrated to the area over a century ago, a robust Amish settlement, and a new wave of organic farmers.Keenan is one of 11 kids; his mother was one of 16, his father one of 8. He started doing serious farm chores at around 6 years old. “We milked the cows. I also was involved in loading hay bales off the wagon. In those days, we didn’t have a thrower and so everything was by hand. We backed the wagons into the haymow and unloaded them by hand and stacked everything. The time-consuming part of it taught you a lot about work. I came from a family that was all about pride in your work,” he says.The social side of Keenan’s life followed true-to-form for a dairy farm kid in western Wisconsin. “When I graduated from high school I married my high school sweetheart.” True to his working-class Catholic roots, Keenan grew up in a Democrat family. “Although I always thought my mom may have been a closet Republican,” he says, laughing.Keenan is not afraid to say who he voted for in 2016; he is also not afraid to say who he voted for in 2008 and 2012.“I voted Obama, Obama, Trump,” he says.Why did he vote for Obama? “Well, in politics change is a potent message and he had a potent delivery. I thought the country needed something different, he was poised, confident, and had a good message and I bought it the first time,” he says.Keenan’s support for Obama was not unusual in Vernon County. The Democrat won 60 percent of the local vote in 2008, beating Senator John McCain by 23 points in this rural rectangle that is home to 30,814 people—a wider margin than he scored statewide.Joe Keenan’s vote the second time for Obama was more personal; he did not care for Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee.“I have a sister who married into the Mormon religion and I find the religion too secretive and controlling for me. I was concerned that might influence how he governed, and so Obama got my vote again,” he says. And again in 2012, Keenan’s vote mirrored the total vote of his rural county on the Mississippi River, which picked the incumbent Democrat over Romney by 15 points.By 2016, Vernon County had flipped to support Donald Trump— both in the presidential primary and in the general election—one of 23 counties in the Badger State to swing from Obama to Trump. Only Iowa saw more localities change hands, as both states moved hard to the GOP. Wisconsin hadn’t been painted red in the electoral college since 1984.Hillary Clinton’s inability to repeat Obama’s victories in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan alone denied her the electoral college majority she needed to become president. She needed only 38,875 voters across those three states to choose her instead of Trump—and she left plenty on the table, getting 598,012 fewer votes in those three states than Obama had, including almost 2,000 fewer in Vernon County alone.Vernon’s history of voting for Democrats is not just a past-tense assessment. In 2016, even as Trump carried it by 5 points, incumbent Republican senator Ron Johnson lost the county to Democrat Russ Feingold, despite carrying the state. Johnson lost Vernon County in his 2010 race too, as did Republican governor Scott Walker in 2014.Keenan finds it comical that some people are embarrassed to admit they voted for the Manhattan businessman, and he uses it to needle them.“Trust me, I am the only person in my family who is not afraid to say I voted for Trump.”He and his relatives are devout Catholics. “It is an important part of who we are, who I am.” They were also devout Democrats.Viroqua is an interesting mix of rural and hipster, or perhaps the better word is “hippie.”On one hand, there are the descendants of farmers who have worked the rich soil for over a century; on the other, there is an evident counterculture on the county seat’s Main Street that seems more Vermont than Vernon County.During the 2016 Democratic Party primary contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Viroqua was plastered with Sanders signs everywhere.The hippie lifestyle here is legit. The local farmers’ market on a warm spring Saturday has tie-dyed shirts, pottery, and organic everything from honey to beets to chocolate. Kickapoo Coffee, an austere shop just across the street with pour-over coffee and organic pastries, has two young men in flannel shirts and full beards playing the fiddle as young people line up for the organic coffee.La Farge, a tiny Vernon County town located along the Kickapoo River, is home to the second-biggest employer in the county behind the medical center: the Coulee Region Organic Produce Pool (CROPP), the farming co-op that makes Organic Valley brand dairy products, and claims to produce four in every ten gallons of organic milk sold in the United States.Organic Valley was born when the small farmers of Vernon County recognized there was power in numbers and formed CROPP. It began as just a seven-farm collective, but today it includes more than a thousand farmers nationwide.Downtown Viroqua is sprinkled with antique stores, trendy shops such as the art gallery that specializes in local artists, and a fair share of closed businesses as well. And the city has received a modicum of national recognition for its “food scene,” with local restaurants serving farm-to-table dishes to draw in customers.An elderly woman outside of the art cooperative sits on a bench watching the crowd of younger families file past her with their organic vegetables, honey, and Amish jams and fruits, and remarks forlornly, “By 3 p.m. no one is on this street; not that way when I was a young woman.”Her reflection expresses part of the complexity of Viroqua—the past of a downtown Main Street filled with shoppers frequenting local stores now struggles to reemerge. The new movement has had some successes, but there are still gaps in the Main Street storefronts. Vernon County’s population after the 2000 census was essentially no different from its head count in the 1900 census—but the decade and a half since 2000 has seen modest growth and, more significantly, the county is now younger than either the state or nation as a whole, the holy grail of statistics for localities in the graying upper Midwest. Twenty-six percent of Vernon Countians are now under the age of 18, increasing the chances that the county can replace its population sustainably.Keenan’s extended family has done its part in that; he grew up with lots of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins living all around him.“Yeah we spent quite a bit of time together. It was always looking forward to the big family gatherings. There was never a shortage of food. Regardless of how many people you had, there was never a shortage of food. You know, it’s funny because when they would do that, it wasn’t just family showing up, it was always the neighbors too,” he says.After high school and a youthful marriage, “I went into the repair business. Farm repair, started at an implement dealer. I always sort of had that knack, of course I followed an older brother who only could break things. So, naturally I learned how to fix the things he broke on the farm,” he says.His wife has a similar background. “We both were basically five miles from each other. It was funny, because we’d taken over both family farms; and when we were dating, ten miles back and forth wasn’t that far, but when you’re hauling feed, ten miles is a long ways,” he says.Keenan raised a family on the farm repair work over the decades. “I made house calls, raised three boys from that business,” he says.His middle son now lives in Japan, teaching English to Japanese students; his youngest son is a nurse and lives in La Crosse. “And my oldest son is 31 and lives with his wife on the family farm. He is really good at breeding cattle.”Going back to his vote for Obama, he repeats: “You know, in politics ‘change’ is a very good line, but I don’t think any of it really meant anything. My vote ended up going for a guy who went back and apologized for everything we have done in our history, that is something that I know I can’t do because I don’t look back on anything that I’ve done. Because if you know that you’re doing right, you can’t go back and apologize,” Keenan says.“So here’s what I haven’t told you: my firstborn was a stillborn child, and she was the little girl. And I know that everything that we go through in our lives makes us who we are today. And that’s for the whole nation. And I can’t imagine going back and apologizing for everything in our lives, because it makes us become stronger for everything that we go through. And the bad things actually make us better, if you aren’t bitter.”They strengthen your character, he adds. “The biggest disappointment with Obama was the direction of the country, it just tanked and I don’t mean the recession, I mean where he took the country in the face of that. I kept hoping he’d get it right, I kept hoping he was going to change, the simple fact is he did want to change the country, but not in the right direction.“Why I liked Trump was because he is going to clean out Washington,” Keenan says. “You know, when I was little I remember going to visit my grandpa and grandma, I got to stay down there for a week. They had just taken this farm property over, which that eventually became the family farm. They were clearing rats out of a building, and I’ll never forget how they got the rats out of the building. It’s the same concept—they have to want to leave. Trump is the kind of guy who is going to make the rats in Washington want to leave, he is going to be so disruptive, so outside the norm, that the swamp will drain because the swamp can’t stand him and how he is running things.“That is how you really change things. You make it so offensive for the swamp rats to be there, so unlike anything they had experienced, rip their power out from under them, and that is what he is doing. But that, that gets the country going in the right direction.“In 2015, when they first walked out on the stage, I truly wanted Ohio’s governor,” Keenan says of eventual third-place finisher John Kasich. A friend sitting three barstools away spits his beer out: “You got to be shitting me!” he says, then apologizes for the mess.“Not when they first walked out, now come on now, think in the moment,” Keenan replies, trying to explain his motives as they both break out into laughter. The Kasich moment, he says, lasted a week; then he went to Trump. By the following spring, when the Wisconsin primary rolled around, Keenan and Vernon County gave Trump a big 11-point margin over his nearest competitor. That support happened even as Trump was losing the state overall by double digits to Senator Ted Cruz, in his biggest stumble on the way to the GOP nomination.“The one thing you saw with Trump is he didn’t pretend to be anything else but himself. Nothing stuck to him. To me, you know, if you aren’t afraid of the skeletons in your closet, you can do a lot of things,” he explains.Since Trump has been in office, Keenan has not regretted his vote, taking the president’s side in his ongoing battles. He has been disappointed in the press and other elected officials, both Democrats and Republicans, in their reactions to Trump. “Well, I think they’re more concerned about destroying him and they have no concern about the country,” he says.“Look, I am never going to blindly support someone again, but I will tell you this: I do like how he is taking on the establishment since becoming president. I like that he doesn’t back down, no matter how exhausting it is; if he is standing up for us, I will stand up for him. It really is just that simple. He is a reflection of our frustrations, but he is also a force that makes people want to be part of, like working together and you accomplish something, part of a thing.“It is like when I finish a job and fix something that no one said could be fixed, or if we are all working together on the farm and accomplishing something, it is being part of that, is what it is like to support Trump, because honestly you are supporting yourself and your country.”Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, PennsylvaniaWithin moments of meeting Ed Harry, you understand he is the kind of guy you want on your side.His impression is blunt and immediate; you also understand that if he were to become an adversary, he would be a relentless opponent.Harry sits in the last booth of D’s Diner, a Plains Township eatery just over the border of Wilkes-Barre’s city limits. He is leaning against the tiled wall facing the dining room and the broad rectangular windows that look out onto the parking lot; white eyelet lace curtains and red-white-and-blue stars in the windows add to the charm of the diner.Up front, the place is filled with customers at a chrome lunch counter as waitresses busily fill coffee cups, take orders, and greet regulars with a warm hello and the universal diner question that implies familiarity: “The usual?”“The usual” repeatedly is, of course, the answer.A double-layered white cake with whipped white icing and toasted coconut sits on the counter covered in a glass cake dome. It is 7:30 in the morning and already two pieces have been served.For 29 years D’s Diner had been Eddie’s Place; when the owner fell ill in late 2016, it closed. But unlike most businesses that close in this county, this one reopened with a new owner and a remodel.But the menu, the hospitality, and the servers remained, as did the loyal customers. The waitress explains there is a line to get a seat at the counter or in a booth on most days; that was certainly the case on this day.Outside on Fox Hill Road, some businesses are gone or vacated; there is a Ford dealership, a pet cemetery, and a smattering of homes.Overlooking the diner on a hillside less than half a mile away is Pennsylvania’s first casino, the Mohegan Sun Pocono.For generations the Wyoming Valley—where Luzerne sits along the banks of the mighty Susquehanna River—has been the home of the quintessential blue-collar worker, the sons and daughters of the sons and daughters of immigrant coal miners and factory hands.Today, Luzerne County is one of the sweet spots for finding the kind of Trump voter who has received the most public attention— the Red-Blooded and Blue-Collared voter.Harry, like so many others in Pennsylvania with a lifetime of loyalty to the Democrats now disrupted by globalism and Donald Trump, fits the bill—and he’s quick to spot others who do too.On this day, seven men under the age of thirty, dressed in utility uniforms and hard hats, take seats across from Harry in an oversized booth. They squeeze a chair in on the end. He nods and smiles; they nod and smile.“You see all of those young men,” he says, loud enough for them to hear, “they probably all voted for Trump. They were all Democrats and they all voted for Trump,” Harry says.Harry orders the ham-and-cheese omelet with white toast; he doesn’t notice that they heard him.As Harry makes his way toward the restroom, one of the young men grins sheepishly, leans over, and says, “Shhhhhhhh, you know we can’t talk politics when we have our company uniforms on,” pauses, and then pulls out the familiar red Make America Great Again ball cap from his back pocket.His friends laugh, as he hurriedly stuffs the ball cap safely back into its hiding place.For most of his life, Harry was a Democrat. He still is. “I wasn’t just a guy who voted straight Democrat up and down the ballot, it was religion to me, it was my identity, and it was also an essential part of my job,” he says.Harry’s father worked the coal mines here in Luzerne County for 33 years, as did his father before him and his father before that, four generations to be exact, part of the great Welsh migration that came to this part of the country in the mid-19th century.When Harry was a senior in high school, his father almost died in a mining accident. “I don’t know how he didn’t die, but his belt got caught on his buddy’s there in a shaft hanging from a 60-degree angle. At that time, he weighed like 260 pounds, so my dad’s weight brought him against the side of the shaft, saved his life,” Harry says.“He came home and walked in the house when he wasn’t supposed to be there. He was working the afternoons, so I wouldn’t expect him home until after 11. He was there like 7, 7:30. I’m doing homework. He comes in and gets a glass and fills it up with whiskey and drinks it straight down, which was quite unusual since he normally drank beer. He filled another glass up and drank half of it and then sat down and started crying.“First time I ever saw my dad cry, and he told me what happened. His biggest concern was, ‘How am I going to support my family now, when I can’t go back in the mines because I’m afraid?’”His father eventually took a Republican patronage job at the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). His son called that moment the time his father “sold his soul.”Harry’s mother was first-generation American, and his maternal grandfather was Russian: “He worked on the railroads, spoke broken English up until the day he died,” he explains.After high school, Harry went to college “mostly to satisfy my parents,” but then the Vietnam War got in the way. Harry spent four years in the U.S. Air Force, two years rotating between Thailand and Vietnam and two years working for the NSA.Harry says his unit’s primary function in Southeast Asia was to cancel attack flights. “If the pilots gave out their strike coordinates in the clear and they get canceled, chances are they’re going to get shot out of the sky, because the Vietnamese had a very sophisticated communications-intercept system. They knew exactly where they were going to come in.“I rotated back just after we broke the whole Laotian war. Our commander was given 12 hours to get to the Philippines to tell them how and where we got that information, because it was top, top, top, top secret. When he came back he said that they had every intelligence organization that existed [in] 1968 and ’69; from the White House intelligence to the Defense Department to the CIA, the NSA, all of them there.”In the end, he wound up on a different assignment. “I had been scheduled to go to train the CIA operatives in Laos on how to use the equipment they never used before. Me, a kid from Allentown.“The funny thing is, when I rotated out, they rotated another kid from Allentown in to do the training. He ended up getting shot, but he survived okay. That’s a long time ago,” Harry says.When Harry came home, the experience left him with the ability to do only two things for an entire year. “I went to night school and I drank. I drank a lot.”But college didn’t really stick, “and drinking has no good end-game,” he says.So he got a job locally, working for a supermarket service, but lasted only a year before he got laid off. “Then I took a job in a state facility, in a mental institution, as a custodian, and honestly, I loved it.”It was there he discovered his calling: persuasion.Harry became part of the organizing force during the explosive rise of public-sector unions in the United States in the early ’70s, which was very similar to the previous rise of industrial-based unions during the Great Depression.Teachers, firefighters, sanitation workers, police officers, as well as secretaries and custodians, beefed up the union membership rolls in record-breaking numbers in the early ’70s.Harry’s job was part of an extensive campaign to turn public-sector facilities in Florida into union facilities.“I would go to mental health centers at five in the morning, stand outside that gate, and pass out notices of a meeting for maybe that night or the next to test the interest of the workers,” he says.Beforehand, he would go in and meet with the management to find out where he should be, or shouldn’t be. “Usually nobody showed up in the beginning, so it’s a process.”He was there for a six-month assignment that turned out to take two years, ending up at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “I was there to win over the custodians, all the maintenance people, all of the assistants to the deans, etc.“It turns out I was very good at winning over the trust and confidence of people. It wasn’t an easy job, you know, these guys understand that if the shop they work in doesn’t become unionized they might be risking their jobs. But I was taught at a young age your work ethic was your word, and whatever you did in your life you were only as good as your word,” he says.After two years he left Florida and brought his skills to work in his hometown. “My job switched to being someone who did contract negotiations, and I also handled arbitration cases and labor board stuff,” he says.When he returned home he found that his father’s patronage job was gone, the Republican governor had termed out of office, and a new Democratic governor, with Democratic patronage hires, was now in charge of PennDOT.“So I am registered as Democrat, which pissed everybody off; I was sort of disowned. To make a long story short, I ended up helping Dad get a job back with PennDOT because of all the Democratic friends I had. I did not participate in my sister’s wedding. I wouldn’t be an usher because we had words over politics.”Eventually they made peace.Politics for him became part of the job; he always voted Democrat; so did his friends. As he rose up in the ranks he became deeply involved in national politics, eventually serving as a delegate at the national convention for Bill Clinton in 1992.From 1980 until he retired he was in charge of the eight or nine northeastern counties in Pennsylvania for the Democrats. “I coordinated all the phone banks, the door-to-door knocks, anything that was related to any election, from gubernatorial elections, to presidential, to local.”Harry also spent much of his time as a union arbitrator, representing members of his union—a position that earned him their trust, a critical relationship to have to convince voters which candidate for office would have your back.Harry adjusts his navy blue Penn State ball cap. At 70, he looks 15 years younger despite his bushy gray hair; his eyes are dark and piercing, his beard trimmed neatly, his voice deep and commanding. If anyone went to central casting looking for a blue-collar union boss type and Harry was in line, he would be the first man picked.The job eventually started to take its toll.“I can remember one arbitration case I had, a PennDOT driver, drunk. Didn’t think anything of it. I go to the arbitration case, he comes in drunk. In our position, you can’t say no to anybody. You have to represent the people—which a lot people thought, ‘How could you?’”He pauses, rubs his deep-set eyes, then continues. “I represented pedophiles, rapists, bookies. I had to. I don’t have any other choice. When you are an arbitrator, that is no different than being an attorney. You have to fulfill that requirement. You’re taking their money, so you have to defend them; good, bad, and the ugly.“I’ve been in the middle of an arbitration case when I find out the evidence that gets presented by the other side and I’m not aware of it, and I should be because my people should be telling me, so I’d call a time-out and say, ‘Let’s go talk’ to the person I am defending.“And I ask them: ‘Did you know about this? Why didn’t you tell me? Well, just so you know, we’re going back in there and the case is over.’ Boom, so I’ve done that, gone back in and said, ‘My apologies for wasting everybody’s time.’ Then I withdraw my grievance and leave. Because that is the right thing to do.”In 2003, he retired after 25 years. “I didn’t want to work any longer. I was burned out. I ended up protecting people who shouldn’t have been protected. They should have been fired. The whole workforce changed from people who looked forward to going to work, to people who make excuses not to,” he says.Even after his retirement, he served as the president of the Greater Wilkes-Barre Labor Council, serving as the powerful business agent for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). He was still the face of the labor movement in Luzerne County, he was still the guy who met with the local politicians, negotiated events, helped folks find jobs, and led protests when Washington stopped listening.But when the establishment Democrats stopped caring about his people, he stopped caring about them.Harry’s fracture from the Democratic Party started with the trade agreements that he says are structured in such a way that they incentivize corporations to base themselves overseas. “Outside of our country they don’t have to worry about paying decent benefits, living wages, and providing salaries as a worker moves up the ladder,” he says.“My party, the party that was supposed to be the party of the working guy, the guy I stood up for and worked for all of my career, was no longer part of this new ascending Democratic coalition. Blue-collar America essentially had the door shut in its face,” he says.Traditionally, Luzerne County has been emblematic of the heart and soul of the working-class wing of the Democratic Party. Its residents personified the character traits of the New Dealers; they supported government social programs that served as a safety net for the residents, they were pro-life, pro-gun, they joined unions and churches alike, they were multidenominational but were likely found in someone’s pew most Sundays.Drive through Wilkes-Barre, or Hazelton, or the dozens of coal-patch towns that make up this Wyoming Valley county, and you will see churches of all denominations clustered in every corner. Each one was built to accommodate the wave of immigrants that flooded this region a hundred years ago, and each represented a different ethnic group that established footholds in tight-knit city blocks.Today, those ethnic churches stand like stone sentinels guarding parishioners who have long been gone; most have closed. In the past decade, dozens of churches have been shuttered, some demolished or left vacant. The once glorious stained-glass windows have been sold or vandalized, their prized artifacts spread to other parishes across the country.The small groceries, movie houses, diners, taverns, and schools that surrounded them are also gone. Many of the homes are worn away by decay, neglect, or abandonment. When the jobs left, the people left.This area thrived during the country’s first industrial revolution. It is sputtering during the technological revolution. Automation and technology are its enemies.“Economically, we have been struggling for a generation, probably two; the mills, factories, and coal mines are essentially all closed, the labor unions have weakened, we don’t have the members or the power to persuade or punish big corporations if they cut jobs or benefits or threaten to pack up and leave if we don’t concede,” he says.Even when the unions did concede, the final humiliation was that those companies left Luzerne County anyway, according to Harry.When this region was nothing more than a frontier settlement, a new form of coal, anthracite, was found along the riverbanks of the Susquehanna all throughout the valley. But that discovery presented a problem: anthracite was so hard and dense, it could not sustain a fire. Tradesmen could use it for forging, and they did during the Revolutionary War, but little else; and no one had yet figured out how it could be used for commerce. It wasn’t until a couple of decades into the 19th century, when Judge Jesse Fell invented an iron grate capable of maintaining a fire using anthracite, that the Wyoming Valley found its way into the center of the Industrial Revolution.That invention changed the course of the Wyoming Valley in the final decades of the 19th century; it brought commerce, great wealth, and a massive migration of European immigrants to the county. Coal-patch towns, unincorporated towns, and company towns began to dot the valley at a rapid pace.The coal brought the canals, the canals brought the railroads, and the railroads brought the rapid transportation of commerce that lured the immigrants, hundreds of thousands of them, including Harry’s ancestors.At the turn of the 20th century, it is estimated that as many as 100,000 immigrants ended up in the coalfields and coal towns of Luzerne County. The first wave came from Wales and England, like Ed Harry’s family; then came the Germans, Poles, Italians, Slovaks, Russians, and Ukrainians. By 1930, immigration had taken Luzerne County to its peak population of 445,109 souls. Today, with only 316,383 people in residence, evidence of the immigrant influence is everywhere, from the architecture to the old ethnic clubs, to the current heritage festivals that dot the county’s calendar.“They were mostly poor people, peasants from the Old Country who came here to make a better life, to become this great thing called ‘an American,’ and to work. Oh, did they work,” says Harry.One hundred years ago, miners here produced nearly 100 million tons of coal—ten years ago that number had tumbled to 1.7 million tons. But even though for decades coal has had barely an echo of its former impact, the people of Luzerne still identified with the life.“It was that promise of a better life that became their identity, and that identity has been passed down generation after generation; even if you never stepped in the same coal mine your father or your grandfather did, you still identified as that being part of who you are,” he says.In an irony only nature could produce, the same high-heat geological forces that made Luzerne’s coal eons ago ensured it would not cash in on the region’s economic boom of the 21st century— fracking. The Marcellus Shale formation that has revitalized much of northern Pennsylvania with oil and gas production ends before it reaches the Luzerne County border, along what one prominent geologist called a “line of death.”The same heat that made the coal “cooked out” whatever gas existed in prior millennia. So while counties just north or west move on to a new fossil-fueled economic era, Luzerne must stare at its past.The enduring self-identity of the mining life is part of the mystery of Luzerne that reporters and pundits and national Democrats missed when calculating who a Luzerne County voter is, according to Harry. They made the same mistake in places like this around the country.Throughout and after the 2016 campaign, national news outlets were full of derision for this easy-to-spot hard-core type of Trump voter. “Trump owes his victory to the uninformed,” screamed a piece in Foreign Policy magazine two days after the election, under the unnuanced headline “Trump Won Because Voters Are Ignorant, Literally.” It became formulaic for analysts who did not understand the Trump voter to ascribe their motivations to either economic desperation or a lack of intelligence, or both. “Why are white, uneducated voters willing to vote for Trump? Job unhappiness to be sure, but I would posit that it is also because they have not been adequately educated to understand just how dangerous a President Trump would be to the Constitution,” wrote one Newsweek pundit.Those insults say more about their writers than the Luzerne County voters who too many journalists, sitting an easy drive away in their New York bureaus, did not come to meet. The common analytical inaccuracy of describing Trump supporters as unthoughtful rubes is driven as much by the lifestyles of the analysts as the intellect of those analyzed.Luzerne County might be just 135 miles from the heart of New York City, but it is light-years away from many of America’s cultural influencers who live there, and that disconnect made it difficult for most of those analysts to crack the code on the Red-Blooded and Blue-Collared voters.“They were not able to understand that you didn’t have to work in a factory or a coal mine to identify with the sentiments of that worker, it was part of your legacy, your heritage, if you grew up here. So you would see someone who spent their whole life in a factory and a young person who was college-educated and doing okay sharing the same sentiments about how the system needed an overhaul,” Harry says.In 2008, Barack Obama beat Republican nominee Senator John McCain of Arizona by 9 percentage points in this county; he beat Mitt Romney in 2012 by 5 points.Four years later, Trump crushed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in Luzerne by a whopping 20-point margin. Not since Ronald Reagan had Luzerne County voted for a Republican for president by any margin, much less a runaway. More important, Trump’s 26,237-vote edge in Luzerne alone accounted for nearly 60 percent of his margin statewide in the Keystone State. He had similar rock-star status in the Pennsylvania primary in Luzerne County, racking up 77 percent of the local vote over Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasich, compared to 57 percent statewide.The state and federal governments are the top two employers here now. The third largest is perhaps the best metaphor for the new economy in which Luzerne County struggles to find its place. It’s the Internet giant Amazon.com, which has a monstrous fulfillment center in Pittston Township, where the average annual salary for warehouse work is $27,040, well below the standard of living paid by the smokestack jobs it replaced.“That salary makes it difficult to support a family, people start losing hope, especially people who aren’t book-smart but excel at working with their hands. We just don’t have room for them anymore,” Harry says. “We have cut them out.”Harry saw the rise of discontent years ago. “This did not happen overnight, people just didn’t wake up on election night and say, ‘I am going to do something different,’ ” he says.“And this did not end on election night either. I would argue that the election of Donald Trump wasn’t about him, but about those of us who want something more from Washington. Maybe we just wanted to shake things up. Maybe we wanted to send a message. Maybe it was a lot of both,” he says.Unlike the 3,832 Democrats in Luzerne County who changed their party registration to Republican, ostensibly so they could vote in the closed 2016 Republican primary, Harry did not. He didn’t formally leave his party at the beginning of the election—but his eye did wander.At the diner, Harry dusts the crumbs from his white toast off of his deep-navy Penn State sweatshirt and switches from coffee to pop. As the young utility workers at the next table leave, he tips his hat, and they return the gesture.“I made a promise to myself, four years out, after Obama won his second term, that I would never vote for a Bush or a Clinton. That was absolute. Nothing would ever change that. I thought they were both corrupt,” he says of the former Democratic nominee and Jeb Bush, son and brother of a former U.S. president.“When Trump first announced, I laughed. I just couldn’t believe that he even had a chance,” he says, but Harry was dead set on someone outside of the establishment so he started to look at the other choices.“The only other nonpolitician was Dr. Ben Carson. Everybody else, outside of [Kentucky senator] Rand Paul, I didn’t really have any use for. Put them in a bag and shake them and they all come out the same.”As the campaign went on he wasn’t committed to anybody. “The one I liked the best was Jim Webb,” Harry says of the Democratic ex-senator from Virginia and former secretary of the navy, “and I thought he was probably the best candidate out of everybody, but he didn’t last except for a couple of months.”The more he listened as the campaign went on, he explains, the better he understood that the Democrats definitely hated Trump, and the Republican establishment hated Trump. All the lobbyists on K Street hated Trump. The Chinese came out against him. India came out against him. Mexico came out against him.“I figured I must have a candidate, because everybody who’s coming out against him are all corrupt, and he’s an outsider. So, I said, ‘I think I found my candidate,’” says Harry.Then he made the announcement. “I had decided to go to the rally he held here in Wilkes-Barre and I ran into a local radio reporter who knew me as a Democrat union official. She said, ‘What are you doing here?’ I said, ‘I guess I saw the light. I’m going to support Trump.’ She said, ‘You want to get interviewed?’”He told her bluntly, “Actually, I don’t care.”During the course of the interview she asked him if he was involved in the labor community in the area.“I said, ‘I just happen to be president of the labor council.’ When we got done, I said, ‘Well, that should get me a resignation tomorrow.’ Sure enough, I got a phone call from them the next day,” he says. He voluntarily resigned, and he did it in person, in front of the entire council.Harry has lost trust in everything big in this country. “Big banks, big Wall Street, big corporations, the establishment of both parties and their lobbyists, and the big media corporations; gone are the days of the network news just delivering the news,” he says.“This Russian shit day-in and day-out is just absolute nonsense, as far as him being in cahoots. I watched ABC last Thursday; the first ten minutes dealt with nothing but the allegations that he was in bed with the Russians. The big storms that hit the Midwest got a minute. Nothing else got any time. It was just all this bullshit.”Harry is optimistic about Trump. “But it is going to be a hard slog, he has to work against the Democrats and the Republicans.“In his heart I know he wants to do well. But Washington’s culture is so embedded that it may be a year before he gets a handle, or 18 months before he gets a handle on everything,” he says.And no, he does not care about what Trump tweets. “We knew exactly who he was when we voted for him, tweet and all.”Harry is looking forward to watching Trump negotiate and spar with Washington. He’d like to see him bring them to their knees, but is realistic. “I used to hate to negotiate labor contracts,” Harry admits. “Absolutely worst job in the world. Time-consuming, petty, you had to play games, it’s a tough thing to do, and you’ve got a responsibility for everybody you represent to do the best you could, and you got to be good to the employers because you don’t want them to go out of business,” he says.“It’s a fine line that you walk, and you had to be conscious of all of that. I think he’s learning that right now, because what he was used to doing as a CEO, and he can’t do that now.“What I liked about Trump was that it was more than about Trump, it was about people, it was about being part of something bigger than just me, I felt as though I was part of something important and worthy of accomplishing something better than what we have had,” Harry says.As long as Trump stays away from becoming a Bush or a Clinton and stays tough, Harry is in for the long haul with this new alliance. “If he becomes one of them, then I think this movement continues, without him.”Adapted from The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics.

 {'title': 'Kirsten Gillibrand, Please Cut That Lame ‘Lehman Sisters’ Joke From the Stump Speech',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "If you’re not currently 100 percent sold on the president’s re-election—and odds are you’re not—then you’ve got to be hoping and praying the Democratic Party will serve up some good stuff. Instead, one of their brightest stars speaking at a big liberal conference this week seems to have gotten a ton of attention for a joke that involved the political trifecta of #fail: Not funny, pandering, and making the joke-teller look stupider than she probably is.The culprit was Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand—Hillary Clinton’s replacement in the U.S. Senate, and a Democrat who quite a few politically savvy Republican women have been looking to as the Democratic Party’s best hope for earning their votes in 2020. The joke in question was this: “If it wasn’t Lehman Brothers but Lehman Sisters we might not have had the financial collapse.” Cue the mass eyerolling and inevitable negative comparisons to her senatorial predecessor.Political humor is hard, maybe especially for women, who have to pull off “serious” without seeming “shrill.” Still, the joke—such as it was—is deserving of a critical dissection so its deliverer really gets why it shouldn’t be replicated and never uses it again.Let’s start with the obvious point that the gender of the founders of an individual financial firm cannot be said to have any sort of causal link with the things that actually caused the financial collapse: Overleveraging by individual borrowers who did not repay their mortgages on the terms originally envisaged, thus making them less profitable overall to the holders of the debt; stupid securitizations of said wrongly-valued debt that masked risk by shuffling and repooling underlying assets to achieve better ratings; and over-investment in risky assets by lots of people, including women and people whose assets were managed by women.Let’s add to that that in the run-up to Lehman going south, it actually had a prominent woman in a prominent position: Erin Callan, its CFO.Let’s further add that the financial crisis was not purely the fault of Lehman Brothers or the result of just Lehman Brothers’ actions; the reason we talk about a failure of the financial system was that it was, well, a systemic failure. And let’s remember that Gillibrand represents the state that’s home to Wall Street, and was originally a lawyer at two major Manhattan law firms. Ergo, she either thinks you’re stupid, or she’s significantly less bright than she wants you to believe. Either way, it’s a bad look.“Ever eavesdrop on the conversations of a bunch of girlfriends sipping cocktails at your local bar?”Presumably what Gillibrand was actually trying to get at was this: Voluminous studies indicate that women are more collaborative, less competitive and mean and nasty than men. The world of high finance is rightly perceived as cutthroat, slash-and-burn, very much not collaborative, and extremely male. Gillibrand was probably trying to bring onside Hillary Clinton supporters who relish 90s-era, Spice Girls-esque rhetorical “Girl Power” flourishes, while making the point that if women ran the show, capitalism would be less bloodthirsty.But one problem with this is we have no way to test the hypothesis. Another is, it doesn’t pass the smell test for a lot of women, who were presumably the ones Gillibrand was trying to win over with the joke. Ever eavesdrop on the conversations of a bunch of girlfriends sipping cocktails at your local bar? There’s good money to be had in placing a bet that they were talking smack about other women’s wrinkles, muffin tops, cankles, handbags, shoes, husbands, cars, children, dogs—and everything else. Whatever social science studies show, the truth is, women are not all that nice to women; in everyday conversation, we’re as ruthless about mere appearances as a bunch of male (and female) Wall Street execs are about money. Maybe if women were running the financial system and it biggest players, things would be somehow different. But that’s no guarantee things would be better, by any measure, except perhaps in reduced volumes of sexual harassment. That’s not unimportant, but it doesn’t speak to the volume of unaffordable balloon mortgages marketed to non-creditworthy strippers in Las Vegas, or the willingness of financial megalodons to package them all together, get a AAA rating slapped on them and market them all over the place, and then wait for the underlying assets to prove much less valuable than expected, and mass failure to ensue. Gillibrand knows this, and next time, if she wants to call out Wall Street culture, she should just do it directly by making a philosophical argument for more regulation to restrain behavior she believes can be checked by government and would have prevented the financial collapse. She can also throw in a dose of, “Hey, let’s get more women into boardrooms, too, so the financial sector isn’t dominated by people who think a good pickup tactic is slapping your dick on an uninterested co-worker’s desk at a.m.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Al Franken with regard to #metoo infractions, because of her work to change the rules governing the treatment of military sexual assault, and because of her moderate record from back when she was a congresswoman. Leave the “the world would be awesome if women ran everything” shout-outs to someone else who can’t get, and then sacrifice, crossover votes. Make your mark by being obviously smart and well-informed; not with lame jokes that make you sound dumb or patronizing. You can do better, and a lot of members of the sisterhood on the other side of the aisle seem to be banking on it these days."},
 {'title': 'The Mueller Questions for Trump Inch Us Closer to the Republic’s Fateful Day',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "So what are we to make of the 48 questions Robert Mueller wants to ask Donald Trump, as revealed last night by The New York Times? Two things.One: From this list, it appears that Mueller is for now mostly interested in whether Trump obstructed justice. The questions, especially the 18 questions that are related to James Comey, lay out the contradictions of Trump’s statements in a clear and comprehensive manner.Two: In addition, there are 13 questions about collusion and coordination with Russia. Some are awfully general, like “When did you become aware of the Trump Tower meeting?”—that is, the meeting involving Donald Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The open-ended nature of these questions in particular may be designed just to let Trump talk and trip up.On the first point, reading through the questions, it’s hard to see how Trump dances away from obstruction. There are a few different versions of “Why did you fire Comey?”—asking, for example, about the interview with Lester Holt on NBC, in which Trump admitted that he fired the FBI director over Russia. “What did you mean” in the Holt interview, the question is phrased. This may be an invitation for Trump to say, “Hey, I was kidding!”—or an invitation for the president to contradict himself.There are three or four questions that can be interpreted as being about conversations Trump had with Comey and other FBI officials to try to get them to back off Michael Flynn and the campaign more generally. Again, these read like attempts to get Trump on the record on questions related to obstruction of justice.On the second point, about collusion, the questions seem to suggest that Mueller has less to go on. For example, there is not a question that really drills down into what happened that day on Air Force One in July 2017, when Trump and aides discussed the 2016 Trump Tower meeting and the president dictated his son’s statement. That’s an odd omission, as it would seem to be a key event.It’s hard to tell what it means. It could mean Mueller doesn’t have much on that. And it could mean Mueller has the goods on it, but doesn’t want that known yet. That is, Mueller and his team surely knew that this list would be leaked immediately, so one would have to bet that Mueller knows more than these questions reveal and just wanted certain things out and is holding certain other things back.How will Trump react to this list? He blasted out a few tweets about it Tuesday morning, trying to downplay it and of course lying (“No questions on Collusion”). Given the false bravado that has gotten him through life so far, he’s bound to look at the questions and think “This will be easy.” That may be another little psychological game team Mueller is playing here: Make the public questions vague and open-ended so Trump will think he can handle being questioned under oath.But given that the guy is constantly plunging himself deeper into the quicksand with his loose talk—like his apparently accidental admission last week on Fox & Friends that Michael Cohen was indeed his lawyer on the Stormy Daniels matter—there’s every chance that if he has to sit for several hours of grilling by experienced prosecutors he’ll blurt out something self-incriminating without even knowing it.There are two questions that loom as we go forward. The first is, can Trump be compelled to testify under oath? The short answer is yes. He might invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the question of whether a president can invoke the Fifth on a criminal matter against him, because no president has tried it before.But if anyone would, of course, Trump would. Then our eyes would turn to the Supreme Court. In the past, the court has twice ruled against presidents in somewhat similar situations—it made Richard Nixon turn over his tape recordings, and it ruled that Bill Clinton was not above the law in the Paula Jones matter. So it seems possible and even likely that someday, it will be up to the Supreme Court to decide whether to compel Trump to testify. Would the five conservatives really hold that Trump’s Fifth Amendment rights are greater than the clear public interest in obtaining a president’s sworn testimony on a criminal matter involving him?And question two: What can be done if Trump just lies his head off? Or, assuming the court would hypothetically compel him to testify, he barricades himself in Mar-a-Lago and refuses to show up? If he shows up and lies, well, maybe Mueller can prove that he’s lying—but he would have to prove it not to the satisfaction of a jury, but to the satisfaction of Republicans in Congress, who would be the only people with the power to punish a lying president. Good luck with that.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

It brings that fateful day closer, and if you’re not nervous about that day, you’re not much of a citizen."},
 {'title': 'Gina Haspel Stonewalls on Discussing Her Role in CIA Torture',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) implored Gina Haspel to talk “seriously” about her long-hidden role in CIA torture and what she would do if torture enthusiast Donald Trump asked to return the agency to brutality. “My vote on your confirmation will be greatly influenced by how you address these questions today,” the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee said Wednesday morning. It spoke to the central question confronting Trump’s choice to lead the CIA: Does Haspel’s still-obscure involvement in torture disqualify her?In what might foreshadow her directorship, Haspel issued a rote pledge not to “restart a detention and interrogation program”—conspicuously saying nothing about rendering people for others to torture. She told senators she didn’t think Trump would ask her to torture anyone (even though he’s said he wanted to bring back interrogation techniques that are “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding”). And she assured her questioners that she wouldn’t act immorally even if, once again, she had legal cover. Then she dodged or obscured any substantive perspective on the morality of the agency’s shuttered torture program and, especially, her role in it. Haspel did so, over two hours, by washing herself and the CIA she has long served in the rhetorical blood of the 9/11 attacks. And she did so to such effect that she ended the hearing with indignation over a different senator’s question about her reaction should a CIA officer be waterboarded. It was not the only time Haspel’s ire soared before the committee. It soared in a manner long familiar to those who have heard CIA officials lose patience when asked about their roles in torturing at least 119 men—through bombarding them with noise and cold; keeping them awake by suspending their arms above their head for long periods; “feeding” them through forced anal penetration; and, for three people, simulating the experience of drowning, an act known as waterboarding. “Let me say this about myself,” Haspel told Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden, who opposes her nomination, “After 9/11, I didn’t look to go sit on the Swiss desk. I stepped up. I was not on the sidelines. I was on the frontlines in the Cold War, and I was on the frontlines in the fight against al-Qaeda. I am very proud of the fact that we captured the perpetrator of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. I think we did extraordinary work. To me, the tragedy is that the controversy surrounding the interrogation program—which, as I’ve already indicated to Senator Warner, I fully understand that—but it has cast a shadow over what has been a major contribution to protecting this country.” That came after Wyden asked Haspel, in a manner suggesting he knows the answer, whether she had pressed internally to revive or expand the torture program during 2005-2007, a period when it was less operationally intense than at its outset. Haspel, for neither the first nor the last time in the hearing, did not answer the question.Haspel, from October to early December 2002, ran a CIA black site in Thailand where, while she supervised it, interrogators tortured Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri—“immediately upon his arrival,” according to the CIA inspector general. Former top CIA lawyer John Rizzo, in a 2014 memoir penned before it was at all controversial, wrote that Haspel, as of 2005, had “previously run the interrogation program,” only to retract that statement after The Daily Beast called attention to it (and after he himself had reaffirmed his confidence in it). Haspel, reacting to that, twice told senators: “I did not run the interrogation department. In fact, I was not even read into the interrogation program until it had been up and running for a year.” It was a curious and precise formulation, not least of which because there has never been known to be any entity inside the CIA called “the interrogation department.”“The CIA has a serious, pervasive and corrosive accountability problem,” said Dan Jones, a former FBI counterterrorism analyst, the lead investigator for the Senate torture report and the resultant subject of CIA spying. “No one is ever sanctioned for wrongdoing, even when the CIA itself acknowledges gross misconduct.” Haspel’s defiant tone crescendoed as the hearing persisted. In written answers to the committee about her time at the CIA Counterterrorism Center, which operated the torture program, Haspel would not give any public response beyond saying she was a Deputy Group Chief from 2001-2003 and later a Senior-Level Supervisor from 2003-2004—without saying what her responsibilities were (PDF). (It was during that time that she ran the black site.) Asked by Maine independent Angus King if she was ever in a “supervisory” or “management” position over the torture program, Haspel said, “we’ll be able to go over any of my classified assignments in classified session.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who spearheaded the Senate’s landmark torture investigation, and to whom many Democrats will look to as they consider Haspel’s nomination, asked her about “overseeing the interrogation of al-Nashiri.”“Senator, anything about my classified assignment history throughout my 33 years, we can talk about in this afternoon’s closed session,” Haspel said, saying she is bound by “classification guidelines” even as she serves as acting CIA director and is herself involved in declassifying the portions of her history. (Wyden said those declassifications were “designed to get you confirmed.”) Where Haspel was more forthcoming, she also blurred critical distinctions. Discussing the November 2005 episode in which she drafted a memo for her then-boss, Jose Rodriguez, ordering the destruction of 92 torture videotapes from the Thailand black site, Haspel said she had run it by “CIA lawyers” and was aware “there was disagreement on the tapes outside the agency.”But there was disagreement within the CIA as well. Rizzo, who was a senior CIA lawyer at the time, had expressed years of reservations about the tapes’ destruction, and his and others’ slow-walking was the reason Rodriguez, aided by Haspel, sought to trash the tapes. Rodriguez writes in his own memoir that the lawyers Haspel consulted were the Counterterrorism Center attorneys—those representing the part of CIA that ran the torture program—not Rizzo’s in the Office of General Counsel. Haspel also gave a less than definitive answer when asked if any “tapes of interrogation” haven’t been destroyed. “Senator, probably, I don’t know. I don’t know if there are any other tapes. I don’t believe there are any other tapes associated with the particular interrogation activity that was on the 92 tapes, but I simply don’t know if there are any other videotapes of any other activity,” she said. Last week, The Daily Beast reported that a CIA analyst was told by a colleague that some of the torture tapes survived.While Haspel said at the start of the hearing that she wouldn’t permit the CIA to undertake “immoral” activity, and assured that her “moral compass is strong,” she ducked senator after senator who invited her to make a moral judgment about torture.To West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, Haspel argued the CIA ought not return to interrogation because the agency hasn’t historically done it. To California Democrat Kamala Harris, she repeatedly refused to answer, instead praising the CIA’s “extraordinary work” and saying that now she accepts a “higher moral standard.” That was the same answer she gave Warner, which Warner called “legalistic.” When Martin Heinrich of New Mexico asked where her conscience was during the torture program, she ultimately answered with a reference to her parents raising her the right way.Republicans, with the exception of Maine’s Susan Collins, were less interested in the question. Chairman Richard Burr, an opponent of the Senate torture report, said at the outset he supports Haspel, who has “acted morally, ethically and legally over a 30-year career.” Florida’s Marco Rubio referred to Haspel being “smeared” by the torture questioning. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, himself floated as a possible Trump CIA director, accused Democrats of hypocrisy in supporting Obama CIA Director John Brennan, whom Haspel quickly affirmed was the CIA’s fourth most senior leader after 9/11 (and whom has similarly refused to address his involvement in torture). As Haspel gained more full-throated support from Republicans and deflected the Democrats, she felt emboldened enough to take umbrage at the torture questioning itself. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said she “suggested that [torture] was good tradecraft” and asked if it would be moral if one of her officers “was captured and subjected to waterboarding and enhanced interrogation techniques which you, I believe, supervised.”“Senator, I don’t believe the terrorists follow any guidelines or civilized norms or the law. CIA follows the law,” Haspel said.“Excuse me, madam. You seem to be saying that you were not following civilized norms and the law when you were conducting those self same activities, if that’s the analogy you’re going to draw,” Reed said. “A civilized nation was doing it, until it was outlawed by this Congress.” (Torture was illegal before 9/11, though the Justice Department wrote a much-derided and ultimately retracted opinion blessing the CIA’s torture program.) “Senator, I would never, obviously, support inhumane treatment of any CIA officers,” she said. “Khalid Sheikh Mohammed personally killed a Wall Street Journal correspondent and filmed that. I don’t think there’s any comparison between CIA officers serving their country, adhering to U.S. law, and terrorists who by their very definition are not following anybody’s law.” Performances like that help explain Haspel’s extremely deep support within the CIA, as demonstrated by several open letters from agency veterans (PDF). Haspel is as CIA as it gets: a 33-year operations officer, not an analyst, who would be the first such individual to lead the agency since the Church and Pike Commissions reined in the agency in the 1970s. She framed her recent opposition to torture in terms of “risk” to the CIA itself, not in terms of harm to its captives—one of whom died, while another was punched in the abdomen while pregnant. Her combination of obfuscation, defiance, and explicit invocation of 9/11 to shut down torture questions echoed Brennan’s own response to the Senate torture report—which she referred to as the “SSCI Majority Report,” the language agency veterans and Republicans use when they want to dismiss it as shallow and partisan. And she echoed the CIA’s recent stance that it’s “unknowable” whether the torture the agency once portrayed as necessary actually worked, a position it adopted once agnosticism became more politically useful than endorsement. Haspel entered the hearing with doubts about whether she wanted the directorship enough to subject herself to a grueling inquest into her background. She reportedly talked about dropping out as recently as late last week until the White House pledged full support. But Haspel left the hearing with no doubt that she wants to run Langley—and did so while sparing herself any substantive public investigation. For good measure, in a nod to her new relationship with Trump, Haspel dismissed as a “hypothetical” questions about Trump asking the same personal loyalty of her that he asked of ex-FBI Director James Comey; declined to say she would inform Congress if he does; and said Trump, who has compared the CIA to Nazis, has shown the agency “enormous respect.” Feinstein and Warner, critical Democratic votes in a Senate where Democratic support will determine her directorship, said after the public hearing they were undecided on Haspel. Manchin, whom Haspel physically embraced ahead of the hearing and whom Trump has recently attacked, said she had his vote. “Confirming her,” said Jones, the lead torture-report investigator, “would send a terrible message to the CIA workforce, our citizens and the world. There has to be some level of accountability—or this, or something like it, will happen again.” —with additional reporting by Andrew Desiderio"},
 {'title': 'Stormy Daniels Wants to Sell You a Trump-Spanking Souvenir',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Are fake boobs better than fake news?That’s the message Stormy Daniels is trying to send with her new online shop, which she’s running with the help of some friends—namely, her “two gay dads.”“Her whole thing is … if I’m going to be in this situation, let’s have a little fun with it and take control of the message,” said J.D. Barrale, who is married to Daniels’ photographer and longtime pal Keith Munyan. The site is peddling anti-bullying wristbands and #TeamStormy tees. Two designs take aim at President Trump and his attorney, Michael Cohen, whom Daniels is suing to void a “hush agreement” inked weeks before the 2016 election. (Cohen is also embroiled in a high-profile criminal probe over the payout.) In one image, the porn star bends over a copy of Forbes with the words “Don’t make me spank you”—in homage to the apocryphal anecdote about Daniels whipping Trump’s behind with the magazine. (She actually allegedly paddled him with an edition of Trump.)Another design is a tabloid cover of The Stormy Times. Daniels is pictured gripping her assets and smiling for the headline, “Fake Boobs > Fake news.” In the right-hand corner are lucky numbers for a $130,000 jackpot—a cheeky reference to what Cohen paid Daniels for her silence on the Trump affair.“I made it ‘The Stormy Times’. I sent it to her and she said she just about peed her pants,” Munyan told The Daily Beast of his pet project with Daniels, as he filled T-shirt orders on Monday evening. “She thought it was the funniest thing ever.”As The Daily Beast reported, Munyan was one of four people listed in Daniels’ hush agreement as having knowledge about her 2006 affair with Trump. (While Daniels’ former attorney and former manager are cooperating with the FBI probe into Cohen, Munyan says the feds haven’t contacted him.)Munyan, who met Daniels on a photo shoot, said she would put Trump on speakerphone when he’d ring her in 2006 and 2007. Trump “would call all the time,” Munyan previously told The Daily Beast. “That man can talk about nothing for hours.”The fashion photographer snapped Daniels for her Penthouse issue, which hit newsstands today with a nude spread of the actress.Daniels hatched the Stormy Store during a recent visit with Munyan and Barrale, who live on a horse ranch in California and count Daniels as their family. The three sat around a kitchen table, talking and laughing, when the Stormy Store was born. Munyan says Daniels needed a website; her suitcases full of merchandise for her Make America Horny Again tour were getting too heavy.

We’re really worried about her,” Munyan told The Daily Beast.“She has two bodyguards. She has a team traveling with her all the time now,” he added.Munyan and Barrale said a percentage of the Stormy Store’s proceeds will go to anti-bullying nonprofits. One of Daniels’ offerings is a wristband etched with “Fighting bullies is kind of my thing” on the inside and “Team Stormy” on the outside.Still, the couple says their best-seller is “#TeamStormy” in rainbow lettering. “I think for gay pride we’re gonna be a hit,” Barrale said. Munyan chimed in, “She warned us about this. She already told me, ‘We’ve got to do the rainbow.’” (They’re also plotting a display at Chi Chi LaRue’s, a West Hollywood adult boutique.)“It shows some humor amid all the stress of this,” Barrale said, referring to the daily installments of the Stormy spectacle vexing Trumpland. “Stormy has struck a nerve.”“I think the Republicans thought, ‘Who is this woman?’ and that this will just blow over because of who she is,” Barrale added. “She’s become a folk hero in a way.”Daniels has appeared in court, on ABC’s The View, and even made a cameo on NBC’s Saturday Night Live in her dogged pursuit of Trump and his loyal fixer. “Just tell me, what do you need for this to all go away?” asked Alec Baldwin, playing the president on SNL last weekend. Daniels, to applause, retorted, “A resignation?”“We are proud of her, very proud of her,” Munyan said. “I thought what she wrote to Roseanne Barr was priceless,” Barrale said, referring to her Twitter feud over a NSFW topic.“For the Americans who need hope and something to laugh about during dark and troubled times, I hope we’re helping you all out in this process,” Barrale added.Daniels isn’t going away, her dads say. “Do you want your leader to be someone who’s a continuous liar?’” Barrale said. “It’s very obvious she’s caught him in an enormous lie. It’s like gum that’s stuck to a shoe. You just can’t seem to get rid of it.”"},
 {'title': 'The Inhuman Human Toll of Trump’s Muslim Ban',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments as it decides the constitutionality of Trump’s Muslim ban 3.0. And yes, it’s a Muslim ban, even though not all Muslims are banned. It’s hilarious to see the right wingers who despise political correctness being p.c. when it comes to this ban designed to be step one in keeping Muslims out of America. And to be clear, all three executive orders Trump has signed attempting to implement a ban on Muslims spring from the same place. That, of course, was Trump’s proclamation on December 8, 2015 during the heart of the campaign, when he told his cheering fans: “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”Trump’s call to ban over a billion people from America simply because of their religious faith—a sentiment as revolting today as when Trump first called for it – overjoyed the GOP base. Remember, just two months before that, fellow GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson had remarked that a Muslim American should not be president of the United States. The response was swift: Carson jumped in the GOP polls and saw a fundraising boon, telling the media, “The money has been coming in so fast, it\'s hard to even keep up with it," as he raised $1 million in the next 24 hours.That was not lost on Trump, who commented a few weeks later about Carson’s anti-Muslim remarks: “He’s been getting a lot of ink on the Muslims and other things,” adding, “And I guess people look at that and they probably like it. Some people thought they wouldn’t like it, but they probably do.”That history makes it crystal clear that Trump’s Muslim ban was designed to give a GOP base hungry to hate some blood-red meat. Trump’s Muslim bashing didn’t stop with campaign rhetoric such as his claim that “Islam hates us.” As President, Trump retweeted three horrific anti-Muslim videos this past November that were created by a notorious anti-Muslim hate group and were designed expressly to gin up hate of Muslims. “55 former officials from Republican and Democratic administrations, including CIA directors and counterterrorism chiefs have condemned Trump’s Muslim ban as “counterproductive and antithetical to American values.””Thankfully, the federal courts that have considered Trump’s three executive orders have also taken into account Trump’s history of anti-Muslim hate—and so they should. Federal courts in the past have considered the intention of legislators when reviewing a law that might be neutral on its face but was drafted with discriminatory intent. We saw an example of that in 2016 when a federal appeals court struck down a GOP-enacted voter ID law in North Carolina noting that it had been drafted deliberately to\xa0“target African-Americans with almost surgical precision”\xa0with the goal being to disenfranchise them. Consequently, the first two Muslim bans were effectively put on hold by the federal courts in large part due to Trump’s track record of anti-Muslim animus.Hopefully, a majority of the Supreme Court justices will do the same as they decide this case which focuses on Trump’s ban 3.0 that focuses on eight countries: Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen. This Muslim ban 3.0 was signed by Trump in September 2017 and added North Korea and Venezuela to the list of countries in an effort to pretend this wasn’t a Muslim ban. But as the ACLU has accurately pointed out, only 61 people from North Korea even received a visa last year to the United States, and the ban regarding Venezuela doesn’t apply to the country as a whole, rather only to certain government officials.Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Muslim ban to take effect in December 2017 while this case was on appeal, impacting countless people who were banned from coming to the United States for educational purposes, to visit sick family members or even reunite with spouses and children. If the Supreme Court upholds this Muslim ban, there’s little doubt he will try to expand it to more Muslim-majority countries.And let’s be clear: The claim that this Muslim ban is about securing our nation is a charade intended to mask bigotry. That point was made emphatically by 55 former officials from Republican and Democratic administrations, including CIA directors and counterterrorism chiefs, who have condemned Trump’s Muslim ban as “counterproductive and antithetical to American values.”Add to that, in a friend of the court brief submitted to the Supreme Court in opposition to Trump’s Muslim ban, nearly 30 retired generals and admirals made it clear that the ban actually makes us less safe as well as jeopardizes our troops, because it undermines efforts to build local allies in the Middle East and helps ISIS recruit. The effect of Trump’s attempted Muslim bans, however, extend beyond the Muslim countries Trump has targeted. We’ve seen the impact right here on our soil in the form of a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes over the past year. As documented by the Council on American Islamic Relations in a report released Monday, in 2017 there was “a 17 percent increase in anti-Muslim bias incidents and a 15 percent increase in hate crimes in 2017 over the previous year.” As CAIR’s Research and Advocacy Coordinator Zainab Arain commented, its study has found that Trump’s “unconstitutional Muslim Ban resulted in\xa0more\xa0Islamophobic hate\xa0and violence." Add to that, this fiscal year the Trump administration is on track to the accept the smallest number of refuges since the 1980 law was enacted that created our nation’s modern resettlement program. In actual numbers that translates into Trump accepting 21,000 refugees, roughly a quarter of the number accepted during the last year of the Obama administration.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.And with regard to refugees, only about 15 percent are Muslim, down from 47 percent a year ago. This again is consistent with Trump’s campaign promise to prioritize Christian refugees while closing the doors on Muslims in need of help simply because of their faith. Trump is the most openly anti-Muslim person to serve as president as evidenced from his rhetoric to his Muslim ban to closing the door on Muslim refugees. Changing Trump or the bigotry of the GOP base is likely impossible. The best hope, though, is that the U.S. Supreme Court will at least prevent Trump from turning his bigotry into policy by striking down Trump’s Muslim ban 3.0. '},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen Once Called Trump the ‘Godfather of Politics’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'James Comey isn’t the only person to compare Donald Trump to a crime boss. In 2011, Michael Cohen called Trump the “godfather of politics,” foreshadowing language the fired FBI director recently used to describe the president. “He is now the godfather of politics,” Cohen, Trump’s longtime personal attorney, told ABC News in 2011. “Everybody wants to see him, everybody wants his endorsement.” Later in the interview, Cohen boasted that whomever Trump endorsed would be the 2012 Republican nominee. “These people will follow him to wherever he goes, hence of course why again I said he’s become now the godfather of politics,” Cohen said later in the interview.“You like that!” he interjected when host Amy Walters started asking a follow-up question. “You like that term, I can see it!” “I mean, it’s—it’s really good, using the godfather, OK,” she replied. Comey has now drawn Trump’s ire for making a similar comparison. In an interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday, Comey compared Trump to a mob boss. “How strange is it for you to sit here and compare the president to a mob boss?” interviewer George Stephanopoulos asked Comey. “Very strange,” Comey replied. “And I don’t do it lightly. I—and I’m not trying to that, by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and—you know, shaking down shopkeepers. But instead, what I’m talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration.” The organized crime analogies may have started with Cohen—and they may end with him, too. White House allies told The Daily Beast that the raid on his office was the kind of tactic law enforcement would usually be expected to use against the Mafia. '},
 {'title': 'Not Much Passes the 100-Year Test. Will Trump?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Trump era news cycle moves fast. As we try to separate the urgent from the important, it’s worth asking who and what will really be remembered a century from now. It’s not likely to be what you’d expect. For the past few years, I’ve been combing through the archives of the New York Times Sunday magazine for my website SundayMagazine.org. And what I’ve found is that even the biggest news of the time quickly fades.The 100-year test is much different than the half-century test. After 50 years, tens of millions of people are still alive. After 100 years, the living witnesses are gone.So let’s examine who and what from around 1918 is—and isn’t—still widely remembered in 2018. Those findings can help us make informed guesses about who and what from 2018 might still be remembered in 2118.In early 1918, World War I was still raging and writing at the time explicitly suggested that President Woodrow Wilson would join George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in the ranks of America’s most legendary presidents—the three leaders who had commanded during the nation’s biggest military conflicts up to that point.But a 2009 study asking respondents to name as many presidents as they could found that fewer than half of respondents could remember Wilson. Indeed, WWI probably ranks as only the third-most remembered American military conflict of the 20th century, behind WWII and Vietnam. Since last summer, younger Americans might primarily think of WWI as the war that Wonder Woman fought.What about cultural icons? The three highest paid and most popular movie stars at the time were Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks. Only Chaplin is still remembered today by anybody other than silent film buffs. The two most popular sports were baseball and boxing, with basketball and football a distant second tier. The 10 most popular songs of 1918 are virtually unheard of today, including “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody”; “Hello Central! Give Me No Man’s Land”; and “Just a Baby’s Prayer at Twilight.”So, the $64,000 question is who and what from now will still be remembered in a century. The answer is probably much less than we think. That’s thanks to a potent psychological bias known as the availability heuristic, in which people have a tendency to rely on examples that come quickly and easily to mind when evaluating a topic. To prove my point, the phrase “the $64,000 question” is a reference to the most viewed television show of 1956, which is largely forgotten today.Let’s go look at a few of the top contenders.September 11 is the obvious top contender. But 2016 was the first election featuring voters with no memory of that day—which will only be increasingly common in 2020 and beyond. As some commentators were already writing a few years ago, “the 9/11 era is over.”In no way do I mean to minimize the tragedy of September 11. The tragic 1915 sinking of the Lusitania by Germany caused 1,198 deaths and helped galvanize the American public into World War I, just as 9/11 led to our military interventions in Afghanistan and (much more controversially) Iraq. But the Lusitania is not widely remembered today by the general public. Perhaps it would have fared better if James Cameron had made a movie about star-crossed lovers on that ship instead.Another applicable analogy here might be the Kennedy assassination. But if we assume a minimum age of five to form a clear memory, only about 21 percent of Americans still remember the Kennedy assassination from their own experience—and that was just 55 years ago.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“But everybody still knows the Kennedy assassination,” comes the natural retort. Fair point. But again, the 100-year test is quite different from the 50-year test. After a century, will September 11 or Kennedy’s assassination be better remembered than those of Presidents James Garfield and William McKinley are today? Everyone alive in 1881 and 1901 remembered where they were when they heard the news, too. Today’s tech icons and inventors might fare better. \xa0After all, computers, the internet, and smartphones have transformed our lives. Will Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates—the devices, services, and websites they invented—still be widely remembered in a century? Current technology will likely seem as primitive to the citizens of 2118 as the telegraphs and early radios of 1918 seem to us. Radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi boasts hardly any name recognition today. Lest one fall prey to the belief that today’s technology is fundamentally different than the telegraph or original radios, recall the infamous prediction of U.S. Patent Office Commissioner Charles Duell in 1899: “Everything that can be invented has been invented.”In fact, the phenomenon of technological outdatedness can be far more recent than even the demise of Atari and Pong in the mid-’80s. Already, the revolutionary iPod of 2002 appears on its deathbed: Apple discontinued two of the three remaining iPod models last year. But to be fair, the airplane’s and lightbulb’s primary inventors are still widely known a century later. Proof: you know who I’m referring to without my mentioning their names. Everybody still knows Henry Ford for bringing automotive travel to the masses; maybe Elon Musk will be similarly remembered for bringing them space travel.So how about today’s biggest cultural phenomena, like Harry Potter, Hamilton, and The Hunger Games?If the list of every Billboard #1 song provides any clue, they can all be forgotten. How well do you still remember “Cheerleader,” “Rude,” and “Somebody That I Used to Know”? And those all topped the charts within the past five years.Similarly, the 100 highest grossing films of all time yield many titles which today’s average moviegoer probably has never even heard of, including 1945’s The Bells of St. Mary’s, 1946’s The Best Years of Our Lives, and 1953’s The Robe.Chuck Klosterman in his recent book But What If We’re Wrong? discussed this phenomenon in regard to authors. Analyzing a 1936 Colophon magazine poll predicting which contemporary writers would be viewed as canonical in 2000, Klosterman notes that three of the top 10 were poets, of whom only one (Robert Frost) remains widely known today. Klosterman then adds, “Now, the fact that Colophon voters went only one-for-three in their poet prognostication is not what matters here; what matters is that they voted for three poets. If such a poll were taken today, it’s hard to imagine how far down the list one would have to scan before finding the name of even one. A present-day Colophon would need to create a separate category for poetry, lest it not be recognized at all.”So what about marquee athletes? After all, Babe Ruth is still remembered 100 years later. But America’s most popular sport today is football and viewership has plunged in recent years, dropping by 17 percent since 2015. Participation in youth tackle football has dropped 20 percent in the last decade, largely over concerns about concussions and permanent brain injuries. Would Tom Brady or Peyton Manning still be remembered in a hypothetical future where even football itself might barely be? Margot Robbie, nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Tonya Harding in I Tonya, thought that both Harding and her 1994 scandal were entirely fictional upon first reading the screenplay. The ice skating scandal was inescapable in 1994, but Robbie was born in 1990.Finally, let’s get to politics. The aforementioned 2009 study found the three least remembered presidents were Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester A. Arthur—each of whom, when he served, was one of the most famous and discussed people in America. Will the same fate befall Obama or Trump?Obama’s status as the first African-American president alone will likely suffice to keep his name in public memory long after he’s entirely left the stage. As of this moment, though, Trump’s long-term status seems more questionable. Some historians have posited that the president who Trump most resembles is Zachary Taylor: hugely controversial at the time, a wealthy and inexperienced political outsider who divided his party in two—and who is now almost completely forgotten.Jesse Rifkin was named one of the country’s top three best general interest columnists of 2016 by the National Society of Newspaper Columnists. He runs the website SundayMagazine.org."},
 {'title': 'Trump Administration Rule Would Keep More Undocumented Kids Apart From Their Relatives',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A proposed rule could make it much harder for undocumented immigrant children who come to the United States to stay with their relatives. Currently, when unaccompanied children arrive at the border—the bulk of whom flee violent, dangerous countries and look for asylum in the U.S.—they usually go into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS then tries to find parents or relatives who can care for them while their immigration proceedings move forward. Those people are called sponsors. And if HHS can’t find sponsors for the children, they stay in foster care or shelters. Last week, however, the Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule that would have Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) check the immigration status of sponsors looking to care for these children, as well as the immigration status of any other adults who live in the sponsors’ homes. The rule would have ICE get biometric data—potentially meaning fingerprints or retinal scans—of those individuals. Because the relatives of undocumented children are sometimes themselves undocumented, immigrant rights advocates warn that the new rule could put some potential sponsors in fear of deportation, discouraging them from coming forward to take in unaccompanied children. “The proposal has the potential to drastically expand ICE’s enforcement dragnet,” said Katie Shepherd of the American Immigration Council. “It may ultimately harm—not help—unaccompanied children whose sponsors and loved ones end up being targeted and detained by ICE due to the increased screening.” Shepherd added that children may end up languishing in foster care or HHS shelters as a result of the rule change, at a much higher cost to U.S. taxpayers. The rule, which was first reported on by PoliticoPro, can be implemented without congressional approval. Currently, DHS is hearing comments on the rule. The deadline for commenting is June 7. The rule comes in the wake of a report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that noted some children placed with sponsors in 2014 ended up being forced into difficult conditions (PDF). In one case, children ended up working on a Marion, Ohio, egg farm for 12 hours every day. Lawmakers criticized HHS officials over the report’s findings at a hearing on April 26 of this year. “Once these unaccompanied kids are in the United States, we have a duty to ensure they’re not trafficked and they’re not abused,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH). The Department of Homeland Security directed The Daily Beast to that hearing for comment on the rule change. In the hearing, acting assistant secretary at HHS’ Administration for Children and Families, Steve Wagner, spotlighted the horror of children being trafficked and said that increased information sharing between ICE and HHS is designed to protect children from exploitation. “We had a change of administration,” Wagner said. “There’s new political leadership at both departments that insists on taking a look at the situation governing UAC, precisely because of what this committee highlighted in the terrible Marion, Ohio case. We want to make sure that’s never repeated.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The effects are enormous, and it would just serve to drive people further underground and harm children in deep and permanent ways.”ICE has made a host of policy changes under the Trump administration impacting women and children. The agency ended its practice of releasing pregnant women from detention, as The Daily Beast first reported—a change some advocates say will result in more miscarriages. And last week, the Justice Department announced that when family units cross the border into the U.S., it will separate parents from their children. "},

 {'title': 'Trump Hotel to Employees: Don’t Hire Relatives',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, has presented all kinds of headaches for his White House. Forget the multiple federal investigations into the Kushner family businesses; his manifold financial interests have presented scores of potential conflicts of interest, impairing both men’s reputations and damaging the public view of Kushner’s family brand. This all would have been avoided if Trump had followed the rules governing his Las Vegas hotel, which largely bar giving top jobs to family members. We know about those rules because Property of the People, an advocacy group specializing in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation, obtained the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas employee handbook as part of a FOIA request of the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB heard a case related to allegations of union-busting at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, and Property of the People FOIA’d the hearing transcripts as well as all the exhibits that were entered. One of those exhibits—entered on Nov. 18, 2015—was the hotel’s Associate Handbook, which includes all the rules employees at the hotel had to follow. The handbook as it was entered in court is published in full below. The handbook has strong words about hiring family members. “While TIHLV [Trump International Hotel Las Vegas] does not wish to deprive itself of the services of potentially valuable Associates by establishing a policy excluding the employment of relatives, it must be acknowledged, that such employment can result in the appearance of a conflict of interest, collusion, favoritism, and other undesirable work environment conditions,” the handbook says. “Therefore, management reserves the right to limit the employment of relatives in situations within the company if a conflict of interest is deemed to exist.” The handbook bars relatives from working “under the direct or indirect supervision of a relative.” It also bars relatives from working “in situations that create the possibility of conflicts of interest,” without the written approval of senior management officials. “Prohibited activity includes ‘offensive sexual jokes, sexual language, sexual epithets, sexual gossip, sexual comments or sexual inquiries’ and unwelcome flirting.”This rule, however, clearly didn’t apply to the Trump family. The handbook includes photos of Trump himself, as well as his daughter Ivanka and his sons, Don Jr. and Eric. Don Jr. was hired by his father in 2001. Ivanka and Eric followed in 2005 and 2006, respectively. “The Freedom of Information Act exists to hold government accountable,” said Gunita Singh, a staff attorney at Property of the People. “As his hotel manual demonstrates, Donald Trump doesn’t even hold himself accountable to his own standards.”The White House directed The Daily Beast to the Trump Organization for comment on this story. Amanda Miller, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization, defended the handbook. “The policies set forth in our employment manual are both lawful and standard in the hospitality industry,” she told The Daily Beast. The handbook includes two provisions that employment attorneys said could run afoul of federal law. First, the handbook bars male employees from having visible tattoos, but with some exceptions for seasonal workers. Female employees, however, are totally barred from having visible tattoos—no exceptions.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“The tattoo rule appears to burden women seasonal workers more than male seasonal workers,” said Eve Hill, an attorney with Brown, Goldstein & Levy and a former official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “So that seems to violate the sex discrimination rules on its face.”Another issue: The handbook bans male employees (but not female employees) from having braided hair. Hill said this provision could raise concerns about racial discrimination. “Braids and dreads for African-American men are very common and not generally considered disruptive or distracting or a poor grooming habit,” Hill said. “In fact, they can be beautiful. I think if this were applied to African-American men, you could easily get a race discrimination challenge on that basis, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would seem to recognize that as potential race discrimination.”The manual also strictly prohibits harassment. It bars “epithets, slurs, quips, or negative stereotyping” related to people’s race, religion, gender, and other factors. And it bars “‘jokes,’ ‘pranks’ or other forms of ‘humor’ that are demeaning or hostile.” It includes a section specifically regarding sexual harassment that bars a host of inappropriate activity. Prohibited activity includes “[u]nwelcome or offensive sexual jokes, sexual language, sexual epithets, sexual gossip, sexual comments or sexual inquiries” and unwelcome flirting. It also bars “[s]exually suggestive or obscene comments or gestures” as well as “[n]egative statements or disparaging remarks targeted at one sex (either men or women), even if the content of the verbal abuse is not sexual in nature.”Trump’s notorious “grab ’em by the pussy” remark would have run afoul of this policy. By ABC News’ count, at least 16 women have accused the president of sexual harassment or misconduct. The allegations run the gamut: Multiple women allege the president reached his hands under women’s skirts between their legs, and one, Cathy Heller, alleges that he forcibly kissed her on the lips at his Mar-a-Lago club on Mother’s Day. Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice who says Trump pushed his genitals against her without her consent, is suing the president for defamation because he called her a liar over that allegation. During the campaign, Trump categorically denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and threatened to sue all the women who came forward. He has yet to follow through on his lawsuit threats. The Trump hotel’s employee manual specifically bars “[c]oerced sexual acts,” as well as “[t]ouching or assaulting an individual’s body, or staring, in a sexual manner.”“Beyond allowing his private corporations to unconstitutionally profit from taxpayer dollars, Donald Trump can’t even manage to follow his own company’s guidelines on sexual harassment,” Singh said. “In the White House sits a con artist and Womanizer in Chief.”Hill noted the discrepancy between Trump’s personal behavior and his company’s requirements of its employees.“It appears, as is often the case, that those rules are applied to the workers but not the leadership,” she said.

 {'title': 'Our Presidential Politics Have Always Been Nasty. President Trump Is Something New.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The negativity, hostility and incivility of the Trump presidency makes it easy to say that he, and he alone, has degraded American political discourse and this coarseness has, \xa0thereby, endangered our nation and our democracy. But saying that is to both miss the point and give him too much credit. We \xa0romanticize and misremember our past, creating a mythology that is more Hollywood than real, when we assume a golden age of civility in American political life. As most American historians know, politics has always been a competitive sport and American presidents have always expressed crude and often negative opinions about opponents. The difference between then and now is that they usually kept these thoughts and sayings private. We can hear them voice these thoughts to aides, colleagues, and staff in the White House tapes of JFK, LBJ and Nixon. But, they were careful to keep those thoughts out of the public realm (and their White House staffs rarely leaked), and to speak publicly in what could be best called a presidential voice. There was, in a sense a difference between the public and private sphere of being president.One key difference today is the erasure of the \xa0private. Everything is public, as we are all witnesses as everything is leaked, tweeted, posted and published, in more or less real time. What we are witnessing is the unveiling of an old American secret — that politics is nasty business.From the founding through much of the 19th century, ambitious men (and they were all men) used surrogates to pursue political office as the physical act of just running was seen as a demeaning, dirty act. Politics was above the American statesman. Active campaigning and embracing the active politics of life is a 20th century device, but let’s not forget that negative campaigning is age-old. The masters of politics (wizards and manipulators) always existed, if hidden behind the curtain, \xa0held at a distance and never fully in the inner circle. They were most certainly never public figures. They were feared and reviled as much as they were needed.Take the 1800 presidential election between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as an example. Supporters of Adams called Jefferson "a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father." That was in response to Jefferson’s supporters calling Adams a "hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman." Neither man publically campaigned, let alone cast such loaded terms around; they battled through proxies in the belief that politics was by its nature is ugly and petty, thatt it could soil better men. Leaders needed to insulate themselves from politics as best they could to appear as statesmen rather than mere politicians. Statesmen needed to be above politics. What we are witnessing now is the final toppling of the American \xa0statesman, as those in politics realize they are at their core politicians and therefore must embrace the realities of the business. The facade or gloss of statesmanship, of the walls between private and public life for American politicians is dead. . Sure, there are still those in politics who try to cling to the old notions, trying to stay above the fray, trying to maintain the dignity of statesmanship (in its genderless meaning). They are a declining bunch these days and seem to be going the way of the dodo bird.Let’s look at presidential communication as a case in point. \xa0Historian David Greenberg has explained the role of political communications in The Republic of Spin, his important book on presidential and political communications. Presidents and their White House staff have always tried to manipulate the message, to change the discussion and influence discourse. How else could you govern or get anything done after all? To do that effectively, presidents needed to seem to be above politics, all the while being skilled political animals. Publicly they were statesmen; privately they were Machiavellian to the core. To succeed, White Houses needed a light-touch approach, as civilized discourse and plausible deniability were the rules. To overreach was to be publicly rebuffed. Therefore, they tried to avoid the appearance of direct manipulation, the appearance of scandal or anything that might change focus away from desired policy outcomes.Sure, there are a few moments in history that pushed past the norms. The corruption of Ulysses Grant for instance, and more recently Richard Nixon and Watergate, but each of these low points led to what we might call a correction in the norms and expectations to which he held our presidents. We recommited to the statesman model of leadership.Today, our political and social norms are again being pushed and it’s not clear we’ve yet hit whatever deep new bottom. The nastiness is nothing new. The abandonment of any veneer of politeness and civility, however, is very new—and suggests that the long-established unwritten rules of American politics have now been torn up.The current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue got there by breaking all the old rules of decent discourse, and — despite his plank promises that \xa0\'I\'m gonna be so presidential that you people will be so bored” — has continued to viciously insult women, immigrants, rival politicians and anyone else who inspires his anger since coming to office. He won it by being a politician— and \xa0truly our first celebrity president, as John McCain, a subject of many of Trump’s insults, accused Barack Obama of being in 2008 — and shows no interest in becoming a statesman now. Trump understands the entertainment value of politics and seems to have approached the campaign and his presidency as he would a reality show — the nasty characters always stay the longest. The nicest contestants leave first. We are all witnesses to his utterances and will find out soon if there is any clawing back of our old political rules this time. Will one insult finally be the line in the sand that Americans will not accept him crossing? Is a moment coming similar to when chief counsel for the army Joseph N. Welsh confronted Senator Joseph McCarthy (advised by future Trump adviser Roy Cohn) with the line: "At long last, have you left no sense of decency?” and thereby loosened the grip of McCarthyism on the U.S. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'High Stakes for GOP in Vicious Primaries Being Decided on Tuesday',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In West Virginia, one Republican primary candidate has waged an all-out racist assault against the Senate leader of his own party. In Indiana, another Republican candidate has tied himself so closely to the president that he is promising to help end the special counsel’s probe. And in Ohio, an insurgent Republican threatens to let the party lose another special election in a year where the Democratic Party base is at its most energized. Tuesday’s primary votes in those contests, pitting more mainstream candidates against more radical ones, could well determine whether Republicans can hold their majorities in the House and Senate in November. The Senate primaries in Indiana and West Virginia have particularly high stakes for the GOP, presently holding on to a slim 51-49 majority. With other seats in danger, the party is hopeful the right challenger could knock off Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), a moderate in his caucus, and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) in a state where Trump remains very popular. In both states, a businessman who’s emphasized his alignment with President Trump is\xa0trying to defeat sitting members of the House. In West Virginia, that businessman is former coal executive Don Blankenship, who served time in prison for willfully violating mine safety and health standards after a 2010 mine explosion that resulted in the deaths of 29 people. Many mainstream Republicans see Blankenship as another candidate in the mold of Judge Roy Moore, who wowed primary voters only to lose an eminently winnable Senate race in Alabama last year. Like Moore, Blankenship is running against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the mainstream media and, in terms reminiscent of the president himself, the Justice Department. Blankenship’s latest batch of advertisements have taken a turn toward the absurd, with blank stares into the camera and attacks on McConnell’s “China family.” While political pros have mocked the ads, Blankenship’s incendiary approach has earned him more press attention, if much of it negative, than his opponents Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. “Hard to expect the media to avert its eyes from the Blankenship circus, particularly in a click-driven environment, but I think there is a real tail risk,” Republican strategist Liam Donovan observed. “Dominating the conversation for negative reasons is still dominating the conversation, and with just days to go that really matters. It would be naive to think that wasn’t his goal in releasing this ridiculous ad.”Most recent public polls show Blankenship in third place, as two PACs with undisclosed donors have aimed negative ads at him. Yet there’s enough concern he could win the race that the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., has pleaded with voters in recent days to reject his candidacy. “No more fumbles like Alabama,” he tweeted. “We need to win in November.”In a state where almost 70 percent of voters backed Donald Trump in 2016, Blankenship’s anti-D.C. messaging may be resonating.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“I think he’s really good at capturing media attention much the same way that President Trump was and still is,” Dr. Patrick Hickey, a political science professor at West Virginia University, told The Daily Beast. But that may not translate on the ground as Blankenship’s reputation and history precede him.“A lot of people think this rich guy sort of killed these miners out of greed,” Hickey said. In Indiana, another brutal primary is pitting Trump acolytes against each other. Rep. Luke Messer has nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize ahead of the president’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Meanwhile, Rep. Todd Rokita, recently ran an ad promising to end special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation if elected to the Senate: “Mueller, Pelosi, Donnelly. They’re using fake news to destroy our president. Who’s tough enough to stop the witch hunt?” Both are up against former state lawmaker Mike Braun, who’s offering himself as the consummate outsider in the vein of Trump, using his own money to finance the race and running ads with cardboard cut-outs of his opponents in which he asks voters if they can tell the difference between the two. Operatives watching the race think that Braun could mount a strong challenge against Donnelly but his background as an owner of a national auto parts distribution company bears some risk with the potential for more stories about his business record to emerge. And some Republicans have been dismayed at the pattern emerging in primaries across the nation where candidates are mimicking Trump and hoping for the same results. “I watched this happen in 2009-2010 when candidates came out of the woodwork trying to be Sarah Palin,” Matt Borges, former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, told The Daily Beast, describing the climate more broadly. “It didn’t work. There were no mini Palins. It’s better for candidates to be themselves and try to build their own brand, instead of trying to pretend they’re something they’re not and, in many cases, have a record showing that they’ve never been.”Borges, and other Republicans in his state, have been watching another Tuesday contest closer to home with bated breath. Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-OH) announced his retirement last year, setting the stage for an August special election in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District, which encompasses areas to the north and east of Columbus. The race has been deemed a toss-up by the Cook Political Report, despite the fact that Tiberi has easily held on to his seat since 2002. But Republicans, and Democrats for that matter, have not quickly forgotten Rep. Conor Lamb’s (D-PA) upset in a gerrymandered heavily pro-Trump district or Democrat Hiral Tipirneni’s close race in a deep-red Arizona district last month. Of the GOP candidates competing on Tuesday in the district’s primary, all the attention has been on state Sen. Troy Balderson, backed by Tiberi himself, and Melanie Leneghan, a conservative businesswoman who some view as potentially liable to lose the seat by alienating more moderate voters in the district. “We don’t want to see another PA-18, and she’s the candidate that would make that more likely here,” Borges told The Daily Beast. “The Republican will be favored to win either way, but I know for a fact the Democrats are rooting for her in this primary.”As Tiberi has invested heavily to boost Balderson, Leneghan has the backing of the House Freedom Caucus co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and the Club for Growth’s PAC has spent money on ads going after Balderson. “You’ve got to turn out the grassroots, if you’re going to win a special,” Jordan told Politico in a recent article. “So she’s the best one equipped to do that. She’s the best equipped to win the general.” But that is not how Borges and other Republican moderates in Ohio are viewing the race, as they are actively concerned that if the wrong person advances in the Tuesday contest, money might stop flowing in. “I worry about donors throwing up their hands in OH-12 if Tuesday goes the wrong way,” Borges told The Daily Beast. “But we’ll just have to see what happens.”"},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen Took Cash From Oligarch-Connected Firm',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Daily Beast can confirm that Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a company connected to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. The allegations were initially made Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, porn actress Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, and confirmed by a source familiar with the matter.“How the fuck did Avenatti find out?” the source asked The Daily Beast.According to a dossier published by Avenatti on Tuesday evening, “Vekselberg and his cousin Mr. Andrew Intrater routed eight payments to Mr. Cohen through a company named Columbus Nova LLC beginning in January 2017 and continuing until at least August 2017.” The funds, Avenatti suggested, may have been used to reimburse Cohen for the $130,000 payment made to Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. Intrater was also a donor to the Republican National Committee, on which Cohen served as a deputy finance chairman. In June 2017, Intrater donated $35,000 to a joint fundraising committee for the RNC and Trump’s reelection campaign. He also gave a quarter-million dollars to Trump’s inaugural committee. (Previously, Intrater gave only to Democrats like Gov. Bill Richardson and Sen. Ted Kennedy.)Intrater and Vekselberg have also been active investors in the U.S. technology and media sectors. Columbus Nova Technology Partners was the first and only outside investor in Gawker Media, before the company was felled by a lawsuit funded by Trump ally Peter Thiel. Columbus Nova also backed the record label of former Def Jam boss Lyor Cohen, invested in the streaming-music pioneer Rhapsody, and put money behind a gig-economy site, a “genetic risk” firm, and a company called Tomfoolery Incorporated.In a statement, Columbus Nova lawyer Richard Owens of Latham & Watkins insisted that Vekselberg did not have an ownership interest in the firm. “Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved in or provided any funding for Columbus Nova’s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue,” Owens said. “Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else outside of Columbus Nova was involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.”However, up until Tuesday night, Columbus Nova’s own website described the company is “the U.S. investment vehicle for the Renova Group”—Vekselberg’s asset-management firm. The site also noted that Intrater “is a former Director and current Member of the Executive Board of Renova Group.” (That page of the site was suddenly removed early Wednesday morning.)In addition, Columbus Nova was listed on the website for the Renova Group as one of its “companies” until late last year, as NBC News reported. (That website is currently “under construction.”) Through Renova, Vekselberg has holdings all over the world—including a 26.2 percent stake in Rusal, the aluminum-producing giant owned by Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch now infamous for bankrolling former Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort. The U.S. government imposed economic sanctions on both Deripaska and Vekselberg in early April. But later that month, the U.S. Treasury Department, in effect, slow-rolled the sanctions, giving companies and individuals until late October to get out of business with Rusal, which is appealing Washington’s ruling. “Given the impact on our partners and allies, we are... extending the maintenance and wind-down period while we consider Rusal’s petition,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.According to The New York Times, Vekselberg was recently questioned by federal agents working with special counsel Robert Mueller. CNN reported that those queries involved the oligarch’s payments to Cohen.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.While Cohen’s lawyers refused to comment on the payments, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani dismissed the news as Avenatti having foreseen the president’s Tuesday withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal—part of “one of the best days of the Trump presidency”—and simply trying to “stink it up as much as possible.”Cohen and Trump’s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But this development could put further pressure on the president’s inner circle. If Avenatti’s analysis is correct and the payments violated federal banking law, then Cohen could be in serious legal jeopardy. There are reportedly concerns in the president’s inner circle that Cohen could begin cooperating with investigators. The greater the legal jeopardy he faces, the greater pressure he will face to cooperate. And he wouldn’t be the only one; former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump campaign official Rick Gates are already cooperating with Mueller’s investigators. Meanwhile, Avenatti is making a sport of riding Cohen in the press.When Cohen appeared in federal court last month, Avenatti and his porn-star client were in the gallery watching. Following the appearance, Daniels crowed to a gaggle of reporters, “For years, Mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law, he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as Mr. Trump’s fixer. He has played by a different set of rules, or should we say no rules at all.”“That ends now,” Daniels concluded.Avenatti also filed a defamation claim against Cohen one day after Daniels’ highly anticipated 60 Minutes appearance. Days after Cohen won a 90-day stay in Daniels’ lawsuit and said he’d invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in the case, Avenatti filed a defamation claim against the president.—Additional reporting by Lisa Schwartz and Betsy WoodruffUPDATE: This story has been updated with a statement from Columbus Nova and additional information on its relationship to Viktor Vekselberg."},
 {'title': '‘She Wanted It’: California Lawmaker Sexually Harassed, Assaulted Staffers, Lawsuit Claims',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A California lawmaker is once-again facing accusations that he sexually harassed and assaulted staffers, including an instance in which he allegedly defended himself by claiming one victim “wanted it,” according to a lawsuit filed by his former chief of staff.Republican Assemblyman Devon Mathis previously faced allegations of sexual assault in November. Those earlier claims could not be substantiated by the Sacramento Police Department, which closed the investigation, the Sacramento Bee reported.However, Mathis’s ex-chief of staff, Sean Doherty, now claims the politician retaliated against him after he reported concerns about the lawmaker’s allegedly inappropriate behavior to the Assembly’s rules committee. Doherty has also accused the panel of not just failing to act on the complaints, but also of notifying Mathis about the reports against him. Mathis was elected in 2014 and represents the state’s 26th District, which includes parts of California’s Central Valley.Doherty—who alleges wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and breach of contract—filed the suit in a state superior court in Sacramento last week. He’s seeking statutory, tort, and punitive damages.Doherty, who was hired by the lawmaker in 2015, claims he “observed or learned of Mathis’ inappropriate relationships with staff, allegations and incidents of sexual harassment and assault, discrimination against female employees, and misuse of state resources.”According to the complaint, Mathis allegedly forced members of his staff into “inappropriately close relationships” with him, “treating them as friends and drinking buddies, rather than subordinates.” The lawmaker is said to have created a “permanent schedule” for all of his employees “to accompany him at evening events where most attendees were drinking,” the court filings state.“There were no exceptions, even for staffers with families, who attended night school, or did not drink,” the lawsuit claims.One woman allegedly approached Doherty at an event to tell him the lawmaker “‘needs to stop grabbing my ass; every time he’s around, he’s hitting on me.’”On another occasion, a witness allegedly found the politician in a bedroom assaulting a passed-out staffer who had vomited and then fallen asleep after drinking more than she could handle. According to the lawsuit, Mathis allegedly excused himself to go to the bathroom after the staffer had been put to bed, and when the witness went looking for him, she said she walked in on the lawmaker groping the suddenly half-dressed woman. She “woke up during the [resulting] commotion and asked, ‘Was he fingering me?’” according to the court documents.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Later, when Doherty confronted his boss about the alleged attack, the lawmaker didn’t deny it, the complaint claims. Mathis allegedly assured Doherty: “She wanted it.”The former chief of staff claims he sought assistance from the chamber’s rules committee at least four separate times in an effort “to rein in” his boss’ allegedly inappropriate behavior. “They did not help,” the complaint claims.Meanwhile, after he reported the behavior to the committee, Doherty’s relationship with Mathis “started to deteriorate more rapidly,” leading him to believe someone had informed his boss about the communication.“This hampered Doherty’s efforts to improve Mathis’ behavior, created a hostile work environment, and resulted in the retaliation that ultimately led to Doherty’s wrongful termination,” according to the lawsuit, which names as defendants Mathis, the Assembly Rules Committee State Assembly, and several human-resource officials at the legislature.The retaliation, according to the lawsuit, came in the form of “two un-founded sexual harassment complaints against Doherty...even though the Assembly neither investigated nor acted on the complaints.”“Doherty denied and continues to deny the complaints,” the document claims. He allegedly believes that they were made “by a Mathis ally or someone under Mathis’s control for the purpose of inoculating Mathis.”According to Our Valley Voice, Doherty was fired by Mathis’ office “for sexually explicit comments and verbal abuse of staffers.”Two former employees who worked for Mathis have said that Doherty’s claims were inaccurate and that all of the allegations in the lawsuit describe behavior that the former chief of staff actually perpetrated himself.Trystine Payer, who worked as an intern and then an assistant in Mathis’ office, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that she was harassed “every single day” by Doherty.“He asked me if my boobs were real, what sized bra I wore,” she said over the phone. “I cannot believe that Sean is trying to play a victim in something that he created.” Trent Lindsey, a former local field representative for Mathis, told the Voice: “Doherty would make inappropriate comments about female staffers in the legislative office. He would say things like, ‘I wonder what she is willing to do for me since I got her hired,’ or ‘I’m gonna try to f**k that one.’\xa0 These comments were also extended to my spouse and Mathis’ spouse.”Mathis responded to the new allegations in a statement to the Sacramento Business Journal: “This is a baseless suit filed by a disgruntled former employee who was terminated by the Assembly." The rules committee did not provide comment to the publication.California is one of many states now fielding sexual harassment or assault allegations against its members. In February, the state’s legislature released documents that detailed accusations against 18 lawmakers and staffers from the past 10 years.'},
 {'title': 'Free-Speech True Believer Dave Rubin, the Top Talker of the ‘Intellectual Dark Web,’ Doesn’t Want to Talk About His Own Ideas',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Dave Rubin is having a moment. He’s getting name-checked in The New York Times, speaking at college campuses across the country, serving as the opening act for author/clinical psychologist/self-help guru Jordan Peterson on a sold-out tour of theaters, and watching the audience for his YouTube-based talk show The Rubin Report grow by the day.I first heard about Rubin from a friend who thought I would appreciate the erstwhile comedian and self-styled classical liberal’s talk show, particularly for its focus on free speech, civil conversations with iconoclastic thinkers from across the political spectrum, and its rejection of identity politics. Having spent years writing and reporting about the many trans-partisan and international threats to free expression, despising the culture of shouting down or physically attacking political opponents, loathing communist apologia, suffering from no illusions about the threat posed by radical political Islam, and identifying politically as an independent civil libertarian—I would indeed seem to be the target audience.Rubin is both lauded and criticized for his non-confrontational at-all-costs interviewing style, with fans appreciating his willingness to have an open dialogue with everyone from fringe characters associated with the alt-right to distinguished academics to disaffected progressives to ex-Muslims, allowing for a more thorough airing of their beliefs beyond controversial soundbites. Rubin’s oft-repeated principle to “judge people as individuals, and not as a collective” and reject identity politics would seem to align with The Rubin Report’s stated billing as “a talk show about big ideas and free speech.”Critics, and even some former guests, have countered that Rubin’s mission is belied by the fact that he directs essentially all of his socio-political criticisms toward a very broadly-defined left, offers virtually no condemnations of President Trump or the right writ large for analogous authoritarian and censorious transgressions, has positively platformed and appeared with bigots, ultra-nationalist identitarians, and hoax conspiracy theorists—and by what some see as a disingenuous positioning of himself as a critic of the left from the left.A Political Awakening While not as widely recognized as traditional TV talk shows, The Rubin Report—which boasts 150 million views as of this writing—resides squarely in a community of right-leaning political YouTube channels which have usurped the old guard of talk radio and Fox News by providing a gatekeeper-free alternative. Should there be a young person in your family expressing a newfound disgust with cultural Marxism, the regressive left, and soy, there’s a good chance he or she spends a good amount of time consuming political chatter on YouTube.In this new media ecosystem The Rubin Report stands out as consistently polished and professionally produced, particularly compared to other heavyweights of the genre which feature nothing but a wall map or a blank white wall as set design. With shots of smiling guests serving as clickable title cards and each episode consisting of a monologue called “the Direct Message,” an interview titled “the Sit Down” or on occasion a “Panel” of opposing voices moderated by the host—The Rubin Report looks like real TV, and boasts an audience rivaling many cable news programs.In five years, The Rubin Report has evolved from a low-key lefty panel show on The Young Turks network to an independently-funded channel of its own, with over 700,000 subscribers and fan support through Patreon totaling more than $30,000 per month. The stature of the show’s guest list has grown from its humble beginnings to now boast such mainstream political figures as Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) and Atlantic senior editor and former Bush speechwriter David Frum, celebrity comics like Roseanne Barr, Bob Saget, and Michael Ian Black, and noted intellectuals including Steven Pinker, Laura Kipnis, and Thomas Sowell.Rubin has said in interviews that his break with The Young Turks stemmed from a political awakening that modern-day progressivism had descended into a morass of unthinking intersectionality and “oppression Olympics.” After receiving a smiling send-off from The Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur, The Rubin Report moved to the RYOT network in 2015, then briefly to Larry King’s Ora TV, before going fully independent in 2016.The Rubin Report has since aspired to be the hub of an “idea revolution,” marked by long free-wheeling discussions that eschew “gotcha” questions. A profile in The Spectator praised the show’s lack of “booby traps and barely disguised agendas,” while The Knife described it as a venue of “critical thinking and honorable discourse… where opposing arguments can coexist and thrive,” adding that the show provides “thorough exploration of viewpoints that are outside of the main perspectives and biases commonly heard in traditional media.” Rubin has frequently attributed his inclination to have friendly conversations with anyone—even the supposedly untouchably toxic—as inspired by the man he calls a “mentor,” legendary talk show host Larry King, who in his six decades-long career has conducted thousands of nonconfrontational interviews with everyone from celebrities and world leaders to racists like Louis Farrakhan and David Duke.“That is the correct way, in my opinion, to approach it,” King tells The Daily Beast in an email, adding that he never argued with guests and always wanted “the audience to determine what they think of the person being interviewed.” King says he considers Rubin “smart and passionate” about politics, but that their styles diverge because Rubin is more “open to giving his opinions on things than I am.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.And that is the key difference between Rubin’s technique and his mentor’s. While King dispassionately asked questions and sat back, Rubin frequently opines throughout lengthy conversations—most often in diatribes against social justice warriors, the “crumbling” mainstream media, and the regressive left—while presenting a point of view his guest is inclined to agree with, often without even asking a question at all.The Intellectual Dark WebThe Rubin Report is considered the talk show home of the “intellectual dark web”—a term coined by mathematician and Thiel Capital managing director Eric Weinstein to describe a loosely-defined movement of critical thinkers with varying political allegiances united by an opposition to politically correct groupthink, unafraid to discuss what they say are forbidden topics. Commonly accepted charter members of the IDW include neuroscientist Sam Harris, Daily Wire editor and podcaster Ben Shapiro, former Evergreen State University professors Heather Haying and Bret Weinstein (Eric’s brother), and of course Jordan Peterson—currently a global phenomenon thanks to his wildly popular YouTube lectures and best-selling book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.American Enterprise Institute scholar and self-described conservative Democrat feminist Christina Hoff Sommers—a Rubin Report guest and Intellectual Dark Webber herself—tells The Daily Beast that because the show is “long enough that you get a sense of [the guests’] interests and their ideas” a viewer can come away with a different perspective on certain people who have been “badly mischaracterized.”Harris concurs, telling The Daily Beast that Rubin hosts “an unusually wide range of guests” and “allows the conversation to breathe,” both of which are missing from typical talk show fare. Harris adds that while his own style of interviewing calls for pushback on guests he disagrees with, he admires Rubin’s chosen style which necessitates “trust[ing] his audience to sort it out more than many other people would.”Harris says he “still considers himself liberal on virtually every relevant point” and has indicated to Rubin that he doesn’t believe The Rubin Report devotes enough criticism of President Trump and what has become of the right in the Trump era. For his part, Rubin freely admitted in a Reddit AMA last year that he was disinterested in attacking Trump because “literally hundreds of outlets” already were, and that he believed “post modernism and the the [sic] Left are a much bigger danger to the future of western civilization.”“What Dave may be experiencing is getting captured by his audience,” Harris explains, adding that the interactive nature of YouTube might influence Rubin to give his audience what it wants. Harris says, “YouTube has essentially been swallowed by the alt-right,” making criticism of Trump an invitation to blowback from the MAGA and Pepe crowd. Still, Harris agrees with Rubin that the current “moral panic” on the left over “controversial ideas and the reflexive effort to silence these ideas or to destroy the reputations of anyone who would discuss these ideas” is more troubling than any threats to free expression on the right.Interviewer or PublicistRubin’s critics are less forgiving of the notion that challenging guests with deservedly disreputable reputations on their ideas would constitute an unfair “gotcha” line of inquiry.A typical, but hardly unique example of such a Rubin Report guest is InfoWars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson—another hugely popular political YouTuber—and his long history of promoting conspiracy theories including tinfoil-hat fare on chemtrails, fluoride, and Obama’s birth certificate, along with ruminations on whether the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting and 7/7 London bombings were government false flag operations.Introducing Watson on an April 2016 appearance on The Rubin Report, the host dismissed his critics’ anger at providing Watson with another platform as “conspiracy theories about the conspiracy theory” and said that he preferred to “talk it out and see what happens,” before launching into praise of a Watson video critical of “the regressive left” and inquiring on how Watson came to work with Alex Jones—the InfoWars host arguably most notable for his many suggestions that the Sandy Hook massacre never happened. Though Rubin didn’t ask Watson to defend his history of propagating fake news, he did suggest that Watson was part of a “new growing [political] center."The pseudonymous blogger, artist, and host of the Polite Conversations podcast who goes by the name Eiynah is as an ex-Muslim left-winger frequently critical of the anti-free speech left, who also regularly criticizes Rubin. In an interview with The Daily Beast Eiynah says she believes there is value to conducting civil interviews with seemingly untouchable figures, but by “setting up strawman questions” and “soft-balling” his guests, Rubin is essentially acting not as an interviewer but as a PR person. Referring to a comment Rubin made on his show that the mainstream media is so “terrible” and full of “bullshit” that it has created “a necessary space” for the factually challenged InfoWars, Eiynah says such an idea is “dangerous and ridiculous for someone who claims to value the truth.”Sam Seder, the Majority Report host and a progressive critic of Rubin’s, has publicly lobbied to be invited on The Rubin Report—a challenge, in Seder’s telling, to see if Rubin will “walk the walk” on his support of diversity of thought and civil debate knowing Seder intends to question Rubin on his supposed liberal bona fides.Rubin declined Seder’s request via Twitter after Seder’s producer posted a video calling Rubin “stupid.” Seder tells The Daily Beast that he quickly pulled the video, apologized, and has pledged to be a civil (if combative) guest—noting that he has hosted numerous libertarians and conservatives in debate on his own show—but Rubin has thus far ignored the entreaty. Obviously, no one has the right to be booked on anyone else’s show, but Seder argues that Rubin’s singular focus on “criticizing the left ostensibly from a position on the left” while mainstreaming some odious figures on the right proves The Rubin Report is not “an all-comers platform.”Of the threats to free speech facing the country, Seder notes that the legislation being pursued nationally—sometimes already enacted on a state level—that essentially bans the anti-Israel Boycott Divest Sanction (BDS) movement from expressing itself should be “setting off alarm bells” for “free speech absolutists." On the Rubin Report, a show nominally about “free speech” where no idea is too dangerous to engage, the topic is not broached. The New Political Center A February 2017 video hosted by the conservative PragerU YouTube channel titled “Why I Left the Left” stars Rubin, who looks directly into the camera and says: “Today’s progressivism has become a faux moral movement, hurling charges of racism, bigotry, xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, and a slew of other meaningless buzzwords at anyone they disagree with,” adding that progressives only value diversity, but not “diversity of thought.” The video has been viewed well over 6 million times, PragerU’s biggest hit. Rubin also makes regular speaking appearances with the conservative student group Turning Point USA (notable of late thanks to Kanye West’s tweet praising its communications director and “Red Pill Black” YouTuber Candace Owens) and has a professional association with the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies’ Learn Liberty program, which supplies The Rubin Report with IHS academics as guests and pays the production costs of such episodes.IHS president Emily Chamlee-Wright says in an email that Learn Liberty was drawn to Rubin for his “humility and love of big ideas, his focus on the importance of free speech and open inquiry, and his humor and ability to draw out his guests (even when he disagreed),” adding that IHS “faculty benefit from reaching an even larger audience, further challenging and honing their ideas.” (Disclosure: I was once awarded a partial scholarship from IHS, which I ended up declining after choosing not to attend graduate school.)Rubin’s political identity is amorphous. Though he chafes at being labelled “right wing,” Rubin conceded in an interview with Ben Shapiro where he likened progressivism to a “mental disorder” that his preferred label of “classic liberal” [sic] is essentially libertarian or conservative. His regularly deployed political maxim is that he remains a liberal because he married another man, opposes the death penalty, supports marijuana legalization and prison reform, conditionally supports reproductive rights, and also supports a social safety net and strong public schools.Marijuana legalization is a pretty straightforward position, but by mostly eschewing details on economic issues and offering sometimes contradictory views on health care, it’s hard to know where Rubin actually stands on actual policies. It is perfectly natural—and in certain cases, admirable—to evolve on political positions and also lack passionate opinions on topics above one’s paygrade. But a great many libertarians and conservatives are capable of articulating their disagreements with President Trump and the right. Rubin, however, struggles to cede such ground.In a July 2017 interview on the progressive David Pakman Show, Rubin vaguely criticized President Trump for issuing a “ton” of executive orders, noting that he was also critical of Presidents Bush and Obama for doing the same, but declined to critique any specific Trump policy. In a January 2018 interview with The Daily Nerv, a conservative college student-run website, Rubin said that other than “a bit of a religious tone with the right,” he couldn’t think of anything he would criticize on the right. Professional right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos told Rubin in a March 2016 interview that the alt-right was correct in believing that the Jews run the banks and the media, to which the host replied “I don’t even know where to start with that, so just go,” before Yiannopolous continued to run interference for alt-right anti-Semitism, saying Jews are “vastly disproportionately represented in all of these professions. That’s just a fact. It’s not anti-Semitic to point out statistics.” Yiannopolous then argued that most online anti-Semitism was harmless “trolling” and a “direct response to the language policing, a direct response to people being told they can’t say things,” denied there was any legitimate white supremacist movement in the U.S., and added, “if there is a racial supremacist movement, it’s Black Lives Matter, and it’s very well funded.” Once Yiannopolous stopped to take a breath, Rubin said “I’m with you on a lot of this,” but offered no pushback.In a 2016 livestream, Rubin said that while he rejects white supremacy and neo-Nazism, “the alt-right as a shitposting, fun, call out the bullshit, mock-the-power thing is amazing,” adding “there’s nothing funny coming out on the left now… They’re a bunch of preachy little bitches right now. The left is crumbling… you know where the funny stuff is coming? It’s coming out of the alt-right. That doesn’t mean I’m a Nazi.” Libertarian journalist Cathy Young, a one-time Rubin Report guest, tells The Daily Beast in an email she has “nothing but good things to say” about her interaction with Rubin on the show and singled-out for praise his interview with James Damore—the former Google engineer fired for writing a controversial memo to colleagues arguing that the biological differences between men and women make the latter less suited to roles in the tech industry—who Young believes was “rather egregiously misrepresented in the mainstream media.”Young said that while Rubin’s style often works well, his approach of “asking his guests sympathetic questions, almost never challenging them, and often reinforcing their answers with enthusiastic agreement” fails when interviewing people who are either unreasonable or dishonestly representing themselves—such as YouTuber and accused “cult” leader Stefan Molyneux, who Young describes as “a crank with a long record of misogyny and racism (the real kind, not just ‘politically incorrect opinions’) who masquerades as a rational ‘new centrist’ and whom Rubin has treated as an ally against ’social justice warriors.’”Rubin might be correct in criticizing the left for moving the Overton Window to the point that any number of right-of-center figures are unjustly tarred as “far-right,” but he has suggested or stated that alt-light YouTubers such as Watson, Molyneux, and Pizzagate propagandist/rape apologist Mike Cernovich all fit in what he’s described as a new political center—a shift in the Overton Window that at the very least begs a more precise explanation of how Rubin would define the current political spectrum.If identity politics is “the scourge of our time,” as Rubin has said, there would appear to be a disconnect in principle to having hosted uncritical interviews with Canadian YouTuber Lauren Southern—an alt-right fellow traveler and identitarian who argued on The Rubin Report that Richard Spencer’s white nationalism was unfairly characterized as white supremacy and that the Canadian Nazi party was “backed up and egged on” by a Jewish organization because they wanted “more, like, kind of hate crimes to point out”—and Tommy Robinson, the British ultra-nationalist activist who prior to appearing on The Rubin Report was known for saying “every single Muslim” had “got away with” the 7/7 bombings and tweeting “I’d personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the EU over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could. Fake refugees.”Rubin later told British columnist Katie Hopkins that in his view Robinson’s politics were “extremely moderate.” As to Hopkins—who before appearing on the Rubin Report was noteworthy for likening migrants to cockroaches and “a plague of feral humans,” as well as calling for a “final solution” following an Islamist terror attack in Manchester—Rubin stated that there was nothing he had seen that would lead him to believe the charges of bigotry leveled against her were fair.The absence of skeptical cross examination of identity-obsessed right-wing figures—while insinuating that their detractors are the actual identity politics-obsessed bigots—makes Rubin’s critics dubious of the suggestion that his interviewing style is designed to provide his most odious guests with enough rope to hang themselves (as the old saw goes).Debate Everything, Let the Best Ideas Win \xad\xadRubin explained on his show in 2015, “there is nothing more important in a democracy than free speech and debate. We should debate everything…we should engage in ideas we are not comfortable with and let the best ideas win.” At the start of an interview last year on The Alex Jones Show, Rubin boasted that he had not been presented with questions or topics ahead of time. Yet when this civil libertarian journalist made multiple requests for a recorded in-person, phone or Skype interview, Rubin declined, asking for emailed questions and then refusing to answer them. Had Rubin obliged an actual interview, I would have liked to know if he had come to any new realizations about the awesome reach of new media, and how platforming and agreeing with certain people and their ideas can be reasonably construed as an endorsement. I wonder if he has come to understand that not merely talking to people with legitimately maligned ideas, but endorsing them as reasonable or centrist has consequences—both for the host and his audience.Over a week after our email exchange and hours before this piece was to be published, Rubin posted a new Direct Message, responding to some of these very concerns which had been raised by Bari Weiss in her recent New York Times Magazine piece on the Intellectual Dark Web. In the video, Rubin again compares his interviews with controversial figures to those of Larry King, calling the idea that he endorses the things his guests say on his show “patently absurd and actually quite dangerous.” Rubin addressed the “guff” he has received for his interviews with Molyneux and Cernovich, but said he was “absolutely proud of” his conduct as an interviewer. He also addressed his appearance on The Alex Jones Show, which he defended on the grounds that it allowed him to bring his “message of conversation and classical liberalism to Jones’ audience.” Finally, he pledged to “increase my efforts to shed light on ideas that [guests] have that I’m concerned are unsavory.”As a new media entrepreneur known to drop his trademark civility when slagging “biased” mainstream journalists as “activists” and—in the insult parlance of right-wing YouTubers—soy drinkers, I would have liked to ask if he believed he had ever let his own biases get the best of him during an interview, as when he declared the anarcho-communist collective Antifa (a group of which I have been a vocal critic) was “creating the most illegal violence” in the United States. I might have asked if he was aware that for all of Antifa’s repulsive violence, left-wing political violence pales in comparison to its right-wing counterpart, the latter of which is responsible for 71 percent of political or religiously motivated killings in the U.S. over the past decade—a figure more than double the deaths attributed to Islamic and left-wing extremists combined.If ideas are paramount, Rubin has a responsibility to his audience to seek the truth and explore difficult discussions which might make his own audience uncomfortable.\xa0If he treats one side of the political spectrum as an unthinking, authoritarian monolith—typically hosting left-of-center guests who spend much of their time on The Rubin Report criticizing the left—while giving a pass or pleading ignorance to the sins of the right, his audience is left with an incomplete and inaccurate view of where threats to free speech and civil liberties emanate.By choosing to speak at Turning Point USA events, Rubin bestows his imprimatur on a group which has colluded with Republican state lawmakers in an attempt to have a public university instructor fired for protesting one of their student activists, which curates a “professor watchlist” to “expose and document” college professors who “advance leftist propaganda in the classroom,” and whose executive director Charlie Kirk has called for teachers and even entire schools which offend his sensibilities to be dismissed and defunded. If The Rubin Report is a show built on free speech and nonpartisan skepticism of government, surely there is room to discuss the Republican proposed-bills which would criminalize certain forms of protest, the state bans on discussing homosexuality in public schools, the right-wing attempts to ban “problematic” books from schools, or President Trump’s long-held hostility toward the First Amendment. After all, these are threats on free expression coming from the government—not college students, postmodernist professors or alt-right shitposters. Rubin is not incorrect that a disquieting portion of the left in many academic, journalistic, and media institutions engage in a destructive and incoherent call-out culture while pre-emptively declaring an ever-growing number of ideas beyond the pale of discussion. But in failing to offer even cursory pushback on cynical internet hoax artists, avowed identitarians, and anti-immigrant YouTubers who use his show to peddle pseudo-science as evidence for declaring certain races to be genetically prone to criminality, The Rubin Report falls short of an “idea revolution,” and at its worst moments is essentially a re-packaging of reactionary disinformation in a shiny, smiling, high-definition talk show pageant.Perhaps The Rubin Report intends to move on from the old gang of “centrist” alt-light YouTubers it hosted mere months ago, now that the Intellectual Dark Web’s notoriety grows by the day and Rubin’s gig as Jordan Peterson’s opening act has him performing his brand of crowd-work comedy to sold-out audiences.Maybe Rubin’s view of where the “new political center” resides has evolved over the past year. Could be that Rubin intends to live up to his maxim that he’ll bridge the partisan divide and explore even the most radical ideas by deferentially entertaining the views of an economic Marxist or an intersectional feminist or a pro-Palestinian advocate or a Black Lives Matter \xadactivist or anyone who might be inclined to forcefully disagree with his oft-stated political beliefs.A forthright and critical conversation with Rubin—a professional talker whose style and reach have at times, in my view, provided illiberalism with a space to take root and grow—intrigues me. But for now at least, I’m left to find Rubin’s big ideas on YouTube.'},

  'body': "As a child, I knew this kid who said his father was a 100-year-old astronaut. He said his dad was 100 years old because he was a kind of dumb kid; he believed that people kept growing indeterminately like sharks or crocodiles. He wanted us to believe his father was enormous, out there in space. The lie was so ridiculous that nobody even challenged him. He kept repeating that he had a 100-year-old father who was in space. We knew it was a lie, but probably figured that whatever was going on behind the scenes to lead to a lie that weird was something we didn’t want to be mixed up with. He probably thinks the lie worked. In a way, it did. It’s not easy for some public figures to have the truth believed, even when they produce evidence to support it. President Barack Obama had to produce a long-form copy of his birth certificate to show he had not been born in Kenya, and many of the people who were “just asking” still didn’t believe him. Hillary Clinton released years of tax returns and a full health report, and many of the people who were “just asking” still didn’t believe her finances were above board or that she wasn’t a frail old lady. President Trump has spent the last three years or so doing the political equivalent of telling America that his dad is 100 years old and lives in outer space. And nothing has happened to him, apart from a parade of Good Sir! Monologues from pundits and politicians who seem like they’re auditioning for a community theater play called Mr. Smith Gets A Cable News Contributor Contract. His sycophants in Congress shrug; his sycophants with publishing deals write books with titles like Let Trump Be Trump. His supporters and enablers nod, or shrug, or change the subject. He’s a beneficiary of a society that spends its credulity in the wrong places. Trump is a twice-divorced serial philanderer who doesn’t pay his contractors, so history shows us he’s not great at keeping promises. He lies about easily disprovable things, like the size of crowds and the height of buildings. When 19 women accused him of sexual misconduct, he accused them all of being liars. Stormy Daniels and Karen MacDougal, two alleged former mistresses, also liars. He’s lied about saying things that he said on tape. He never released his tax returns.This week we learned that Trump, a fat old man who eats trash, dictated his doctor’s letter calling him the “healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” during the campaign (a letter that was about as believable as the now-infamous “Best Sex I Ever Had” Marla Maples New York Post cover). We also learned that Trump knew about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels long before he had admitted publicly to knowing about them. Trump’s approval rating has a ceiling in the low 40s; the majority of Americans don’t think too highly of him and never will. Lots of people agree that he’s a liar. But there’s something deeply sick about a country where that many people view the word of women and non-whites with suspicion while accepting or ignoring obvious lies from loud white men. Something tells me that the Venn diagram documenting people who threw around the #HillarysHealth hashtag and people who shrug in response to President Trump’s brazen lying is a single circle. I’ve tried to imagine how this would play out under a President Donna Trump. It’s impossible to picture it because the public would never let a woman or non-white person who lies like Trump does get as far as Trump has. This isn’t to suggest that women should be allowed to get away with Trumpian lying. Nobody should. Sarah Huckabee Sanders shouldn’t. She was finally cornered during a press conference this week and confronted about her credibility, given that she lies an awful lot. She told the press corps that she just repeats what she’s told (by a guy who lies all the time).John Kelly shouldn’t get away with lying, either. But the White House chief of staff got away with smearing Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson by mischaracterizing a speech she gave during a 2015 FBI building dedication as bragging. He never apologized to her, even after video surfaced that proved what he said wasn’t true. Kelly’s lie came on the heels of President Trump lying about knowing the name of deceased soldier La David Johnson. A lie sandwich. Nobody has pressed him on it since. On Election Day 2016, Hillary Clinton’s campaign had confetti that looked like shards of glass loaded into party cannons at Manhattan’s Javitz Center. The plan was: Hillary was going to win, the confetti would fire, the glass shards would mean all women had won, the glass ceiling had been shattered and hooray for feminism, we did it, we killed the patriarchy forever, etc. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

He’s broken down the wall between politics and pop culture, so now the news is culture and culture is the news and nobody can escape either one except through the sweet release of death. He’s broken down typical barriers between the decent and profane. He’s humiliated his wife, turned his favorite daughter and her dweeb of a husband into a national joke and case study in ineptitude, he’s ruined the careers of nearly everybody he brought with him. He’s crashed through all of the things that would stop a normal, shame-experiencing person like sliding glass doors that he didn’t even know were there, barging bloodily forward and through the next, the next, the next. He’s exposed the fact that men like him get away with things, as he demands proof from others and produces none for himself. As long as that double standard continues to exist, men like Trump will have virtually free reign to create their own planets. The rest of us can watch through the glass ceiling."},
 {'title': 'Bob Corker: No, Really, Trump Is Gonna Kill the Iran Nuclear Deal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned on Wednesday that President Donald Trump will “absolutely” withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in less than a month. “I think many of the people around the president… would like to see a framework agreement achieved. I think that’s a better outcome for our nation both in the short and long-term,” Corker told The Daily Beast.“I don’t think there’s any doubt at all” that Trump will pull the U.S. out of the agreement, the senator said earlier at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast with reporters.The comments, which come just weeks ahead of the May 12 deadline for the U.S. to certify the terms of the Obama-brokered nuclear agreement, are some of the starkest yet from the Tennessean who, despite his at time heated disagreements with Trump, still speaks with the president regularly.The Trump administration has sought to re-negotiate some of the terms of the Iran nuclear agreement in an effort to make the conditions more restrictive on Tehran, including the so-called “sunset” provisions, which allow some of the limitations on Iran’s nuclear program to expire. But Corker’s comments indicate that those negotiations with European partners are not progressing well. The senator, who is not seeking re-election this year, said he remained hopeful that negotiations would be successful, especially with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel set to visit the White House in the coming weeks. But he ultimately concluded that Trump is “perfectly fine walking away from” the deal.“But, again, it’s his decision. Executive decisions change when there’s a new executive,” Corker said, mentioning Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. “Executive agreements just do not stand the test of time. But I hope we reach a framework agreement.”Congress had been considering passing legislation to scrap the provisions requiring Trump to certify every few months whether Iran was complying with the terms of the deal. Corker, who worked closely with ousted national security adviser H.R. McMaster and fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the effort, was hopeful that it could allow the U.S. to quietly remain in the deal without requiring Trump to publicly approve an accord that he called the worst-negotiated deal in presidential history.But lawmakers, led by Corker, instead told the administration to come up with a framework agreement with the European partners before coming to Congress. Democrats weren’t likely to sign onto such legislation unless the Europeans were comfortable with a new framework that addresses the Trump administration’s concerns, Corker said.'},
 {'title': 'White House Aides Wouldn’t All Mind if Pruitt Bombs Before Congress',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When Scott Pruitt heads to Capitol Hill on Thursday, his future in the Trump administration hangs in the balance. The embattled Environmental Protection Agency administrator has few defenders left in the nation’s capital. And even inside the White House, there is a growing sense—indeed, desire—that the administration could potentially rid itself of its Pruitt problem were he simply to fall on his face before House lawmakers.Two White House officials told The Daily Beast that they hope Pruitt does “crash and burn”—as one put it—so as to possibly give the president the pretense to finally fire him. That sentiment isn’t shared universally. But few, if any, inside the White House are actively rooting for Pruitt to do well when he comes under questioning.Those feelings underscore the wave of frustration that has long been building between White House staff and Pruitt’s inner circle. Several top-ranking figures in the Trump orbit have wanted Pruitt ousted for weeks due to the mounting scandals and terrible press coverage, and wouldn’t mind yet another televised example showing why it’s time for the administrator to go.It’s a feeling not lost on the EPA higher-ups, either. Inside that agency, senior officials are perfectly aware that a slip-up at the hearings can and will be used to attempt to erode Pruitt’s standing inside 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. But that standing, in their estimation, has always been reliant on the president’s fondness for Pruitt and his performance at the EPA. When the administrator sits down before Congress on Thursday, the target audience will consist of just one person, the president, and their mission will be singularly focused: keep Trump happy.To that end, Pruitt has declined the help of the White House, but is calling members of Congress to discuss his testimony, solicit advice, and try to get a sense of what questions might be thrown his way, The Daily Beast has learned.The EPA administrator, who is reportedly set to pass the blame on to other staffers, will face two rounds of questioning before House Appropriations and Energy and Commerce subcommittees. Both hearings are ostensibly focused on the EPA’s budget. But Pruitt will face angry and skeptical lawmakers from across the aisle. Democrats are planning to pre-but the hearings with a press conference with environmental groups calling on Pruitt to resign. As for the hearings themselves, lawmakers have devised a streamlined approach that puts a heavy emphasis on connecting certain Pruitt scandals—such as his alleged ties to lobbyists—and the policies he’s sought to implement; while also making the case that he’s fundamentally unfit for the role. “I’ve never heard of a public official being able to hang on this long with this many scandals—and not a single one of them resolved,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) told The Daily Beast.Republicans are likely to be far more deferential. But they won’t necessarily be defensive. The expectation is that Pruitt will be pressed about his personal expenditures, his renting of a condo from a top D.C. lobbyist, and his dubious hiring practices, more so than the policy priorities of the EPA.“It’ll be a budget presentation and I suspect that he’ll get pretty much straight budget questions on the Republican side and he’ll probably have a pretty sustained attack from the Democratic side of the aisle—probably some questions about housing arrangements, questions about spending of money, questions about employees,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), a member of the appropriations committee. “So it’ll be, I would expect, a highly-charged hearing.”The congressman, who talked to Pruitt in recent days about the hearings, said he told Pruitt to expect “a fairly rugged hearing” and advised him to call each individual committee member ahead of time in order to put himself in a “stronger position” as he fights to save his job.“It could be make-or-break if he screws up or if the Democrats nail him on something,” said Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA), who sits on the energy committee. “He’s a very smart guy, so I think he’s going to be very well prepared even though he doesn’t want to take White House help… There’s a lot of stuff there that has to be explained.”Pruitt has decidedly little margin for error.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Privately, Republican lawmakers and aides are nervous that Pruitt’s testimonies will worsen his already precarious standing. In recent weeks, they have been reticent to directly address the allegations against the EPA chief and instead have focused on their satisfaction with his job performance, including his successful efforts to roll back many Obama-era environmental regulations that Republicans abhor. Other GOP lawmakers have laboriously sought to separate Pruitt’s job performance from his personal behavior.But for some in the party, even that has proven difficult to do. “Mr. Pruitt’s behavior has not set a good standard. He needs to hold a press conference and speak very frankly about the criticisms and admit the ones that are valid and then offer a defense for the ones that aren’t—and then he needs to stop doing it,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said in an interview. “You can’t say, ‘well, because I agree with his policies it’s OK for him to disregard the fact that the money he’s spending doesn’t belong to him.’ It belongs to taxpayers.”Others have been more cautious. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), who chairs the subcommittee responsible for oversight of the EPA, said in an interview that he is relying heavily on the results of pending White House and House Oversight Committee investigations into Pruitt’s conduct before weighing in. But even some of Pruitt’s staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill have begun questioning his continued presence atop the EPA. “I have to tell you that I am really going to be checking those who have accused him of things because I don’t know,” Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), a close personal friend and mentor, said in an interview. “Now, if all of that were true, I’d have serious questions. It’s a big ‘if’ right now.”"},

  'body': "Playmate Karen McDougal isn’t the only one who was paid off by the National Enquirer’s publisher in exchange for keeping quiet about President Trump’s personal life.The company made a $30,000 payout to a former doorman at a Trump building—preventing the employee from sharing a racy story about love-child rumors that could have jeopardized the reality-TV star’s presidential run, according to a bombshell AP report.The AP reports the doorman agreed to keep quiet about allegations that Trump fathered an illegitimate child with an employee at Trump World Tower, a residential skyscraper near the United Nations. The revelation comes weeks after McDougal sued to be released from her NDA with the Enquirer—and after porn star Stormy Daniels’ own nondisclosure agreement with Trump’s camp was revealed in a lawsuit.Indeed, one part of Daniels’ contract has raised eyebrows in recent weeks and ignited speculation about paternity rumors. A review of Daniels’ confidentiality agreement shows she’s barred from discussing Trump’s family, including “any alleged children.” The NDA also stops Daniels from revealing details on Trump’s “alleged sexual partners, alleged sexual actions or alleged sexual conduct,” and “related matters or paternity information.” MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell caused a stir last month when he tweeted about the “paternity” language in Daniels’ contract.Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, told The Wrap that mentions of “paternity” were “boilerplate language” and common in NDAs. He said Daniels was never impregnated by Trump and didn’t know if he fathered any love children. Still, both McDougal and Daniels said in interviews that the future president didn’t use a condom during intercourse.The woman in the Trump love-child rumor hasn’t been named—although she denied the story to the AP last August—and it’s unclear how the doorman became privy to the sordid detail. “This is all fake,” she told the AP. “I think they [the National Enquirer] lost their money.”The former doorman, Dino Sajudin, reportedly received $30,000 in exchange for relinquishing the rights to the rumor he’d heard about Trump.Sajudin snagged his hush money eight months before McDougal signed her contract with American Media Inc. in August 2016, the AP revealed.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The FBI raided the office and residence of Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, seeking records about the National Enquirer’s part in silencing McDougal. The feds are also pursuing documents on Cohen’s $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, as well as the infamous Access Hollywood tape. (Daniels is suing Trump and Cohen to invalidate the “hush agreement” about her alleged 2006 romp with The Donald.)Sajudin would have faced a $1 million penalty for divulging the rumor or terms of his NDA, the AP reported. He was released from the contract after the 2016 election, and after The Wall Street Journal began asking questions about it. AMI Editor Dylan Howard told the AP the doorman’s tip could have sold “hundreds of thousands” of magazines, but the story was killed because it “lacked any credibility.”David Pecker, AMI’s chairman and CEO, is close friends with Trump. According to a New Yorker report, one former AMI editor said the company “never printed a word about Trump” without Pecker’s approval. The National Enquirer didn’t shy away from publishing stories and photos relating to allegations of illegitimate children of other politicians.In October 2016, the Enquirer ran one piece under the headline “Bill Clinton Love Child — Shocking New Revelations.” The subheadline read, “Abandoned son asks Hillary: ‘Was it because I’m black?’”Another story the Enquirer published that month had the title: “Bill Clinton Love Child: Prostitute Mom Tells All.”In December 2007, the publication exposed married North Carolina Sen. John Edwards’ affair and child with Rielle Hunter after a “months-long” investigation."},
 {'title': 'Jeff Sessions Quietly Appointed a Prosecutor to Probe Trump’s Foes. That Could Be an Unprecedented Disaster.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The headlines called it a non-event when Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided not to appoint a special counsel to look into the special counsel after all. For the people who believe that fired FBI agent Andrew McCabe is at the center (with Hillary Clinton, natch) of a vast Deep-State conspiracy to bring down Donald Trump, this was a bitter disappointment.Or maybe not. As the stories noted farther down, Sessions did announce that sometime last fall, without saying anything publicly at the time, he had appointed the U.S. Attorney for Utah, John Huber, to team up with Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz to conduct an internal investigation into all the questions that Republicans in Congress have raised about the FBI and its allegedly raging anti-Trumpery.What does this mean? Don’t worry, say most people I’ve talked to. Norm Eisen of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington told me that “it is not unusual to task U.S. attorneys outside Washington with things like this because they’re outside the bubble” and that “Huber has a good and non-partisan reputation.” Brian Fallon, erstwhile spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s campaign, tells me he’s “not overly concerned (yet)” with this development, adding that a U.S. attorney like Huber has to work with FBI agents every day, so he’s unlikely to go out of his way to antagonize the bureau.Huber does have a solid rep. He was originally appointed by President Obama, as all the stories mentioned. However, what most stories didn’t mention is that Obama did not insist on appointing Democrats to fill U.S. attorney slots in red states, often naming Republicans just to avoid a Senate fight, especially if the state had two GOP senators (as Utah did when Obama named Huber). Most of them also didn’t mention that last year, Huber raised eyebrows by appearing at a press conference at the White House—a quite unusual move for an independent prosecutor—to tout (of all things!) aspects of Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.But fine. Let’s say he’s the straightest arrow in the history of arrows. I still say it’s worth taking a moment to recognize the enormous power the man has been handed; the grave extent to which he may one day hold the Constitution in his hands; and the unprecedented nature of the situation into which he’s been thrust.Let’s deal in detail with the last point, because if you’re news junkie enough to have followed all this for the last few days, you may be thinking: Unprecedented? No it’s not, Tomasky. Well, I beg to differ.It is true, as Eisen says above, that U.S. attorneys have sometimes been tasked with conducting these kinds of outside reviews. In the past few days, articles about Huber have often cited Patrick Fitzgerald, who was the U.S. attorney in Chicago when a certain Bush-era Justice Department official named James Comey tapped him to look into the Valerie Plame-Joe Wilson matter (it fell to Comey to choose Fitzgerald because Attorney General John Ashcroft had recused himself on the matter). In another case, Eric Holder, Barack Obama’s AG, appointed two U.S. attorneys to investigate possible illegal leaks of classified information from the White House to reporters (one of those USA’s, incidentally, was Rod Rosenstein; small world!).So technically, yes, there is precedent here. But there is a huge difference between those cases and this one. In those two cases, outside prosecutors were named to investigate potential wrongdoing by officials of the Bush and Obama administrations respectively. They were appointed because of political pressure from the press and the opposition party.In this case, Huber was appointed by Sessions not to investigate potential wrongdoing by Trump administration officials, but potential wrongdoing by its critics and/or its perceived enemies. And he was appointed because of pressure from within the president’s own party to go after the supposed Deep Staters.So on the surface, Huber’s appointment is “the same” as Fitzgerald’s and the other one, in that Huber is investigating possible malfeasance within the broad executive branch. But in raw political terms, it is precisely the opposite kind of case. Imagine if Eric Holder had appointed a U.S. attorney to look into possible illegal leaking within the IRS by officials who were critical of Lois Lerner. Conservatives’ brains would have exploded. Yet that is essentially what Sessions has done here, and so far, Washington is yawning.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Maybe this is why I noticed some chortling over the last couple days by two conservative commentators. Michael Goodwin, in his New York Post column, argues that this is part of the A.G.’s long game (“Sessions’ decision is far more complex than reports suggest”) and means that he will eventually name a second special counsel. A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed to me that Sessions left that door open.And on Fox recently, law professor Jonathan Turley—once upon a time a sorta-kinda liberal, but now a Federalist Society “contributor”—veritably gloated. “I think people are missing what could be a brilliant move here by Sessions,” Turley said. “What he did is he essentially combined the powers of the inspector general with the powers of a line prosecutor.”Again, maybe Huber is Louis Brandeis and Clarence Darrow and Atticus Finch (uh, the movie Atticus Finch, that is) all rolled into one. Maybe he (and Horowitz) will find no wrongdoing and say there should be no second special counsel to investigate the special counsel, and that will be that.But he is worth keeping an eye on. Those of us burdened with long memories recall reading a lot of quotes from Washington establishment types back in 1994 about how the guy named to replace independent counsel Robert Fiske was a man of utmost probity. That man was Ken Starr. At a moment of complacent forgetting, that seems maybe worth remembering."},
 {'title': 'Trump Thought He’d Picked His Perfect U.S. Attorney in Geoffrey Berman. He Was Very Wrong.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Trump must have figured Geoffrey Berman would make the perfect prosecutor.Like Trump, Berman is the son of a real estate developer.Like Trump, Berman graduated from Wharton School.Like Trump, Berman once owned a New Jersey sports franchise, in his case a minor league hockey team in Trenton, the Titans.Berman was a Republican and a managing shareholder at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig, home to Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s blindest supporters.Berman had even donated $5,400 to Trump’s campaign in 2016.So, after interviewing him in person, Trump decided Berman was just the one to become the new interim United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.That being the venue that covers Trump Tower and the rest of Manhattan, so the one venue other than Washington, D.C. where Trump was most likely to face legal jeopardy. And the Trumpian wisdom of the nod seemed affirmed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s characterization of it.“Deeply disturbing considering the conflicts of interest inherent by his potential jurisdiction on matters that could affect the president personally,” she said the Berman appointment. \xa0But what did this seemingly perfect prosecutor do when the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office got a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller concerning Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen?Did Berman wink?Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Did he stall?Did he go on the attack in the way of Trump’s mentor, the deceased, but never departed Roy Cohn? No, this guy Berman immediately went and recused himself like some Yankee version of Attorney General Jeff Session.How was Trump supposed to know that Berman has actual principles?In retrospect, there were hints of integrity early on, when a young Berman joined the Iran-Contra investigation. He was part of the three-prosecutor team that secured the probe\'s sole conviction, sending Thomas Clines of the CIA to prison.And the actual differences between the two real estate scions might have been obvious to anyone who followed the hockey team that Berman founded and then managed during a brief time when he joined his father in the family\'s real estate development business. Berman’s Trenton Titans were a big success and he sold the team at a big profit. Trump’s New Jersey Generals lost $22 million and took down a fledgling football league with it.Now Trump seems poised to take down himself, or at least his lawyer. And with the recusal by Berman the developer’s son, the referral from Mueller is being handled by the deputy U.S. Attorney, Robert Khuzami. He is the son of two professional ballroom dancers.That’s right, Mr. President, his dad and mom are ballroom dancers!Deputy U.S. Attorney Khuzami is a Republican and even spoke at the 2004 Republican convention in support of George W. Bush. But that will only make it harder for Trump to say he is the victim of Democrats.And Khuzami is an expert at financial crimes, having ordered the arrest of 120 people for securities fraud in a single day during his earlier time as a Manhattan federal prosecutor. He subsequently served as head of enforcement at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Khuzami was also a lead prosecutor in the biggest terrorism case to date, involving the Blind Sheik, Omar Abdel-Rahman. The Sheik and his codefendants were found guilty of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, as well plotting to bomb simultaneously the New York FBI headquarters, the United Nations and the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels. Khuzami\'s work on the case earned him the Attorney General\'s Exceptional Service Award for "extraordinary courage and voluntary risk of life in performing an act resulting in direct benefits to the Department of Justice or the nation.”The Blind Sheik’s attorney was Lynne Stewart, who was suspected of relaying \xa0messages to and from her client that enabled him to continue running his terror organization from prison. FBI agents who worked the case remember the hand-wringing within the Justice Department when they sought to secure a search warrant for Stewart’s office.The lawyers of the Department of Justice were hugely reluctant to authorize the search the sanctum of a fellow lawyer, even one who was facilitating terrorism. The agents had to establish highly probable cause and they had to detail exactly what they expected to find in the office. Even then, some in Justice were hesitant.But the Justice Department and then a federal judge finally signed off. The agents raided Stewart’s office. She was convicted and sentenced to a decade in prison, but granted compassionate release after four years. She died of cancer in 2017.By then, Khuzami had become a partner in a law firm, earning as much as $11 million in a year. He nevertheless returned to public service to become Berman\'s deputy in January. Berman\'s recusal made him the one in charge as the U.S. Attorney’s office moved to secure a search warrant for another well-known New York lawyer.If securing a warrant for a lawyer aiding a terror leader who bombed the World Trade Center was tough, imagine how difficult it must have been to secure one for the lawyer of a sitting president in a case involving alleged hush money over consensual sex with a porn star and a playmate. With regard to all such searches, the U.S. Attorneys\' Manual says: “There are occasions when effective law enforcement may require the issuance of a search warrant for the premises of an attorney who is a subject of an investigation, and who also is or may be engaged in the practice of law on behalf of clients. Because of the potential effects of this type of search on legitimate attorney-client relationships and because of the possibility that, during such a search, the government may encounter material protected by a legitimate claim of privilege, it is important that close control be exercised over this type of search.” Before taking the application to a judge, prosecutors must submit to their higher-ups a form “containing relevant information about the proposed search along with a draft copy of the proposed search warrant, affidavit in support thereof, and any special instructions to the searching agents regarding search procedures and procedures to be followed to ensure that the prosecution team is not ‘tainted’ by any privileged material inadvertently seized during the search.”Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, filling in for the recused Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is said to have given the final go ahead to Deputy U.S. Attorney Khuzami, filling in for the recused Berman. All four are Republicans.The prosecutors and agents then had to convince a judge, who surely wanted the most probable of probable cause and a precise description of what was being sought.At 7 a.m. Monday, FBI agents searched Cohen’s office, home and a hotel room that he had been using.The very fact that the Department of Justice had approved the warrant and a judge had then signed it suggests that Cohen is in considerable trouble.“There’s got to be something to it,” an agent who worked the Stewart case said of the Cohen case.On hearing of the search in a jurisdiction where he had appointed the seemingly perfect prosecutor, Trump declared it “an attack on our country… (and) what we all stand for.”Trump subsequently tweeted, “Attorney–client privilege is dead!” and “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!”In fact, the agents at each search location were accompanied by a “privilege team” of colleagues not involved in the investigation, but charged with preventing any intrusions into protected materials beyond the very specific parameters of the search. The case agents cannot even glance at a document or a computer file or phone data until the privilege team has given the okay.“While every effort should be made to avoid viewing privileged material, the search may require limited review of arguably privileged material to ascertain whether the material is covered by the warrant,” the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual says, “Therefore, to protect the attorney-client privilege and to ensure that the investigation is not compromised by exposure to privileged material relating to the investigation or to defense strategy, a ‘privilege team’ should be designated, consisting of agents and lawyers not involved in the underlying investigation.”The manual goes on, “Instructions should be given and thoroughly discussed with the privilege team prior to the search. The instructions should set forth procedures designed to minimize the intrusion into privileged material, and should ensure that the privilege team does not disclose any information to the investigation/prosecution team unless and until so instructed by the attorney in charge of the privilege team. Privilege team lawyers should be available either on or off-site, to advise the agents during the course of the search, but should not participate in the search itself.”Had the folks in Salem followed rules such as the manual details for searches and all other aspects of prosecution, the hunt would have been for naught. Not a single witch would have even been charged.Michael Cohen is another matter altogether. '},
 {'title': '‘Spygate’ Is Trump’s Latest Non-Scandal About the Russia Investigation',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump’s approach to the Russia investigation seems to be: “If at first you don’t deceive, try, try again.”On Wednesday, he coined the phrase “spygate” to describe the false claim that the FBI spied on his presidential campaign in 2016. “We’re calling it spygate,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn, inviting another comparison to the original “-gate” that brought down another president, Watergate.The claim is based on the reported use of an FBI informant during the campaign who spoke with three campaign officials to suss out whether the Trump team was compromised by the Kremlin or potentially working with it.Stefan Halper spoke with campaign advisors George Papadopoulos and Carter Page in London where he is an emeritus professor at the University of Cambridge. Halper also spoke to Sam Clovis, a campaign policy advisor who worked with the foreign policy team, in the United States. Clovis said their conversation was about China, not Russia. Page told the Washington Post he couldn’t even remember what they discussed. And Papadopoulos—who told an Australian diplomat in spring 2016 that Russia had “dirt” in the form of “thousands of emails” of Hillary Clinton—was asked by Halper to write a paper about oil fields in the Middle East, according to emails. Halper may have asked Papadopoulos whether he knew or was involved in Russian hacking of Democratic emails. (When asked by the FBI about what he told the Australian diplomat, Papadopoulos lied.)Halper never joined or attempted to join the Trump campaign. And far from trying to infiltrate the campaign, the FBI reportedly shied away from asking it about interactions with Russia for fear the voting public would learn there was an open investigation into Trump’s team.“Spygate” is the latest effort by Trump and his allies to discredit the Russia investigation, all the while they ignore or downplay the guilty pleas, indictments, and careers it has already cost. Instead, every time the investigation advances in the public eye, Trump counters with lies, exaggerations, or slander. In March 2017, after the New York Times reported that communications were intercepted between Russian agents and Trump campaign officials, Trump tweeted “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The subtext was that the Obama administration engaged in political espionage under the pretext of the Russia investigation. Therefore the investigation was irrevocably tainted, Trump and his allies claimed.“Every time the investigation advances in the public eye, Trump counters with lies, exaggerations, or slander.”After no evidence was found supporting Trump’s claim, he hinted he would deliver proof to the House intelligence committee. “We will be submitting things before the committee very soon that has not been submitted as of yet,” he told Tucker Carlson on March 15. Then wire “tap” became “unmasking.”Days after Trump’s promise, White House officials gave information to House intel committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes that he said showed Obama officials had improperly revealed the identity of U.S. persons incidentally surveilled. Trump even accused former national security adviser Susan Rice of breaking the law. Except Michael Flynn’s name wasn’t concealed in phone calls with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., according to former acting attorney general Sally Yates. While Rice said she did order unmasking of some Trump officials, it was to find out why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York during the presidential transition. “I didn\'t hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal," Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican on the House intel committee, told CNN following the revelations.So much for a “Watergate-style scandal,” as National Review put it then.Following Comey’s firing, Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to oversee the investigation. And right on cue, Trump privately drummed up another scandal: Mueller was too “conflicted” to investigate Trump because he was interviewed to be FBI director before his appointment; he worked for the same law firm that represented Trump\'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Mueller once had a dispute about fees at Trump’s golf club where he was a member.  Trump was even moved to order Mueller’s firing based on these conflicts until the White House counsel supposedly threatened to quit and Trump backed down. Publicly, Trump’s allies like Newt Gingrich modified this line of attack and accused Mueller’s team of being crypto-liberals hell bent on destroying the Republican president because several had donated to Democrats. Trump went public with that line in May 2018, saying: “So you have all these investigators; they’re Democrats. In all fairness, Bob Mueller worked for Obama for eight years.”Mueller is a registered Republican in the District of Columbia who served in several Republican administrations and donated to Republican candidates.After the “investigators are Democrats” attack petered out, Trump’s men in Congress seized on a variation: the FBI agents investigating Trump were part of a pro-Clinton conspiracy. “Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society," FBI lawyer Lisa Page wrote to senior FBI agent Peter Strzok the day after Trump won.Sen. Ron Johnson seized on this as a smoking gun. “The secret society—we have an informant talking about a group holding secret meetings off-site,” the Wisconsin Republican told Fox News. “There\'s so much smoke here, there\'s so much suspicions.”There was no secret society: it was a joke between lovers. Then came the biggest faux-scandal of all: Democratic dirt led the Obama Justice Department to spy on Carter Page, the Trump advisor. This time the deceit was furnished by Nunes and Republicans on the House intel committee, who demanded an application for a secret surveillance warrant, over the strenuous objections of the FBI and Justice Department. Trump allowed the “Nunes memo” to be declassified for public release and said after it “totally vindicates” him. Except it didn’t. Contrary to Republican claims, the Justice Department’s warrant application did not rely all that much on ex-British spy Christopher Steele’s dossier and did disclose that the dossier was indirectly paid for by political opponents of Trump, i.e., Democrats. While Trump and some Republicans keep striking at the roots of the Russia investigation, it has branched out to strangle Trump’s former national security adviser and his former campaign chairman, crept into the White House, and sprouted into investigations of Trump’s business and his longtime fixer. Whatever the next non-scandal is, it won’t stop the investigation.'},
 {'title': "In Michigan's Bellwether Macomb County, the Democrats Aren’t Breaking Through Yet",
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Macomb County, Michigan is where Democrats go for the hard truths to save their party. The working-class suburb of Detroit sent Bill Clinton to the White House and delivered two solid wins for Barack Obama before turning on the Democrats and giving Donald Trump 54 percent of its votes. Globalization stole many good-paying jobs from Macomb, leaving fertile ground for Trump’s anti-trade message. Democrat Debbie Dingell, who represents the Detroit area -- as her husband did before her, and his father before him – recalled to the Daily Beast how she confronted Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. \xa0“I told her in no uncertain terms, if you leave Michigan and people here don’t know you’re opposed to the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), and will be opposed to it when you’re president – You can just forget it,” Dingell said. She meant forget being president, which is what happened. Dingell still gets exercised over how her frantic calls for action then were ignored. “Anybody I talked to, I said it was a problem,” she recalled. “It was clearly a problem in Michigan. I was told not to worry, everything was fine.” Democrats were so confident the “blue wall” would hold that Clinton made just one trip to Michigan that August, telling workers at Futuramic Tool & Engineering in suburban Detroit that she was against TPP, and would be as president. It wasn’t reassuring, not with President Obama openly lobbying for the trade deal, telling naysayers it would get done in the lame duck Congress after the election. \xa0“Obama wanted it as a legacy issue, and that left her (Clinton) clearly muddled and jumbled,” \xa0Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg told the Daily Beast. “Trade was a major factor in Trump’s victory, and she was perceived to be ambivalent. She was so concerned with not appearing to have any distance from Obama on the economy.” “They voted for Obama because of economic self-interest, and they voted for Trump for the same reason.”According to Greenberg, Obama called into the platform committee before the Democratic Convention to change the wording to be less critical of TPP. Dingell was “apoplectic about TPP and Clinton not being clear,” says Greenberg, as was his wife, Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. The two women conveyed their anger to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, apparently to no avail. “I hate to be Debbie Downer again, but you can’t take this for granted,” says Dingell, sounding the alarm ahead of the November midterm elections for Democrats to up their game. “You don’t know how many people will stay home out of general disgust or think their vote doesn’t matter.” Greenberg shares her angst about Macomb. He has made a career out of monitoring attitudes in the working-class suburb. The insights he gleaned more than 25 years ago paved the way for Bill Clinton to reorient the Democratic Party more to the center, allowing a Democrat to win the White House after 12 years in the wilderness. The veteran pollster says Democrats don’t yet have a winning economic message that speaks to the real struggles people are having. Rising health care premiums top the list, he says. “I can’t tell you how powerful the health care issue is. People are in tears about the cost of health care, and they blame the Republicans.” The salience of the health care issue is a key takeaway from focus groups Greenberg conducted in March in Macomb with Trump voters and Detroit area base voters. He found that white college-graduate women “seemed as much a base, anti-Trump group as the African Americans.” Greenberg sees Macomb as a bellwether for the country. In 2008, these working-class voters supported Obama, making a judgment about him that transcended race, “that he wouldn’t just work for his own folks, he would work for everybody.”They voted for Obama because of economic self-interest, and they voted for Trump for the same reason. Working-class men in Macomb support Trump by two to one, and many have paid a high price for their vote in their own family. The politicized, polarized civil war in the country is in the family, says Greenberg, with older voters blaming the mainstream media’s “fake news” for their millennial children failing to understand what Trump is trying to do.

But he questions whether these evolving demographics are enough to return Democrats to power. “I’m not a big fan of the assumption that it will automatically translate into victory,” he said. “All these groups are struggling economically, and they’re desperate for an economic message that recognizes how much they’re struggling. “Clean up corrupt government is not enough for them. Identity politics are not enough,” he says. Asked what he thinks of the Democrats’ new slogan, Better Deal, he replies, “Not a fan of it.” The 1992 election that propelled Bill Clinton to the White House was famously staked on the phrase “It’s the economy, stupid.” Greenberg still thinks that has to be the bedrock message even with another month of positive job numbers released last Friday. People believe the economy is growing and more jobs are available, “but that has not diminished their frustration and insecurities about their stagnant pay in the face of rising costs,” Greenberg writes in his latest report on “Macomb and America’s New Political Moment.” Anti-Trump voters are consolidated and motivated, “and increasingly intent to vote,” Greenberg concludes. “They are seeking out tools and information to win arguments” and to convince themselves that Democrats have a vision that is about more than just reflexively resisting Trump. \xa0\xa0 It is a time unlike any other in recent history when the stakes are so elevated that both sides speak about a virtual civil war in the country, and in their own families. Anti-Trump voters are consolidated and motivated, “and are increasingly intent to vote,” Greenberg says. “They are seeking out tools and information to win arguments,” and to convince themselves that Democrats learned from the last election and have a vision for the economy, and for the country, that is about more than Trump.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The modest three-bedroom brick house at 2326 Lakewood Drive in Kennesaw, Georgia, was acquired seven years ago by a FedEx employee turned fraudster at a rigged auction on the steps of the Cobb County Courthouse. Auctions of foreclosed homes were held on the steps every Tuesday, and this particular one, on Dec. 6, 2011, seemed notable only because of the unusually warm weather. Otherwise, the routine was the same, with fraudster Jeffrey Wayne Brock, or one of his representatives, conspiring with two \xa0fellow fraudsters named David Doughty and Stanley Sullivan not to bid competitively. Wayne was thereby able to acquire properties at little more than the minimum bid. He then rewarded the other two men with payoffs for having refrained from bidding against him.According to the government sentencing memorandum from when Brock was sent to federal prison for a scheme involving numerous rigged auctions, the payoff for the Lakewood Drive house was $3,770. The memorandum notes that the actual payoff money in all Brock’s crooked auctions came not from Brock himself but from investors who bankrolled his acquisition of foreclosed houses. He or, in his absence, his representative provided the investor invoices for what were described as “finder’s fees.”“Brock did not use his own money to pay Doughty and Sullivan for not bidding competitively at the December 6, 2011 auctions; rather, he used money that outside investors had given him to acquire foreclosed properties,” the memorandum says, “To keep his investors informed, Brock instructed an employee to send them invoices documenting the payments that he made.” The employee dutifully prepared an invoice documenting a $3,770 payoff for the Lakewood house. The sum seems altogether reasonable considering that county records show Brock paid only $21,130 for a house that had been purchased back in 1999 for $95,000 and subsequently carried a mortgage of $155,000. The memorandum does not identify the investor who provided the payoff funds. Property records show that title to the house did pass from Brock to a Cobb County entity called The First Real Estate Corporation, though no purchase price is recorded and the property passed that very same day to one of Sean Hannity’s myriad shell companies, SPMKX GA LL.Hannity denies without equivocation that he has ever been an investor of any of Brock’s endeavors. Christopher Reeves, the registered agent for 21 of Hannity’s SPMK companies, told The Daily Beast in an email, “No entity in which Mr. Hannity held any direct or indirect interest was an investor with Mr. Brock or any entity associated with him.”And that\xa0seems to make sense. Hannity has said he did not get involved in the details of his many transactions. And why would a guy who makes millions as a TV and radio commentator and was reportedly on the way to assembling a real-estate empire that the Guardian estimates to include more than 870 properties in seven states take such a risk for a relatively small score?Even so, however innocent he may be of actual wrongdoing, Hannity remains the beneficiary of a crooked scheme. Records show Hannity paid $54,000 for a house worth double that amount. Whoever paid the payoff, the outcome of this deal is so messy you might think that Michael Cohen was involved. There is no indication that he had anything to do with it.One role Cohen did play in the present fuss over Hannity’s holdings came after the commentator was identified in Manhattan Federal Court as one of the self-proclaimed fixer’s three clients. The obvious possibility was that Cohen had tried to hush up a potential sex scandal with Hannity—work the attorney had done on behalf of his other two clients. Hannity was quick to say Cohen had only helped him with some real estate matters.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.That seems to be what prompted Jon Swaine of the Guardian to look into what real estate matters those might have been. Swaine seems not to have come up with any immediate revelations concerning Cohen, but he did determine Hannity had an empire in the making that involved a host of shell companies.Hannity had acquired at least 11 properties through Brock, many at the weekly auction on the Cobb County courthouse steps. A records check showed that Brock had pleaded guilty to federal bid rigging and fraud charges in 2016.Along with describing how the investors provided the payoffs to secure a purchase price far below the actual value, the sentencing memorandum notes, “For the homeowner victims, these thefts occurred at a low point in their lives.”The memorandum continues, “The money that Brock and his conspirators kept for themselves could have helped the victims get back on their feet, but Brock instead enriched himself.”After his arrest, Brock quickly agreed to cooperate. The prosecutors argued in the memorandum that Brock was nonetheless “deserving of a 15-month sentence.” Judge Mark Cohen, no relation to the fixer, gave him only six.The unidentified investors who provided the payoffs were never brought to account. That includes whoever provided the $3,770 payoff for the house at 2326 Lakewood Drive.There is also the question of the 10 other foreclosed houses that Brock had purchased at sub-bargain prices and then conveyed to Hannity through various companies.That is without going into Hannity’s unrelated purchase of two Georgia apartment complexes on a single day for a total of $22.7 million, with $17.9 million of that paid through a loan insured by a helpful HUD. The use of HUD funding and the foreclosure purchases do not sit well with folks you might initially figure to be Hannity fans. These include Ray Gilreath, the 84-year-old Air Force retiree who raised a family in the Lakewood Drive house, which he owned for three decades before he sold it to the folks who subsequently lost it when they defaulted on the mortgage. “For some reason, I have no use for him,” Gilreath said of Hannity when contacted by The Daily Beast on Tuesday. Gilreath suggested, “I think he takes advantage of poor people.”Gilreath was hardly pleased to learn that Hannity now owns the house that was his home for so long.“If I was a criminal, I’d go burn that thing down,” Gilreath said.Of course, Gilreath is so displeased in the first place only because he is anything but a criminal. He possesses an actual sense of right and wrong. "},
 {'title': 'Congress Snuck New Russia Sanctions Into Spending Bill',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Buried in the massive $1.3 trillion spending bill that Congress is considering this week are strict new punishments against Russia, in what lawmakers and aides say is a message to President Donald Trump to reconsider his relaxed posture toward Moscow.The legislation, which Trump was always expected to sign, includes restrictions that bar many federal agencies from engaging financially or otherwise with the Kremlin and its backers on a number of fronts. Lawmakers from both parties viewed those provisions and others as an opportunity to enshrine new punishments against Vladimir Putin’s regime at a time when the Trump administration has taken heat for its refusal to immediately and fully implement mandatory sanctions and other punishments.“Those [sanctions] were a good first step. But I do think that these newer sanctions hopefully put a little more bite to it. And frankly I think that’s a good thing,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) told The Daily Beast. “The Russians are guilty of bad behavior all over the world. And so we shouldn’t be doing anything to encourage or condone that.”The new measures come as the White House faces renewed criticism over its handling of Russia. Earlier this week, The Washington Post reported that the president, against the advice of his top aides, congratulated Putin on winning re-election to another six-year term. He also did not press Putin on election-meddling or on the nerve-agent attack on a former Russian spy in the United Kingdom. Multiple lawmakers and congressional sources from both parties said the new financial barriers aimed at punishing Russia are both robust and significant, and were crafted in light of Russia’s continued aggression in eastern Europe and the Middle East in addition to the likelihood that the Kremlin tries to meddle in the 2018 midterm elections.Democrats pointed to Trump’s reluctance to publicly criticize Putin and speak out about Russia’s activities, and said it was necessary for Congress to step in whenever possible to send the administration a message.“With the appropriations bill, bipartisan majorities are once again sending the president tough new measures to push back on Russia and shore up our election system against future interference,” Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Daily Beast. “It’s time that the White House listens to Congress and uses the tools we’ve provided.”The spending bill bars the use of federal funds for “enter[ing] into new contracts with, or new agreements for Federal assistance to, the Russian Federation,” and allocates $250 million to the Countering Russian Influence Fund—a 150 percent increase from last year. Additionally, it authorizes significant new sanctions against Russia over its actions in eastern Europe and the Middle East.Their origin, though, remains a mystery. While lawmakers were unsure who exactly inserted those measures into the 2,232-page spending bill, they said it represented a broad point of agreement among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill in a policy area where Trump himself has, in their view, struggled.“I think there is broad bipartisan concern that our president hasn’t been active in pushing back against Russian aggression—either its meddling in our last election and likely meddling in our next election, or its aggression toward its neighbors like Ukraine, Georgia and its interference in Syria,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told The Daily Beast.Coons, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the language was “most likely added by senior senators who recognize that the Congress has acted forcefully and in a bipartisan way to demand sanctions and stronger action by the president and [we] have so far been largely disappointed. I think this is partly an effort of senior legislators from both parties to make progress on that.”Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) described the spending bill as a “wheelbarrow” of Congress’ priorities, and said he suspects the additional measures were included “in response to what’s been going on up here,” referring to mandatory sanctions against Russia that continue to receive bipartisan backing.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Because it’s an omnibus appropriations bill, that’s the logical place for that type of language to be,” Isakson said.Despite Trump’s apparent unwillingness to outwardly criticize Putin and Moscow’s election-meddling practices, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have credited the Trump administration for taking actions against the Kremlin including a new lethal defensive weapons sale to Ukraine’s military, which is defending itself against Russian-backed separatists.The omnibus includes financial punishments against Russia over its annexation of Crimea, which the U.S. and its allies have condemned. The legislation also includes a five-page section titled “Countering Russian Influence and Aggression,” which outlines specification prohibitions on federal dollars going to the Russian government.Additionally, federal agencies are barred from directing financial assistance toward countries that are supporting Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The bill also restricts federal agencies from investing in Crimea or other areas that the U.S. believes are under illegal control by Russia, and requires Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to direct Americans sitting on international financial boards to vote against any measure that funds programs which violate “the sovereignty or territorial integrity of Ukraine.”More broadly, the legislation directs funds toward “supporting democracy programs” in Russia including Internet freedom. It also allocates $380 million to the Election Assistance Commission to help states and localities improve their election infrastructure to guard it against cyberattacks. The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a series of recommendations this week on election security as part of its Russia investigation.“It is reassuring that at least in this bill, we still have a bipartisan consensus with regard to national security issues,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) told The Daily Beast, speculating that Congress was aiming to “protect [Trump] from himself” by slipping in new punishments against Putin."},

 {'title': 'Stormy Daniels Files Defamation Lawsuit Against Trump',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As her attorney promised, porn star Stormy Daniels has filed a defamation suit against President Trump over his comments about a mystery man who allegedly threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011. The unidentified goon allegedly warned Daniels, “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,” after she spoke to In Touch about her alleged romp with the future president. (The magazine didn’t run Daniels’ interview until this year, when her $130,000 hush agreement, brokered by Trump’s lawyer, became national news.)Daniels appeared on ABC’s The View two weeks ago to unveil a forensic sketch of the man who allegedly bullied her into silence. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, offered a $100,000 reward for anyone who could identify “the thug.”The next day, Trump took to Twitter to bash Daniels’ police sketch, which was created by renowned forensic artist Lois Gibson, as “a total con job” about “a nonexistent man.” His tweet was in response to a Trump supporter’s post, which showed side-by-side images of the sketch and a photo of Daniels’ husband. “Mr. Trump’s statement falsely attacks the veracity of Ms. Clifford’s account of the threatening incident that took place in 2011,” Daniels’ newest lawsuit states, adding that Trump’s statement accuses her of criminal activity: specifically, falsely accusing someone of committing a crime when no such crime occurred. The federal complaint, filed in New York on Monday, comes after a California judge delayed Daniels’ other lawsuit against Trump and his embattled attorney, Michael Cohen. In that case, Daniels wants to void the nondisclosure agreement she inked with Cohen in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election, and she’s filed a defamation claim against Cohen, too.Last week Friday, U.S. District Judge James Otero granted Cohen a 90-day stay of Daniels’ case because of the criminal probe Cohen faces in New York—an inquiry that focuses, in part, on his $130,000 payout to the porn actress. Avenatti announced the latest defamation filing on Twitter.“Moments ago, we filed this lawsuit against Mr. Trump for his recent irresponsible and defamatory statements about my client @stormydaniels,” Avenatti wrote. “He is well aware of what transpired and his complicity. We fully intend on bringing it to light.”Avenatti teased the specter of a claim against the commander in chief on April 20, telling reporters that Trump “effectively called my client a liar and stated that she was trying to pull a con on the American people.”“I very much look forward to placing Mr. Trump under oath and asking him about the basis for those outlandish, outrageous, baseless statements,” Avenatti said, following a court appearance in Los Angeles for Daniels’ case against Cohen. The lawsuit reiterates what Daniels has said publicly—in her 60 Minutes interview and during her live appearance on The View—about the frightening encounter.

It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom,” said the man, who peered at Daniels’ infant daughter and walked off.“Ms. Clifford was shaken by the experience and understood the man’s statement to be a direct threat,” her lawsuit states. “Because Ms. Clifford was frightened, however, she did not go to the police and did not seek to go public with her story at that time.” She didn’t want the disclosure of the Trump affair to affect her relationship, the complaint says. The lawsuit suggests Trump and Cohen sent the thug after Daniels. “Given the circumstances surrounding the threatening incident in 2011, namely that Ms. Clifford had not at the time gone public with her story and very few people knew of the possible In Touch story, it is reasonable to infer that the person who threatened Ms. Clifford could have only been acting directly or indirectly on behalf of Mr. Trump and/or Mr. Cohen,” court papers allege.“Thus, Mr. Trump may have actual knowledge of the incident and of the falsity of his statement,” the complaint adds.If the president didn’t have any connection to the incident, he still “chose to defame and disparage Ms. Clifford to his audience of over 50 million Twitter followers and many more worldwide,” the lawsuit states.Because of Trump’s tweet, Daniels has faced death threats and “other threats of physical violence,” her lawsuit says. She’s also hired bodyguards since her public battle with Trump and loyal fixer has raged on.Daniels has suffered damages in excess of $75,000, her lawsuit states. She’s seeking a jury trial and compensatory and punitive damages."},
 {'title': 'President Trump Continues Attack on Tester: I Know Things That Would End His Career',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump, having elected to skip the White House Correspondents’ Dinner for the second year in a row, continued on Saturday evening to train his ire on Senator Jon Tester (D-MT), who he blames for derailing the nomination of White House physician Ronny Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. “Tester started throwing out things that he’s heard. Well, I know things about Tester that I could say, too,” Trump threatened at a rally in Washington Township, Michigan. “And if I said them, he’d never be elected again.” (Trump did not say what these things were). Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate veterans’ affairs committee, contended this past week that there his office had been told of numerous allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior by Jackson, including excessive drinking on the job and over-prescribing medications. Those accusations led Jackson to withdraw his nomination for the position. While President Trump has singled out Tester, both in a series of morning tweets on Saturday and at his rally, for upending the nomination process, several Republican senators involved in the vetting process told The Daily Beast that the White House had not done a good enough job preparing Jackson for the nomination. Tester had the support of his colleague, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), in investigating the allegations, but only the Montana Democrat, who is up for re-election this year, was singled out for Trump’s wrath. “What Jon Tester did to this man is a disgrace,” Trump said. Earlier on Saturday, Trump tweeted that the Secret Service had found the allegations previously released by Tester’s staff to be untrue. What the Secret Service actually said on Friday, however, was that they had no record of a specific allegation, first reported by CNN, which claimed that during an overseas trip in 2015, Jackson drunkenly banged on the door of a female colleague to the point at which agents had to calm him down. "Over the last 48 hours, media outlets have alleged that U.S. Secret Service personnel were forced to intervene during a Presidential foreign travel assignment in order to prevent disturbing (former) President Barack Obama,” the Secret Service said in a statement. “The Secret Service has no such record of any incident; specifically, any incident involving Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson.” Separately on Friday, the White House said a review of Jackson’s vehicle records found no indication that he “wrecked” a car after drinking at a Secret Service party, a claim that was included in the release of allegations from the Senate. “The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being,” Trump tweeted on Saturday. “Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!”Tester is one of ten Senate Democrats up for reelection in November in states that President Trump won in 2016. Throughout the rest of the president’s free-wheeling address, he discussed how much he likes French President Emmanuel Macron, said that Republicans would retain the majority in the House of Representatives in November and, of course, referenced Kanye West.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Donald Trump really is a big-tent Republican, at least in term of bigots and racists. If you hate a minority group, you are very welcome inside Trump’s tent. \xa0There are the white supremacists in Charlottesville whom he defended as \xa0“very fine people.” And people like former KKK grand wizard David Duke who have openly praised Trump many times, including last November with this tweet after Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos: “Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!”Speaking of anti-Muslim activists, they are all in for Trump. After all, their allies John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are part of the Trump administration. Plus we can’t forget the right-wing, white evangelical leaders like Robert Jeffress who love Trump while spewing anti-LGBT and anti-Mormon hate. \xa0It’s like Trump is bringing together an “Avengers” of hate-filled bigots who all fight on his side. And now we can expand that tent of hate to include Louis Farrakhan. Yep, the despicably anti-Semitic spewing leader of the Nation of Islam is now praising Trump. And the reason he’s touting Trump should be concerning for anyone actually who actually supports law enforcement, a robust media and, frankly, democracy. In an interview published Friday, Farrakhan exalted Trump for destroying their common enemies. As Farrakhan explained, “The nature of this administration is good for us,” adding as a compliment, “There’s never been a president quite like Mr. Trump.” \xa0Then Farrakhan spelled it out in detail: “Trump is destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise.” The 86-year-old Nation leader then asked rhetorically: “Who is the enemy of our rise?”Want to guess who Farrakhan views as his enemies? \xa0Interestingly, the very same enemies Trump sees as preventing his own “rise.” \xa0We are talking the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the media.   On the FBI, Farrakhan gleefully praised Trump’s efforts to destroy the legitimacy of this law enforcement agency saying: “Now, the FBI, go at it, baby. They’ve been beating the hell out of us ever since J. Edgar Hoover… So go ahead, Mr. Trump.”“The left must be lightyears better than the right when it comes to making it clear there’s zero tolerance for bigotry.”Farrakhan then slammed the Department of Justice, another Trump target, noting: “Is it the Department of Justice where we get none?”And on Trump’s favorite target, the media, Farrakhan again thanked Trump for undermining its credibility, noting: “Is it the media that has destroyed every Black leader that stood up for us calling us out of our name?” He then invoked Trump’s favorite phrase to delegitimize the media saying: “I know very well that we have been the victims of some ‘fake news.’”There you have it. Trump and his new BFF Farrakhan share common enemies of the media, FBI and DOJ. Why do these two both attack these guardrails of our democracy? In Trump’s case, his barbs are clearly designed to flatten these speed bumps on his way to authoritarianism. In Farrakhan’s case, it’s likely more about personal gain.So what has the right’s response been to Farrakhan openly praising Trump? You would think they would be quick to denounce any cheerleading by Farrakhan given his open anti-Semitism over the years. Farrakhan has publicly praised Hitler as “a very great man” \xa0and spewed hate of Jews, such as his speech in February where he equated Jews to Satan as well as declaring that, “Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.You would especially think the Trump and GOP would make it clear they want nothing to do with Farrakhan after they recently demanded the very same of Democrats who had any ties to him. \xa0In fact, many on the right were up in arms in January when an old photo from 2005 of Barack Obama simply standing next to Farrakhan surfaced. And after Farrakhan’s February speech, you heard Fox News demand a short time later: “Why aren't more Democrats condemning Louis Farrakhan?” Same with the national Republican Party which in March highlighted several Democratic members of Congress leaders who had any connections to the Nation’s leader and demanded to know why it wasn’t “bigger news?”In response, Democratic officials who did have connections to Farrakhan, even very remote, did publicly condemn Farrakhan’s history of hate. For example, Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif) tweeted bluntly: “I’ve spent my life fighting discrimination in every form, from anyone. I unequivocally condemn Minister Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic and hateful comments. This vitriol has no place in our society.” \xa0That’s the correct response to anti-Semitism or any form of bigotry. And it’s wrong \xa0that Tamika Mallory, one of the four amazing women who organized the Women’s March, has still not denounced Farrakhan’s hateful anti-Semitic words after attending his speech in February and, like Trump, being publicly praised by the Nation of Islam leader. The left must be lightyears better than the right when it comes to making it clear there’s zero tolerance for bigotry. Just look at how the right is responding to \xa0Farrakhan celebrating  Trump. We aren’t seeing a chorus of condemnation. In fact, we are seeing worse than silence as two visible conservatives actually praised Farrakhan for his words of support for Trump. Candace Owens, the spokesperson for the very pro-Trump organization “Turning Point USA” and frequent Fox News guest, took to Twitter to praise the significance of Farrakhan’s words: “In no way do I endorse Farrakhan’s views but holy crap this is a really big deal. He has just aligned himself with Trump’s administration. What is going on in the black community right now is unprecedented. Flag this. It’s relevant.”And then recent Trump convert Glenn Beck praised Owens’ assessment that Farrakhan’s praise of Trump is “huge.” But not a peep from either Beck or Owens about Farrakhan’s documented history of anti-Semitism. While over on Trump loving Breitbart, the headline declared “Louis Farrakhan on Trump: ‘He Is Destroying Our Enemies,” where they \xa0highlighted his support of Trump. Only in the very last paragraph of that article was Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism even mentioned--and then in passing at best.Calling out the right for a double standard is a fool’s errand. They truly have no shame in their hypocrisy. But we must do it so that we don’t normalize the bigotry and hatred that Trump and some of his supporters are spewing. \xa0Simply put: If we remain silent, the voices of hate – be they Trump, Farrakhan, Duke or others—win."},
 {'title': 'Kentucky Math Teacher Beats GOP House Leader Who Voted to Cut His Pension',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "High school math teacher R. Travis Brenda narrowly defeated Kentucky's Republican House Majority Floor Leader Jonathan Shell on Tuesday night—a stunning upset indicative of the political strength of teachers in the state. Brenda had never run for public office before his bid for the state’s 71st House District, but was animated by teacher angst against a pension bill signed into law back in April. Shell, according to the Lexington Herald Leader, played an instrumental role in getting the controversial reform measure passed in the legislature. The bill sparked a massive teacher protest in the state, on the heels of other teacher movements in states like West Virginia. Brenda said that he previously supported the state’s Republican Governor Matt Bevin, “but I won’t again. He has been way too strident against teachers and I can’t accept that.”And so Brenda ran in the Republican primary against the state house’s GOP leader, ultimately beating Shell by a narrow margin.The Kentucky Education Association had opposed the pension-cutting plan, which was passed by the legislature in late March without giving many people the opportunity to read it.  It stipulated that new teachers would be entered into a “hybrid” retirement plan that would combine elements of a traditional pension and 401(k) type savings plan. It also included a provision that would allow teachers to only use sick days towards their retirement that they accumulated through the end of 2018. Teachers were also incensed with the process of passing the legislation, which was tucked into a separate bill about sewage services. Bevin’s comments about the teachers’ strikes only made matters worse. “I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today, a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them,” the governor said at the time. “I guarantee you somewhere today, a child was physically harmed or ingested poison because they were left alone because a single parent didn’t have any money to take care of them.”He later apologized for the remarks, but the damage was already done.In a statement on his Facebook page after the win, Brenda said: “First and foremost, thanks go to God for His direction through this process. Thank you to all of those that have been a part of this campaign by helping knock on doors, putting up signs, sharing with friends and neighbors, and trusting me with your vote.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Allies and House Republicans to Paul Ryan: Get Out Now',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'House Speaker Paul Ryan’s retirement announcement Wednesday morning set off a round of heartburn within the White House and among its allies over the damage that may be done in what’s left of his term. And while publicly no lawmaker is yet discussing a push to get the speaker to leave early, certain quarters of the Republican Party and Capitol Hill want him out of Congress right away rather than in early 2019.“He’s not going to stick around. That’s not an option,” said one prominent GOP donor. “As a donor, would I ever give him a dollar if he’s not going to stay around? Fuck no…. We need someone with skin in the game who actually cares about the majority.”Sources inside the Trump White House tell The Daily Beast that their primary concern following Ryan’s announcement was that more fellow House Republicans would follow him to the exits, enhancing the likelihood that Democrats gain control of the chamber. That fear seemed at least partially realized when Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL) said that he too would be retiring from Congress minutes after the Ryan news broke.But the concerns extend beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and aren’t just about the possibility of GOP lawmaker exodus that may soon transpire. On the Hill, there is fear that a lame-duck speaker all but guarantees a legislative logjam, as no lawmaker will now feel compelled to take a tough vote at Ryan’s insistence. There is also an appetite within the Republican caucus to get new leadership in right away, with the front runners being Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA). “I don’t know what he was thinking. I think this was a huge miscalculation. I think this is the captain abandoning the sinking ship,” said former Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), who told The Daily Beast he’d been talking to his ex-colleagues about the Ryan news. “Members are pissed. I think this is going to cause some angst.”Ryan’s office did not return a request for comment.Ryan pledged on Wednesday to “run through the tape, to finish the year.” And Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters that he knew of “no efforts to make him leave sooner than that."But others don’t see that as politically tenable, with one GOP congressional aide noting that “Eric Cantor had committed to staying through the end in 2014, too,” only to leave earlier. “There’s a natural discomfort with the idea of a leadership member hanging on for several months as a lame duck,” the aide said. Untethered from the political pressures, Ryan could feel emboldened to now push a legislative agenda contrary to the White House’s primary interests. That could include a piece of immigration legislation that is more generous to so-called DREAMers — undocumented minors brought to the country by their parents — than President Donald Trump is comfortable with or even a bill that would shield special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired by the president.“There’s a good reason people in DC say if you want to make someone behave the way you want, keep them in a job where they have to play ball with you or answer to you for as long as possible,” said GOP strategist Liz Mair, who is close to Ryan. “Ryan is no longer in quite that position, and his view of what is in America’s best interest has never truly aligned with Trump’s— nor do his core values as a human being. That makes this a big risk for the White House."But not everyone sees Ryan going down this route because, among other relevant factors, the speaker has shown little overt ideological affinity for some of these items. Despite critical words aimed at Trump and “bigotry” during the 2016 campaign, Ryan has been a reliable partner for the White House since January 2017. If anything, he’s been the most instrumental lawmaker in shepherding his agenda, from dismissing criticism over the president’s temperamental tweets to allowing the House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russia’s election meddling to become an exercise in partisan defensiveness.

Jack Kingston (R-GA), an ally and media surrogate of President Trump’s.Kingston went on to predict that, ultimately, Ryan would remain relatively benign during his lame-duck period, neither pursuing wayward legislative ideas or becoming a vocal Trump critic. It’s a view shared with many senior staffers in the Trump White House, who noted that keeping his exalted status in the Republican Party is dependent on it. “He has always been a team player,” Kingston said, of Ryan. “Remember, he was a congressional staffer. He likes the institution, whereas [Trump critic Sen. Jeff] Flake as a House member liked to attack Republican earmarks and never was a team player.”'},

  'body': "What do Diamond & Silk and Chick-fil-A have in common? According to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), they’ve been targeted by Facebook’s liberal bias.The conservative senator on Tuesday raised concerns about the political lean of Facebook while CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat in front of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committee. “Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum?” Cruz asked at the outset. When the Facebook founder gave what the senator apparently deemed an unsatisfactory answer, he interrupted: “It’s just a simple question… Do you consider yourself a neutral public forum? Or are you engaged in political speech, which is your right under the First Amendment?”Zuckerberg replied: “Our goal is not to engage in political speech.”An antagonistic Cruz then asked Zuckerberg why specific conservative voices have allegedly been suppressed, or shut down, on the social platform.“There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,” Cruz told the social-media titan. “Facebook routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including stories about CPAC… about Mitt Romney… about the Lois Lerner IRS scandal… about Glenn Beck. In addition to that, Facebook has initially shut down the ‘Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day’ page, has blocked posts of a Fox News reporter, has blocked over two-dozen Catholic pages.”The senator then claimed that Facebook has recently “blocked Trump supporters Diamond & Silk's page, with 1.2 million Facebook followers, after determining their content and brand were, quote, ‘unsafe to the community.’”In response, Zuckerberg said that Facebook is located in Silicon Valley, “an extremely left-leaning place” by his own admission. “I try to root out in the company is making sure we don’t have any bias in the work we do and I think it is a fair concern that people would wonder about,” he added.Diamond & Silk are a pair of flamboyant and very public Trump surrogates, who began their career as YouTube stars—often publishing videos like a “Trump’s Yo President” rap and landing frequent Fox & Friends appearances.Trump has noticed their devotion, lauding them as “two truly fantastic women!” One senior administration official told The Daily Beast that the duo are practically “senior economic advisers to” the president.During Tuesday’s hearing, Cruz pressed onward, asking why Facebook hasn’t censored the pages of liberal organizations like MoveOn.org or “any Democrat running for office.” He then asked Zuckerberg if his company knows the political orientation of employees tasked with reviewing content. “No, we do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they're joining the company,” the Facebook founder replied.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Luckey was the founder of Oculus VR, which was bought by Facebook. Months after his meme machine was outed, Luckey departed the company altogether.“Why was Palmer Luckey fired?” Cruz asked.Zuckerberg replied: “That is a specific personnel matter that would seem like it would be inappropriate to speak to here.”Cruz continued to grill him, claiming he “just made a specific representation that you didn’t make decisions based on political views.”“Well, I can commit that it was not because of a political view,” Zuckerberg said.

 {'title': 'Pentagon Sucks the Air Out of Trump’s ‘Mission Accomplished’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Almost as soon as Donald Trump declared “mission accomplished” in Syria, the Pentagon dialed the claim back substantially. In reviewing the Pentagon’s assessment of what U.S. warplanes and cruise missiles did last night to three suspected chemical storage and production facilities, U.S. defense representatives defined success in the most tactical of terms. That formulation resolved none of the relevant questions over the ultimate impact of a strike that Trump ordered after a substantially similar one last year failed to deter Bashar Assad from launching a chemical attack. But the Pentagon claimed tactical success. Unlike last year’s 59-Tomahawk-missile fusillade, no Tomahawks malfunctioned. Syria’s vaunted air defenses along the Mediterranean coast failed to shoot down any U.S. hardware, despite Russian claims of interception. (Though, for good measure, the U.S. launched most of Friday’s Tomahawks from ships in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and its B-1 bombers fired missiles with a 620-mile range.) Most of the 40 Syrian interceptor missiles launched after the U.S. cruise missiles had already struck their targets. And a threat from a Russian diplomat to target American ships proved empty.“We met our objectives,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, pressed on the president’s proclamation. “It was mission accomplished.”But the objective of the mission wasn’t to hit three Syrian chemical sites in and of themselves. It was, like last year’s strike on the Shayrat airfield, to deter Assad from future chemical attacks. And that depends on calculations that last night’s strike won’t resolve. Last year, for instance, Assad held off chemical attacks for a whole three months – resuming them, conspicuously, after Trump and his then-secretary of state signaled that they would work with Russia on a political resolution to the Syrian civil war and back away from a demand Assad relinquish power.“We did the same strike last year,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the intelligence committee. “He still used chemical weapons on his own people. Why would this be different?” Assad retains the capability to do so, the Pentagon conceded. While White said Assad’s ability to produce a chemical arsenal was “crippled,” her Joint Staff colleague, Lt. Gen. Frank McKenzie acknowledged, “I would not say they’d be unable to conduct a chemical attack in the future.” The strikes, McKenzie added, ought to make Assad “think twice” before doing so. That calculation remains outside the U.S.’ control. Assad’s hold on power is guaranteed by sponsors Russia and Iran, who are now diplomatically supported by America’s NATO ally Turkey in retaliation for Washington’s sponsorship of Ankara’s Kurdish enemies. The Syrians sent signals almost immediately after the strike that they considered it a flesh wound. Nor could the administration sing from the same sheet music about what the strikes actually represent. Trump called them the inauguration of a “sustained” campaign, but his defense secretary, James Mattis, said they were “right now” a “one-off.” At the Pentagon on Saturday morning, the message was that any follow-on depends on Assad’s behavior. And that underscored the groundhog-day dynamic of the latest strikes. Hit too little and Assad shrugs off the impact. Hit too much and risk a frightening escalation with the nuclear power backing Assad. McKenzie wouldn’t describe any high-level conversations between the Pentagon and the Russian foreign ministry, but reminded: “We don’t want to get into a fight with them, they don’t want to get into a fight with us.” Beyond the strikes themselves, the Trump administration has not decided on its objectives on Syria – beyond a proximate defeat of Islamic State, which is unrelated to the fate of Assad – let alone a strategy to achieve them. The day before the strikes, Mattis testified that the U.S. still wants to “not engage in the civil war itself,” but “at times, you’re going to see some contrary impulses.” White reiterated U.S. support for a diplomatic process in Syria that appears far less relevant than the one led by the Moscow-Tehran-Ankara bloc. It may then be only a matter of time before Trump’s strike cycle repeats. Easier to declare the mission accomplished once the missiles impact.

 {'title': 'Trump to Appoint Dr. Oz, Bill Belichick to Health Council',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Some famous faces—and questionable reputations—are joining President Donald Trump’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.On Friday afternoon, Trump announced that he plans to appoint New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and Dr. Mehmet Oz to his council. Belichick is a known Trump supporter, and Dr. Oz is most famous for his daytime talk show, The Dr. Oz Show.Belichick, Oz, and 18 others—including an NBC executive, the chief executive officer of SlimFast, and a Boys & Girls Clubs of America executive—will be appointed to the president’s council “for a term of two years,” according to a White House release. Oz, an Ivy League-educated cardiac surgeon, rose to fame after being a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, for whom he dispensed medical advice. He also penned the book You: The Owner’s Manual, along with various other spin-off books.But the content of his Emmy-winning talk show has been questioned by medical professionals. Researchers found that “nearly 4 in 10 of the assertions made on the hit show appear to be made on the basis of no evidence at all,” according to The Los Angeles Times. Of the evidence that was based on medical fact, 32 percent was deemed to be “general medical advice,” while 25 percent focused on diet, and 18 percent focused on weight loss.In 2015, 10 physicians called for Columbia University to boot Oz from his role as a “senior administrative position in the Department of Surgery” at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, according to NBC News.“Dr. Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgements about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both,” the group of doctors wrote in their letter to the university. “Whatever the nature of his pathology, members of the public are being misled and endangered, which makes Dr. Oz’s presence on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution unacceptable.”Dr. Oz responded to his critics, insisting that The Dr. Oz Show was “not a medical show” in a 2015 interview with NBC News. He stated that the purpose of his show is “not to talk about medicine,” while admitting “there are segments that I made that I wish I could take back.” Despite the letter, Dr. Oz remains employed at Columbia.Congress has also taken aim at the miraculous weight-loss solutions Dr. Oz has prominently featured on his show. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee invited Oz to testify “on the danger of over-the-counter diet pills,” but grilled him on the “miracle” methods and products he’s hawked, The Washington Post reported.“People want to believe you can take an itty-bitty pill to push fat out of your body,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) said to Oz during the hearing. “The scientific community is almost monolithically against you.”Green coffee bean extract was also touted by Oz as the next big breakthrough in weight loss. Oz went on television to laud the treatment, claiming the pill would make people lose up to “a pound a week.”Too good to be true? Yes. The Federal Trade Commission won a $3.5 million settlement against the extract manufacturer in 2014, and a 2012 Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy journal study promoting its health benefits was retracted. The FTC called the study “so hopelessly flawed that no reliable conclusions could be drawn from it.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': '‘Infuriated’ Jared Kushner Lost His Cool When Russians Didn’t Deliver Hillary Dirt',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Jared Kushner became “agitated” and “infuriate[d]” at the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting when a Kremlin-connected lawyer droned on about U.S. sanctions, instead of delivering on a promise to provide damaging information on Hillary Clinton. That’s according to Rob Goldstone, a British music promoter and friend of the Trumps who helped set up the meeting between Natalia Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr.—and who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Trump Tower confab.Goldstone’s testimony stands in contrast to what Kushner said in public about the meeting. In a July 2017 statement, Kushner paints himself as bored and confused by Veselnitskaya’s presentation. "I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting,” he told the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia inquiry, adding that he texted an assistant and asked for a call on his cell phone to excuse himself from the meeting. But Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee concluded in their final report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that Kushner, along with Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, "had expected to receive—but did not ultimately obtain—derogatory information on candidate Clinton" during the meeting.Goldstone, for his part, testified that Kushner became visibly angry when Veselnitskaya delivered a lengthy diatribe about U.S. sanctions on Russia and their impact on adoptions—instead of handing over dirt on Clinton.“After a few minutes of this labored presentation, Jared Kushner, who is sitting next to me, appeared somewhat agitated by this and said, I really have no idea what you\'re talking about. Could you please focus a bit more and maybe just start again?” Goldstone recalled of the meeting according to hearing transcripts released by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. “And I recall that she began the presentation exactly where she had begun it last time, almost word for word, which seemed, by his body language, to infuriate him even more.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the discrepancy in recollections.“Kushner denied knowing what the meeting was about—despite being copied on the email chain with the subject line, ‘Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.’”Goldstone told the Judiciary Committee that Aras Agalorov, the father of one of Goldstone’s clients, had met with a “well-connected Russian attorney” who offered “some interesting information that could potentially be damaging regarding funding by Russians to the Democrats and to its candidate, Hillary Clinton.”In a subsequent email to pitch the Trump campaign on a meeting, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that Russia’s prosecutor general had met with Aras Agalorov and “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” Goldstone further promised that it was “obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\'s support for Mr. Trump helped along by Aras and Emin [Agalarov]." Emin Agalorov, a popular singer in Russia and a client of Goldstone, and his father Aras, a Russian billionaire with connections to the Kremlin, helped set up the Trump Tower meeting with Veselnitskaya.In his statement on the Trump Tower meeting, Kushner denied knowing any of this—despite being copied on the email chain with the subject line, “Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.” Kushner said his knowledge of the meeting’s topic stemmed from having “quickly reviewed on my iPhone” an email from Donald Trump Jr. inviting him to a meeting scheduled only as “Don Jr.| Jared Kushner." Goldstone appeared to be chastened by the failure to deliver on his promised Clinton dirt after the meeting and apologized to Donald Trump Jr. “I said to him, Don, I really want to apologize. This was hugely embarrassing. I have no idea what this meeting was actually about,” he told the Senate Russia inquiry. '},
 {'title': 'GOP Senators: Unprepared White House Left Ronny Jackson ‘Out There by Himself’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The White House never thought Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson’s nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs would get out of hand so quickly.But Republicans directly involved with the chaotic process from the beginning were less surprised.On paper, Jackson, the White House physician, appeared to be a competent nominee even though lawmakers were concerned he lacked some key qualifications for the position.Jackson served as the top doctor to three presidents. His FBI background file was clean. And although he might not have had the managerial experience necessary to run a behemoth like the VA, he was lauded by presidents from both parties as a consummate professional.Then came the allegations of professional misconduct ranging from drinking on the job to improperly doling out medications. By the time the White House triage began, it was already over.Jackson denied the claims, but withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday. He was back at work at the White House the same day.Republican senators examining Jackson’s nomination described on Thursday a White House strategy that was unorganized at best, and negligent at worst—from start to finish. To the lawmakers and staffers who were directly involved in the confirmation process, the incomplete vetting of Jackson was just one of many strategic failures on the part of the administration.“They weren’t ready to go when the selection occurred. So they didn’t have a whole team lined up all ready to come in,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said in an interview.“In this case, they moved him very quickly,” Rounds added. “And I think what probably happened was they assumed that because he was already in the White House and he had gone through the vetting process for security purposes, that he would be a safe, very quick and rapidly approvable individual because of the security reviews he’s already gone through.”The Daily Beast spoke with more than a dozen GOP senators who outlined a host of problems with the White House’s strategy in pushing Jackson through, from the initial vetting process to what they viewed as an inadequate response to the allegations when they first surfaced.Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs chief who spearheaded the Jackson nomination, told The Daily Beast that it was “disheartening that the Senate would choose to disparage” Jackson “based on unsubstantiated allegations.”Late last week, committee members were first informed of the allegations against Jackson, which came from more than 20 military employees who worked with the rear admiral. Those allegations included being drunk on the job, over-prescribing medications, verbally abusing staffers, and drunkenly crashing a government vehicle. By Tuesday, the committee had indefinitely postponed Jackson’s confirmation hearing, which was scheduled to take place the next day, while they looked into the accusations.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The White House was caught completely off guard, according to lawmakers and Capitol Hill aides from both parties who were directly involved in the confirmation process.“I don’t know whether the allegations are true, but I presume in a vetting process before a nomination, people go around and find out if there’s anyone who’s going to make such allegations. And if someone makes such allegations, you’re prepared for them and have a rebuttal. As opposed to them kind of sneaking out and being caught off guard,” Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), a member of the veterans’ affairs committee, said in an interview.Cassidy said the White House’s nomination process amounted to “not enough preparation and understanding that there were people who were going to come out with these allegations.” By Tuesday night, the White House was playing defense. The press office had blasted out hand-written notes from Trump and former President Barack Obama praising Jackson’s work. A senior administration official dismissed the source of the allegations as “a bitter ex-colleague.” Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), the top Democrat on the veterans’ affairs committee, told The Daily Beast that Jackson’s FBI file “appeared fine.”Trump himself was also defending Jackson, but he openly questioned the idea of him staying the course amid the hand-wringing process and “abuse” he was enduring. But while the president blamed congressional vetters, those lawmakers said it was the White House that didn’t do its due diligence from start to finish.“I don’t think the preparation for the announcement of the nomination was done. And once it was made, I feel like he was hung out there by himself,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), the number-two Republican in the Senate, said in an interview. “There needs to be work done with Congress to make sure that there’s going to be more than just the nominee himself or herself out there defending themselves against unfair attacks, but also advocating on behalf of the nomination.”Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), a Trump ally who hasn’t been afraid to criticize the administration, said it appeared to him and his colleagues that the White House was “surprised about the allegations,” adding that “either someone didn’t do his job or made a mistake in doing the vetting.”“A proper background examination doesn’t always turn up the stuff a nominee gets hit with. But it can find 90 percent,” he added.Jackson’s confirmation process angered GOP lawmakers who have grown increasingly frustrated with the White House and the president over the revolving door of high-level staff departures, creating confirmation battles that none of them necessarily want to wage. While many of them have remained hesitant to outwardly criticize Trump for forcing them through politically charged Cabinet-level confirmations in an election year, this week appeared to be a turning point.“Hopefully [the new VA nominee] won’t be a current Cabinet member, because we don’t need two more vacancies to fill,” said Cornyn."},
 {'title': 'Inside the Mysterious Intelligence Firm Now in Mueller’s Sights',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In the fall of 2016, Donald Trump Jr. and other key aides to the future president reportedly met in Trump Tower with Joel Zamel, the founder of a company called Wikistrat.Wikistrat bills itself as a “crowdsourced” geopolitical analysis firm based in Washington, D.C. But interviews with current and former employees and documents reviewed by The Daily Beast tell a different story: that the vast majority of Wikistrat’s clients were foreign governments; that Wikistrat is, for all intents and purposes, an Israeli firm; and that the company’s work was not just limited to analysis. It also engaged in intelligence collection.Robert Mueller’s office is investigating Wikistrat and Zamel, according to The Wall Street Journal, as the special counsel’s probe expands into Middle Eastern governments’ attempts to influence American politics.Publicly, Wikistrat touts its crowdsourcing interface it has described as “Wikipedia meets Facebook” to develop reports for clients. The documents also highlight Wikistrat’s heavy reliance on “gamification”—applying game design features to encourage user engagement—to solicit information from sources. Former Wikistrat employees say its founder viewed himself as the Mark Zuckerberg of the national-security world.But despite the firm’s purported commitment to “transparent, open-source methodologies,” the documents provided to The Daily Beast show something different: that the company exploits “in country… informants” as sources. Wikistrat’s “About” page includes mention of “on-the-ground collection.”And according to internal Wikistrat documents marked “highly confidential and sensitive material,” 74 percent of the firm’s revenue came from clients that were foreign governments. Although Wikistrat’s clients were overwhelmingly foreign governments, the company boasted incredible access to top U.S. military and intelligence officials. The firm’s advisory council lists former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael Hayden, former national security adviser James L. Jones, former deputy director of the National Security Council Elliott Abrams, and former acting director of the Defense Intelligence Agency David Shedd, among others.Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that the company’s website is adorned with the insignias of U.S. military agencies and that it claims D.C. as its headquarters. But exactly how much of a connection these advisers have with the company isn’t totally clear. “I have always been informal… but I support the concept of their work (as my quote [on Wikistrat’s website] points out),” Hayden told The Daily Beast in an email. “There is no paperwork between us and I have never been to a board meeting.”A former senior analyst for Wikistrat, James Kadtke, described his experience with the company to The Daily Beast. A physicist by training, Kadtke worked as a defense and technology adviser to Sen. John Warner from 2002-05 and as a senior fellow at the National Defense University before joining Wikistrat in 2016. When Kadtke first interviewed with a couple of Wikistrat executives to discuss working for them, he said it became obvious to him that there was more to this company than meets the eye.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“It was clear to me that both of these guys had intelligence backgrounds, intelligence professionals, not academics or analysts,” Kadtke told The Daily Beast. “They were using their experts for tacit information going on in various parts of the world. I got the impression they were doing things outside of Wikistrat. It seemed mysterious.”Working for Wikistrat didn’t seem to clear up Kadtke’s questions. Kadtke said that, in retrospect, Wikistrat appeared to be more about intelligence collection than anything else.Elad Schaffer, the Wikistrat CEO who succeeded Zamel this year, did not respond to a request for comment.Asked about Kadtke’s remarks about intelligence collection, one former high-ranking employee said, “Could he [Wikistrat’s founder] have done this? Yes, by all means,” adding that Wikistrat’s work “was not limited to geopolitics.”HUSH HUSHThe documents provide rare insight into a company that Wikistrat employees repeatedly described as extraordinarily secretive. “Joel ran a very compartmentalized organization,” one former high-ranking staffer said. “I felt like I had no real visibility into what the company was really doing,” another former senior employee said.“He was very secretive, everything was highly compartmentalized… It was clear that he kept the entire company in the dark. Even [company executives] didn’t have the whole picture,” a former employee said, adding that if someone took a photo at a company gathering, Zamel would leave the room.“He never allowed anyone to get near his phone, his laptop, stuff like that.”Even in the internal company documents, which include a page about the company’s leadership, photos of each of the executives are included—except Zamel’s.“I suspected he was involved in other stuff simply because a man without secrets doesn’t need to be secretive. If he had nothing to hide, he would’ve been much more open. I thought he was involved in other operations.”THE ISRAEL CONNECTIONIf Wikistrat was engaged in intelligence collection, an obvious question arises: For whom?Much of the reporting so far has focused on Wikistrat’s relationship with the United Arab Emirates. For instance, The New York Times recently reported a secretive Trump Tower meeting three months before the 2016 presidential election, between Donald Trump Jr., Zamel, and George Nader, an emissary for the UAE. The meeting drew comparison to the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Zamel is reported to have pitched Trump Jr. on a social-media manipulation strategy to help his father win the election. After Trump was elected, Nader is said to have paid Zamel a large sum of money—as much as $2 million. In light of the scrutiny of Zamel’s ties to the UAE, it’s natural that news coverage would focus on that country. But Wikistrat may, in fact, have stronger ties to Israel. Zamel is a citizen of Israel and master’s graduate of IDC Herzliya—a small, elite college that’s often compared to U.S. Ivy League schools—where he studied government, diplomacy, and strategy, specializing in counterterrorism and homeland security.(The internal documents reviewed by The Daily Beast confirm that Zamel also owned the lion’s share—86 percent—of Wikistrat, with the next biggest shareholder possessing less than 6 percent of the company.)Though Wikistrat’s website lists its location as Washington, Kadtke said the company was run out of Israel the entire time he worked there.A former Wikistrat employee confirmed the company was run out of Tel Aviv, with the D.C. office only handling sales and business development, he said.“He knew a whole lot of people there [in Israel]. One of his connections was the former head of the [Israeli] intelligence directorate, Amos Yadlin.”In fact, each of Wikistrat’s principals listed Tel Aviv as their address in a 2015 copy of Wikistrat’s Virginia business license.Former employees say that at the core of Wikistrat’s leadership were three Israelis: Daniel Green, the CTO, Elad Schaffer, formerly the COO and now the CEO, and Zamel, the founder and, until this year, its CEO.“Those people were very close, and it wasn’t just professional,” one former employee said.That former employee added, “I had an initial conversation with Joel where I said, ‘One of the issues you’re going to run into, if you want to be focused on [U.S.] government work, you’re going to run into problems every day because of the Israeli connection.’ He said, ‘Well, why is that? They’re amazing allies?’”“There were many conversations internally [about this]... Israel is one of the top counterintelligence concerns for the U.S.”One of the internal documents reviewed by The Daily Beast lists a former “major in [an] elite Israeli intelligence-analysis unit,” Shay Hershkovitz, as its chief security officer and director of analytic community. That document also describes Schaffer as a former “counterterrorism officer for Israeli intelligence.” “Elad was involved in a very elite, select group of individuals performing a very important mission… dealing with the height of the global war on terrorism,” one former employee said. “He did some collaborative work with U.S. special-operations counterparts who were working in the Middle East to deal with threats coming from al Qaeda.”“Elad kept a very low profile.”Schaffer did not respond to a request for comment.‘FLYNN TOOK A REAL SHINING TO JOEL’Zamel apparently wanted former national security adviser Michael Flynn to be a member of the firm’s advisory board; Zamel spoke with him about it on multiple occasions around the time Flynn was forming his ill-fated Flynn Intel Group, a former high-ranking Wikistrat employee told The Daily Beast. “Flynn took a real shining to Joel,” the source said.Another former Wikistrat employee appeared to confirm Zamel’s links to Flynn, saying a mutual contact, Adam Lovinger, helped introduce Zamel to numerous Pentagon officials. Lovinger, a Pentagon strategist and former Trump NSC analyst, had been named to the National Security Council by Flynn and was reportedly associated with Flynn Intel Group.Flynn Intel Group would later be investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller in connection to a $530,000 payment it received from a company owned by a Turkish businessman close to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Lovinger told The Daily Beast that he had introduced Zamel to Pentagon officials after a Navy commander brought him to the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment.“I know both Joel and Mike Flynn, but I don’t know the extent of their relationship,” Lovinger added.Zamel had apparently been introduced to Flynn by Bijan Kian, Flynn Intel Group’s former vice chairman of its board of directors, according to one source. Kian had been a partner at Flynn Intel Group and served as point man on Flynn’s discussions with Zamel.Neither Flynn nor Kian responded to requests for comment.“Joel Zamel has never met Michael Flynn,” Zamel’s attorney, Marc Mukasey, told The Daily Beast via telephone. Asked about Zamel’s relationship with Kian, Mukasey hung up. However, shortly after this report’s publication, Mukasey confirmed via email that Zamel had indeed communicated with Flynn. In an email to The Daily Beast, Mukasey wrote: “Regarding Joel and Wikistrat, your information and your statistics and your numbers and your descriptions are flat-out wrong. You’ve been fed misinformation (likely by a disgruntled ex-employee) or you’re simply making things up. By way of example, there was one—and only one—conversation with Flynn.”BUT WHY?The appeal of working with a high-profile intelligence officer like Flynn is easy to see. What’s more opaque is why Zamel moved away from harvesting “crowdsourced” intel to making foreign deals. The allure of quick and easy money from extravagantly wealthy Middle East leadership figures, coupled with an increasingly personal relationship with them, represented a “shiny object” that lured Zamel away from Wikistrat’s original mission, a former senior Wikistrat employee said.And although Zamel was rich, he might not have been wealthy enough to float Wikistrat on his own.“It was never clear to me how much Joel was actually paying out of pocket to subsidize the company vs. what was brought in,” another former employee said. “Clients paid decently but not enough to sustain the company. So Joel was either substantially funding the company or we were getting money from somewhere else. That naturally leads you to focus on non-U.S. sources of income.” The documents appear to corroborate this, showing that Wikistrat had been losing large amounts of money. For example, an income statement summary shows Wikistrat’s income as -$603,000 in 2013, -$110,000 in 2014, and a projected -$773,000 for 2016.Kadtke said that, toward the end of 2017, Wikistrat’s ordinary operations (i.e., war games and analysis) went “way down.”“Around the beginning of 2017, the three people I knew there left very abruptly… The last study on the website was January 2017 (they used to do a lot). They seemed to have ceased operations,” Kadtke said. “It was very strange to me that they just sort of collapsed. It was probably a three-month period after which everyone I knew there left.”"},

  'body': 'Democrats flipped another seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on Tuesday night, bringing the total number of state legislative flips to 41 since Donald Trump’s inauguration. Helen Tai, the Democratic candidate running in the Bucks County Pennsylvania House District 178, defeated Republican Wendi Thomas on Tuesday night. The election was called after Republican Scott Petri resigned to work as the executive director of the Philadelphia Parking Authority. In the district, President Trump narrowly won 50-47, but underperformed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney who won 56-43 against former president Obama. In a sign of the growing importance of these local races to national Democrats, former vice president Joe Biden weighed in with his endorsement for Tai this month. Former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, whose PAC Win Back Your State is focusing on these down-ballot races, also endorsed Tai and he recently made an in-person appearance at\xa0her campaign office. That combination of endorsements may have helped in another state legislative contest earlier this year in Florida, where Democrat Margaret Good easily flipped a Florida seat. Since Trump’s inauguration, Democrats and specifically the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee have been working to capitalize on enthusiasm for various smaller contests to influence change at a local level as well as provide a metric for the upcoming midterm elections. They have been successful in a number of typically red districts like one in Wisconsin earlier this year and even surprises in Oklahoma as far back as July 2017.'},
 {'title': 'The Watergate Babies Remade Washington. Could the Trump Babies Be Coming to Do It Again?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Sworn in to replace the disgraced Richard Nixon, \xa0President Gerald Ford declared, “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.” Three months later, 76 Democrats won House seats, “some in districts that hadn’t elected a Democrat since before the Civil War,” marvels Henry Waxman, elected in 1974 as one of that year’s “Watergate babies,” and who went on to serve in the House for 40 years. \xa0Nixon’s resignation opened a rare window for bipartisan action, as chastened Republicans joined an energized Democratic majority on issues ranging from election reform to ethics to curbing the powers of the executive in law enforcement and foreign affairs—and ending the funding for the Vietnam War. Asked if he thinks the same thing could happen again, that a flurry of bottled-up legislation could pass post-Trump, maybe even a new war powers resolution that curbs executive power, Waxman replies, “Not really. Not yet.” After a decade of gridlock, it’s hard to imagine a burst of legislative action that could command bipartisan majorities. Even so, Waxman says, “It’s good to use the opportunity, especially after Trump, to reform the system that has worked against our best interests as a democracy, as has Trump as a president.” Two reform-minded groups dedicated to strengthening democracy, Protect Democracy Project, founded by former Obama administration lawyers, and Stand Up Ideas, co-founded by Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, have joined forces to develop a “Blueprint for the Day After” to lay out an ambitious set of proposals for quick legislative action at whatever point Trump leaves office. The goal is to be able to take advantage of a window for passing reforms that is likely to be shorter in today’s accelerated media environment than it was post-Nixon. A working draft obtained by the Daily Beast highlights five core categories: (1) restoring the integrity of elections, (2) shoring up limits on executive power, including restoring the Constitutional check on the President’s war powers, (3) ensuring that government works for the people, not the personal interests of the President and his allies, (4); protecting inclusive and fact-based democratic participation, and (5) rebuilding faith in the project of American government. Some provocative specifics include updating the Presidential Succession Act to provide a path forward “in the event an election is determined to have been tainted to the point of illegitimacy.” Citing Trump’s verbal assault on the courts and his controversial pardon of former Arizona Sheriff Arpaio, the draft report calls for “hardening” the line against interfering with an independent judiciary. To prevent corruption and conflicts of interest, and to avoid a repeat of the issues we have seen with Trump and his family business, the draft report calls upon Congress to pass a legal requirement for candidates to disclose their tax returns and for presidents and vice presidents to submit to federal ethics rules. Many of the suggested remedies to repair the damage done to our democracy by Trump’s autocratic whims could be legislated now if the Republican-controlled Congress had the will. “It’s not so much the institution is flawed, it’s how the people leading the institution view their mission,” says John Lawrence, whose new book is titled The Class of '74: Congress after Watergate and the Roots of Partisanship. Liberals running in 1974 understood they had to reform a top-heavy Congress controlled by conservative Southern Democrats to have any hope of passing meaningful legislation. Initiatives on civil rights, energy policy and consumer protections had all\xa0been jammed up by the autocracy of the system, says Lawrence, who worked in the U.S. House of Representatives for 38 years, including as Nancy Pelosi’s chief of staff when she was Speaker of the House. The first thing the Watergate babies did was form a New Members caucus. They met regularly and they demanded a meeting with every committee chair before giving them their vote. This was an exercise of power that rattled the old guard, and when Louisiana Democrat Edward Hebert, who chaired the House Armed Services committee, grudgingly appeared before the newcomers and told them that “Boys and girls, let me tell you how this place works,” that was the beginning of the end for him.

Remembering what it was like back then, Minnesota Rep. Rick Nolan, who was first elected in ‘74, told the Daily Beast “there was every bit as much, if not more, concern about the direction our nation is headed, and distrust of our politics. Discontent was everywhere, and it was well founded.”Nolan, who is retiring after this term, first introduced his Restore Democracy legislation in 2014. A 7-point plan, it calls for full disclosure of campaign financing, and a return to “regular order,” which lawmakers in both parties say that they want. That means legislation would go through the normal committee process, and there would be hearings and debate. “The Congress is one of the least democratic institutions in the country,” says Nolan, citing the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending package that just passed the House with no amendments and no debate. “Real democracy is a lot of hard work. You sit there and listen to the debate. You don’t have time to go across the street to one of the call centers (where members dial for dough).” With scheduled votes, “you have the rest of the day to raise money,” he says with disdain. \xa0In 2018, just like 1974, a lot of young people are running for Congress, and if they win, there’s nothing to prevent them from organizing and demanding Congress adapt to them. “It’s not the institution, it’s the attitude of the people in the institution,” says Lawrence.

 {'title': 'U.S. Allies Caught in New Russia Sanctions Fight Between Congress and Trump Team',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Trump administration and Congress are on yet another collision course over U.S. sanctions targeting Russia, but this time American allies are caught in the middle.Defense Secretary James Mattis is warning that India and other major defense partners could face tough U.S. sanctions for their impending purchases of new military equipment from sanctioned Russian companies, and has asked Congress for the authority to waive those sanctions. But top lawmakers have signalled that they aren’t willing to give the administration broad power to weaken a tough U.S. sanctions regime enacted last year and aimed at punishing Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors over Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election and its incursions into eastern Europe.Last week, Mattis asked Congress to give the administration a national-security waiver that would allow some U.S. allies to purchase military equipment from Russian companies without facing U.S. sanctions. The State Department designated those Russian entities for sanctions last year under a bipartisan law that mandates strict financial punishments against the country.Congressional leaders are discussing Mattis’ request, two sources familiar with those deliberations told The Daily Beast, but they aren’t likely to give the administration what it wants. Democrats and Republicans are united in their skepticism over the administration’s latest attempt to take back some of the authority it ceded to Congress last summer when Trump reluctantly signed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) into law. The escalating row represents a major stress test for Congress’ role as a check on the Trump administration’s Russia policies.Mattis’ appeal to Congress comes as India is preparing to buy a missile defense system, known as the S-400, from Russia. Under CAATSA, India would immediately face U.S. sanctions for the purchase. Mattis argued that this would harm U.S. interests and would be counter-productive to the goal of CAATSA—to limit foreign investments in Russian defense and intelligence firms—because sanctioning a strategic partner would push that country to buy even more Russian equipment. It could also prevent those nations from buying American equipment in the future, he warned.“We only need to look at India, Vietnam and some others to recognize that eventually we’re going to paralyze ourselves,” Mattis said last week at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, noting that India currently operates so-called “legacy” Russian systems that need to be revamped with the same type of equipment.A waiver like the one Mattis is requesting would give the administration back some of the power it previously had over sanctions-related policymaking. More specifically, it would allow the State Department and the Pentagon to waive U.S. sanctions against countries such as India, Indonesia and Vietnam which are preparing to upgrade their existing Russian-made military infrastructure.But that will be a tough sell for congressional Republicans, who argue that the sanctions regime is working as written, as well as for Democrats, who are wary to grant the Trump administration more power over Russia-related matters.Mattis’ request, which would apply to more U.S. allies than just India, would require brand new legislation from Congress because granting the administration that authority is prohibited under the current law. The administration has not yet asked the relevant congressional committees for a specific waiver for India’s purchase, either, five congressional sources with direct knowledge of the matter told The Daily Beast.A senior GOP congressional aide said the administration “will need to make a detailed, public case for relief” in order for Congress to seriously consider a waiver. A broader request would be even tougher. Many on Capitol Hill have made the case that the law is working as it was intended by preventing the administration from taking unilateral action without first consulting top lawmakers.“Congress could be convinced, but you’d have to have a very detailed and compelling case from the administration and from Secretary Mattis on why this would be needed,” the Republican aide said, noting that lawmakers would approach the matter with deep skepticism.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Democrats on Capitol Hill pointed out that the CAATSA law was crafted such that it gives the Trump administration the tools to resolve the India situation diplomatically. The law allows the waiving of sanctions if countries currently doing business with Russian entities can prove that they are winding down their financial relationships with those companies. Democrats say it’s up to the administration to pressure India’s government to not buy Russian equipment, instead of asking Congress to revise a law that the president already signed.“No one wants to sanction our closest allies. The point is that we gave the administration tools under CAATSA to use diplomatic leverage to get these countries to change their behavior,” a Senate Democratic aide said. “The administration just isn’t doing the hard work of diplomacy.”The law stipulates that in order to exercise waiver authority without congressional involvement, the administration would have to certify that Russia has ceased its cyberattacks. And because that’s far from the case, Mattis appears to be searching for a work-around—and lawmakers say they saw it coming.“CAATSA was one of the first times that Congress, with a Republican majority, decided to have mandatory sanctions not subject to waivers. Why did they agree to do that with a Republican Congress? Because they feared that the president would not, in fact, enforce sanctions,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-.N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Daily Beast.Lawmakers and the administration have been at odds over the waiver provisions in CAATSA ever since the law was first being written last spring. Negotiations on the waivers were so fraught at one point that some wondered whether the effort would even get off the ground. The Daily Beast first reported on efforts by top Trump administration officials to weaken key provisions of the legislation which were intended to give Congress the authority to review any attempts by the executive branch to alter the sanctions regime.But Mattis wants some of that authority back. At his Senate hearing last week, the defense secretary asked Congress to pass a national security waiver that would give Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the power to unilaterally nix certain sanctions.“So if [Pompeo] has the waiver authority and I can go to him and show it’s in our best interest, then we get an internal management of this process,” Mattis added. “But it keeps us from being boxed in by the Russians.”A State Department spokesperson declined to comment when asked if it had sent any waiver requests to Congress, but said the position of the department remains that “significant transactions with listed Russian entities will result in sanctions.” The spokesperson also declined to comment on India’s expected purchase of the S-400 system from Russia. The Pentagon did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The legislation passed with overwhelming majorities in both the House and Senate last summer, and Trump reluctantly signed the bill after disparaging it as congressional overreach. Since then, the administration has missed key deadlines to issue guidance for the sanctions, and more recently the State Department declined to implement those financial punishments against Russia at the January 30 deadline. It later implemented some of those measures after the U.S. and the United Kingdom deemed Russia responsible for the nerve-agent attack on a former Russian spy on British soil.The administration’s overall posture toward the CAATSA law has drawn swift condemnation from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, and more recently spurred the drafting of a House resolution aimed at admonishing the administration for not implementing the congressionally mandated sanctions."},
 {'title': 'Fake Green Party Candidate Exposed as Having Ties to Republican Congressman',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The former Green Party candidate in a congressional race has been exposed as a Republican plant with ties to the GOP congressman he supposedly sought to challengeMichael Zak petitioned to run under the Green Party ticket in New York’s 27th congressional district, a seat currently held by Rep. Chris Collins. Zak’s candidacy petition listed as the official contact person Ross Kostecky, a local Republican operative who interned on Collins’s 2009 campaign for Erie County, New York executive, The Daily Beast has found. “Of course I know Ross Kostecky. I’ve known him for years. He’s a good Republican,” said Chris Grant, Collins’s campaign director. “As to why he did this, you’d have to ask him. Our campaign has absolutely nothing to do with [Michael Zak]. We don’t know this person.”In 2016, Kostecky was an alternate delegate at the Republican National Convention, where he snapped a photo of Collins seconding the nomination of Donald Trump for president. Collins and Kostecky did not respond to requests for comment; Zak could not be reached for comment.Grant, a longtime Collins aide who served as the lawmaker’s chief of staff until late 2015, was adamant that he, Collins, nor the campaign had anything to do with Zak’s candidacy.“I can’t decide what’s more upsetting, the bias you have coming into this or the sheer lack of work you did before picking up the phone. Have you talked to Ross? Have you called him? Have you done that work? No? OK,” Grant told The Daily Beast last week. Kostecky did not respond to calls to his home or office at the Erie County Legislature, where he works as a clerk. Zak rescinded his candidacy on April 16 after news of his connection to Kostecky prompted local reporters to show up at his doorstep.The Green Party and Democrats say Kostecky’s involvement is a clear sign that Collins was behind Zak’s candidacy, which they say was nothing more than an obvious effort to siphon votes away from Collins’ Democratic opponent, Nate McMurray. “I have a hard time believing that someone in [Collins’s] campaign wasn’t aware of this,” said Erie County Green Party chairman Eric Jones. “The local Republican leadership is aware of this; it’s part of their playbook.”Jones and McMurray point to a since-removed Facebook profile they say belonged to Zak as evidence of his right-wing political beliefs. The profile contained a racist meme about Asians and a photo proclaiming March to be “Stop Blaming White People Month,” among other things.“All them women marching for equal rights and my wife stayed home to make me a sandwich,” “Mike Zak” wrote on January 21.Zak was simply a plant, Jones said, and a clever one at that: he shares a first and last name with an actual Erie County Green Party member who runs a Buffalo cooperative farm. That’s why so many Green Party members signed the petition to get the imposter Michael Zak on the ballot, Jones said.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Republicans are hoping that when people go into the voting booth on election day, they’ll see the Green Party candidate and that will take away one or two percent of the vote from Democrats,” Jones said. This isn’t the first time that Republicans have been caught “stealing” the Green Party line, Jones said. In 2015, the chairman of the Erie County Republican Committee personally delivered to county election officials a petition to get 87-year-old Lynette Batt registered as the Green Party candidate for a seat in the county legislature, according to Jones. Republicans were behind another fake Green Party candidate in 2016, when party operatives personally delivered a candidacy petition for a man named James DePasquale, who had recently registered as a Green Party member but who Jones said was a Republican plant. The Green Party took the Erie County Board of Elections to court, but a judge ruled that there wasn’t sufficient evidence to determine that DePasquale didn’t support the Green Party platform, allowing him on the ballot for a state senate seat that his non-existent campaign lost in a predictable landslide. Jones admits the lawsuit against the county elections board was a “hail mary.” Knowing Republicans did nothing illegal by having one of their own register as a Green Party member and petition to get on the ballot, Jones’ predecessor filed the lawsuit in an attempt to bring attention to the issue of “line-stealing” candidates, which he says is somewhat unique to Western New York.“Just because something’s legal doesn’t mean it’s ethical,” he said. “It’s an obvious attempt to take advantage of voters going into the voting booth.”Collins was elected in 2012 after narrowly defeating a Democrat. In his 2016 reelection he won nearly 70 percent of the vote (the same year Trump won almost 60 percent in the district). Nevertheless, he is being targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. Jones said the the Green Party stunt with Zak shows Collins thinks he’s vulnerable. \xa0“I do think it’s a winnable race for the Democrats just because how much negativity you have toward Trump these days, even among a lot of Republicans,” Jones said. “And then you have Collins, who has all these scandals involving his finances.”Those scandals include being accused last summer by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics of using his position as a lawmaker to help his pharmaceutical company. The OCE recommended that the House Ethics Committee launch their own investigation into the congressman, which has yet to formally begin. Earlier this month, The Daily Beast reported that Collins has supported legislation that would have helped his company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. Two weeks ago, Collins told a local news station last week that, while it was “interesting” to watch the Zak/Green Party drama play out, he had nothing to do with the candidate. "},

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned Monday night, following allegations that he physically abused four women.“It’s been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York,” Schneiderman said in a statement, hour after a bombshell report in The New Yorker. “In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”The four women, two of whom gave on-the-record interviews, accused Schneiderman of beating and choking them, actions the women characterized as “assault.” Schneiderman denied the allegations through a spokesperson. Shortly after the bombshell report, New York politicians called on Schneiderman to step down as attorney general.“The New Yorker has published an article on Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which reports multiple women making serious allegations of assault,” Schneiderman’s fellow Democrat, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said in a statement Monday night. “No one is above the law, including New York’s top legal officer. I will be asking an appropriate New York District Attorney(s) to commence an immediate investigation, and proceed as the facts merits. My personal opinion is that, given the damning corroboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as Attorney General, and for the good of the office, he should resign.”Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) issued a similar call shortly thereafter.“The violent actions described by multiple women in this story are abhorrent,” Gillibrand said in a statement Monday night. “Based on the extensive and serious reporting, I do not believe that Eric Schneiderman should continue to serve as Attorney General. There should be a full and immediate investigation into these credible allegations.”Carl Heastie, speaker of the New York state Assembly—whose members will effectively decide on Schneiderman’s replacement—had issued a statement that stopped just short of explicitly calling for his resignation.These are very serious allegations. I support Governor Cuomo\'s call for a thorough investigation," Heastie said in a statement. "I support Governor Cuomo\'s call for a thorough investigation.

Tom Buchanan and Dan Webb confirmed to The Daily Beast that Trump reached out to them about representing him, and that they couldn’t do it. “President Trump reached out to Dan Webb and Tom Buchanan to provide legal representation,” they said in a statement. “They were unable to take on the representation due to business conflicts. However they consider the opportunity to represent the President to be the highest honor and they sincerely regret that they cannot do so. They wish the president the best and believe he has excellent representation in Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow.” Buchanan is a partner at the firm Winston & Strawn, in its Washington office. Webb is the firm’s co-executive chairman, based in Chicago, according to the firm’s website. A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Buchanan and Webb’s decision highlights the challenges the president has faced in assembling a legal team to represent him for matters related to the Mueller probe. Over the weekend, Trump tweeted that numerous lawyers were eager to work for him. But so far, his team has been shrinking rather than expanding.John Dowd, one of the president’s personal lawyers, resigned from his post representing Trump late last week.

Currently, Jay Sekulow––the head of the conservative American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ)––represents the president for purposes of the Mueller probe.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump joined his personal attorney on Monday in asking a federal judge to order into arbitration a lawsuit filed by his alleged former mistress, a move that would put the proceedings behind closed doors rather than in front of a jury.“This motion seeks to enforce the arbitration provision in the Settlement Agreement,” submitted Brent Blakely, the lawyer representing Michael Cohen, himself representing President Trump. “The strong policy favoring arbitration set forth by Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act (‘FAA’) dictates that this motion be granted.”The new court filing also notified U.S. District Court Judge James Otero that “Defendant Donald J. Trump hereby joins in defendant Essential Consultants, LLC’s motion to compel arbitration.” Essential Consultants, LLC is the name of the Delaware-based shell corporation through which Cohen passed $130,000 in October 2016, for which adult film star Stephanie Clifford—better known as Stormy Daniels, her professional name—exchanged her silence about an alleged affair with Trump in 2006.Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, tweeted that he will “vigorously oppose” the motion, which he described as an attempt to have the proceedings “hidden from the American public.”“This is a democracy and this matter should be decided in an open court of law owned by the people,” Avenatti continued, adding the hashtag “#sunlight”.The original suit, filed in March, seeks to officially nullify a non-disclosure agreement signed by Daniels in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels claims that the agreement was not binding because Trump himself did not sign it.In a memo filed in support of the motion to compel arbitration, Cohen’s attorney argues that the contract between Daniels and Essential Consultants, LLC can be enforced regardless of whether Trump—or, as he was designated in the hush agreement, “David Dennison”—signed the agreement.“Clifford and EC signed the Settlement Agreement, and Clifford accepted $130,000 in consideration from EC, despite not receiving a signature from Mr. Trump,” Blakeley wrote. “Then, over the course of the next sixteen (16) months, Clifford did not at any time: reject the Settlement Agreement; offer to return or return the $130,000; or assert that the Settlement Agreement is unenforceable because it was not signed by Mr. Trump, or for any other reason.”'},
 {'title': 'Will This Man Save the Justice Department?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Noel Francisco, the U.S. solicitor general, loves cigars. So one day a few weeks into his time on the job—in the 80-year-old Justice Department headquarters in Washington—he stepped out onto the balcony outside his office, to smoke one. But when a Justice Department official spotted him smoking on the balcony, the official got a horrified look and frantically waved for Francisco to come back inside. Francisco figured he must have broken DOJ rules by smoking on the balcony, one of his longtime friends told The Daily Beast. But the truth was more harrowing: The balcony was structurally unsound and nobody had been allowed out on it for more than a decade. By stepping out for a smoke break, the solicitor general could have made the balcony fall off the building. Just a few weeks into his time as the country’s top appellate attorney, Noel Francisco literally almost broke the Justice Department. Well, at least a little part of it.“Francisco has had a front row seat to some of the biggest scandals of the last two decades.”Francisco now finds himself attached to a metastasizing controversy that could metaphorically break the department: If President Donald Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, Francisco—as the next-most-senior DOJ official—would take over his responsibility overseeing the special counsel probe. It wouldn’t be his first time in the middle of a politically electric legal showdown. From the Clinton impeachment to Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s showstopping trial, Francisco has had a front row seat to some of the biggest scandals of the last two decades. And he’s built a reputation for being committed to the rule of law and the constitutional order. Francisco went to the University of Chicago law school and then clerked for former Judge Michael Luttig and Justice Antonin Scalia. After finishing his clerkships, Ted Cruz and Chuck Cooper—Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ personal lawyer—recruited him to join Cooper’s firm. Cooper told The Daily Beast that the three men became fast friends, and that Cruz and Francisco helped him write testimony he delivered to the House Judiciary Committee arguing for Bill Clinton’s impeachment. “Even now, the three of us remain very good friends, Noel and Ted and I and the two of them together,” Cooper said. After Election Day in 2000, Cooper dispatched Francisco and Rachel Brand, who would also go on to a senior position in the Justice Department, to Tallahassee, Florida to work on the legal battle related to the recount. “It was 38 days of 24/7 chaos,” Cooper said. “I would dare say for him—as it was for most of us—it was the most extended period of time when you literally had no time to catch your breath, and barely enough time to catch a few hours of sleep at night. It was just a real death match, if you will.”His side came out the victors. Francisco went on to work in the White House Counsel’s office under George W. Bush before moving to the Justice Department’s prestigious and secretive Office of Legal Counsel. During that times, as Mother Jones noted, Francisco reviewed one of the 2005 controversial memos that gave the Bush administration legal cover to torture suspected terrorists. After his time in government, he took a position at Jones Day, the firm known for its work for Republican political candidates. Francisco won lawyer-celebrity status for emerging victorious from two Supreme Court fights: NLRB v. Noel Canning, where he argued that President Barack Obama overstepped his executive power by appointing people during a Congressional recess; and McDonnell v. United States, where he was part of Gov. Bob McDonnell’s appellate defense team. There’s a touch of irony to his work for McDonnell—as his lawyer, Francisco successfully eliminated one favorite tool Justice Department prosecutors had used to prosecute corrupt politicians. During his time at Jones Day, he worked with Don McGahn, who is now Trump’s White House counsel. Francisco’s time at the firm and his closeness with McGahn has led to speculation that he would be more politically pliant than Rod Rosenstein, who currently supervises Mueller. Fueling the speculation is Francisco’s part skepticism about special counsels. As Mother Jones observed, Francisco told Congress in 2007, “My own personal belief is that when you hand these issues off to the career prosecutors in the public integrity sections in the US attorneys’ offices in the Department of Justice, those attorneys are generally better able to assess whether a case should be pursued.” One of Francisco’s long-time friends, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Francisco would be nobody’s tool. But, that friend added, he wouldn’t be a Sally Yates; if Francisco were ordered to do something he thought were unlawful, he would quit, but it’s unlikely he would openly and affirmatively defy the president. “Does that mean Francisco would follow an order from the president to fire Mueller?”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Rosenstein, meanwhile, has dedicated his entire career to one thing: prosecutions. As a professional matter, Rosenstein has spent less time grappling with questions about the Constitution and presidential powers. So people close to both Francisco and Rosenstein said Francisco has likely put much more thought into the constitutional order than Rosenstein has. And it’s likely Francisco is quite familiar with an argument many conservative lawyers make: that Trump has the power to abolish the regulation governing the special counsel and to order the special counsel’s supervisor to fire him, and, therefore, that his doing so would not trigger a constitutional crisis. Does that mean Francisco would follow an order from the president to fire Mueller? Chuck Cooper wouldn’t say. “He’s a man of impeccable integrity,” Cooper said, when asked about Mueller’s potential firing. “A man of principle and impeccable integrity.”Francisco doesn’t relish the idea of being put in that position. In the meantime, he still enjoys cigar during work hours: while reading draft Supreme Court briefs, on a bench on the ground outside the Justice Department. "},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Dream Cabinet Thinks He’s Wrong About Everything',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Change is once again afoot in the Trump administration, this time on the national security and foreign policy front. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is out. National security adviser H.R. McMaster looks like he’ll be next. A trio of players being put forward to fill in gaps should be raising serious eyebrows, and not just from doves. In fact, Trump seems intent on hiring people into key national security positions with whom he is bound to clash, setting up more chaos within our government.The key players in this coming drama are current CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who Trump wants to move to the State Department; Gina Haspel, a career CIA officer and Pompeo’s deputy who Trump wants to take over the agency; and John Bolton, who many observers expect will be replacing McMaster. None of them appear to be on the same page as Trump with regard to critical topics, which means little future prospect of smooth runnings, and more instances of senior government officials trashing and proverbially stabbing each other in the face.To take the obvious first, Bolton is a hawk’s hawk. Trump is not. The president campaigned on, and has generally throughout his life held policy positions that look fairly isolationist, certainly when contrasted with those of major Bush-era foreign policy figures, including Bolton.Yes, yes, there has been button-size-comparing on Twitter, and Trump disapproves of the Iran nuclear deal. But he also disapproves of U.S. “entanglements” abroad, whether we’re talking Afghanistan (where he had to be dragged to his current position of maintaining U.S. involvement), NATO, or our alliance with Japan, which he has seemed happy to let handle its own defense in the face of a bellicose North Korea. Trump also has reconsidered his original support for the Iraq War, like many Americans who originally backed it (yes, he insists he was against it from the start, but…).Bolton clearly has not reconsidered anything. He\xa0told\xa0The Washington Examiner in 2015 that he stands by his support for invading Iraq and overthrowing Saddam Hussein, and that the United States should not have withdrawn forces under President Obama. That’s unsurprising, since in 1998, Bolton was\xa0lobbying\xa0for then-President Clinton to depose Hussein.Bolton was also a critic of the Clinton administration’s handling of North Korea, favoring a more hawkish approach there.\xa0He recently called for a pre-emptive strike on the Hermit Kingdom. Trump meanwhile seems interested in negotiating with Kim Jong Un after prior chest-thumping.Bolton may be laboring under the misapprehension that if he takes the job, he can talk Trump around to his way of thinking. But Trump is a 71-year-old man, and 71-year-old men do not change their opinions easily.Of course, Bolton’s elevation to national security adviser is not set in stone; McMaster has not yet vacated the position. By contrast, the job Pompeo is lined up for is sitting all but empty (Tillerson is on the pad until the end of the month). But it’s unclear, given fierce opposition from Sen. Rand Paul, absences from Sen. John McCain, and likely opposition from Democrats, whether he’ll ultimately fill it.If he does, though, Pompeo and Trump will probably clash, too.Pompeo\xa0disagrees\xa0with Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.He is also a vigorous supporter of NSA surveillance programs, with which Trump has a love-hate relationship, given his belief that the NSA “spied” on his presidential campaign. Pompeo sees NSA surveillance as “good and important work.” He also\xa0thinks\xa0that “Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database,” and that “legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.” Trump, in his wounded heart-of-hearts, cannot possibly fully agree with this, at least with regard to some Trump-world figures apparently surveilled over concerns about their Russia-friendliness.And speaking of Russia-friendliness, or lack thereof, Pompeo\xa0stated\xa0during his confirmation hearing for CIA director that Russia\xa0“has reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.” That doesn’t seem to be Trump’s view.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Nor is Pompeo’s perspective on WikiLeaks, which he has\xa0dubbed\xa0“a non-state hostile intelligence service.” Russia and WikiLeaks are matters of personal interest to Trump now, given the role both apparently played in the 2016 campaign and his reluctance to admit that publicly. So, these disagreements will amount to more than the usual Washington “policy differences” when push comes to shove.Finally, there is Haspel, someone who has spent her life within the Trump-feared and loathed “Deep State,” where, in his view, mistakes and misjudgments are routinely made, and intelligence routinely cooked up to lead the United States into those problematic foreign entanglements about which he has exhibited routine skepticism.Oh sure, Trump believes in torture, and that probably means that Haspel’s involvement with the enhanced interrogation program stands her in good stead with him. But it’s hard to believe a guy who inherently distrusts intelligence agencies is going to have a smooth and happy relationship with someone who has spent 30-plus years working at the CIA.Trumpites say the president is getting close to getting the Cabinet he wants. But don’t be surprised if Trump gets his way on staffing, and if we then see even more friction and infighting between Trump and those he has hired to do key foreign policy and national security jobs.When that happens, it will matter greatly, both for the United States and the world, which is desperately seeking cues as to how the United States will position itself so that everyone else can either act accordingly, or respond. Uncertainty and chaos may be fun with regard to domestic political campaigns or reality TV shows, but both things are extremely dangerous when the smart money says we’re much closer to a nuclear war than we have been for decades, when the U.S. is (or is not) facing off against Russia and China in a quest for international dominance, and when multiple important regions of the world are experiencing significant instability. With these nominations, Trump looks likely to guarantee more, not less, of both things, with potentially huge consequences to follow. "},
 {'title': 'How a Reagan Veteran Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Weed Business',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "I just learned about 4/20, on my tour of a cannabis cultivation center in a nondescript warehouse on an industrial strip next to a freeway in Washington, D.C., where I live. Licensed under the name Phyto Management, the center I visited is the eight cultivation business licensed in the District, and its co-founders, lawyer Edward Weidenfeld, who was general counsel to Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign, and Andras Kirshner, who has a degree in sustainable agriculture, point to the growing status and profitability of the cannabis industry. These are not aging flower children. Weidenfeld is a prosperous estate and asset protection lawyer, a pillar of the pre-Trump GOP elite. His wife, Sheila Weidenfeld, served as First Lady Betty Ford’s press secretary. Kirshner, a friend of Weidenfeld’s sons, brings scientific knowledge and has hired a fellow alumnus from the University of Maine with a master’s degree in plant breeding and genetics. They hope to develop strains of cannabis exclusive to Phyto. “Not everyone has such a regimen,” Weidenfeld says, as we tour various stages of the process, blue booties on our feet to avoid contamination, and with dark glasses at the ready to protect our eyes in the brightly lit rooms filled with plants at different stages of growth. “This idea it’s a weed and all you do is toss out the seed might get you something that might get you high, and might give you medical relief,” he says, but his goal is to produce a product pure enough and consistent enough in its dosage to pass muster with his neurologist. \xa0Diagnosed seven years ago with Parkinson’s, Weidenfeld wanted to try medical marijuana for symptomatic relief of the tremors associated with Parkinson’s, and for its potentially protective benefits. His neurologist was skeptical though not averse, “but \xa0only if I could be 100 percent certain of what I was purchasing. He told me my immune system was already heavily burdened, and I didn’t want any toxins or fungicides or heavy metals, and I should be wary of buying any of this on the street.” He knew little at that point about marijuana and the industry developing around its evolving legality, but says with a laugh, “I was in college in the seventies, which means at least I got a contact high.” \xa0Beyond that, it was a whole new world opening up to him. His two adult sons had introduced him to Andras and his expertise, and laws were changing around medical marijuana and recreational use. The American Bar Association issued a ruling of general advice in 2017 that lawyers representing cannabis growers and sellers of a drug that remains illegal under federal law would not lose admission to the bar. But getting involved in the industry can still cost someone their federal security clearance, which concerned Weidenfeld, who was on the board of the National Defense University. When he confided in a friend, who is a criminal defense attorney, about his increasing interest in cannabis, he was told, “Forget about it. You’re talking about a federal crime.” He remembers thinking, “don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time,” so he waited for his term on the prestigious university board to expire before fully committing to the business of growing marijuana and cultivating cannabis. \xa0\xa0Now in his seventies, Weidenfeld says, “On a personal level, on a profit level, and on a political basis, I determined this was a choice to do good. And it’s given me a feeling I haven’t had since 1964 when I went to the South and did the Selma to Montgomery march.” He had grown tired in his professional life as a corporate and estate planning lawyer, and he welcomes the radical change. “I didn’t feel the meaning that I’d felt earlier of somehow being a cog in producing good. I began to feel like I was moving piles of money in a wheelbarrow from one pile to another, and this was an opportunity to work with a young person I really respected.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Is the business profitable? Yes, Andras says, explaining that retail cannabis goes for $15 to $20 a gram, and $50 to $75 for an eighth of an ounce. The cost of cultivation is $7.50 to $10 a gram, which means there is a 100 percent markup in DC’s five licensed dispensaries. Weidenfeld rarely uses the word marijuana, “because of its negative connotation as a party drug,” he says, preferring the more scientific term cannabis. “Sometimes I slip.” Former Republican House Speaker John Boehner, once an ardent opponent of legalizing marijuana, announced earlier this month that he and former Massachusetts Governor William Weld, also a Republican, are joining the advisory board of a marijuana company, Acreage Holdings, that operates in eleven states. Boehner tweeted that his thinking on cannabis “has evolved,” and that the drug can help veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress and people fighting opioid addiction. Asked how friends and associates regard his new calling, Weidenfeld says, “The surprise is the number of old political associates who’ve asked me if I could hook them up.” Whatever stigma once existed has vanished with the prospect of a new growth industry where Republicans out of step with Trumpism can feel at home. “My view of politics has changed more than my view of cannabis,” says Weidenfeld, who believes the drug is helping him neurologically. “But I also know when you’ve got a degenerative disease, and there’s something that makes you laugh and takes your mind off the disease, that’s what is medically beneficial.” "},
 {'title': 'Don’t Reward Gina Haspel for the Torture of Muslims',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'After the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, America’s political leaders wrestled with the nation’s soul. Sadly, some of them lost their moral compasses, and set us on a dark path that we are still coming to terms with today, nearly two decades later. That day was particularly painful for us and the entire American Muslim community because not only were we grieving for the loss of life on 9/11 but we were doing so even as our community faced extreme backlash, and then profiling, surveillance, detention and deportations. \xa0Men stripped naked, diapered, and shackled to the ceiling; brutally beaten, shivering in unheated and dark concrete boxes and stuffed for hours in boxes the size of small dog crates. These are the horrifying images of the CIA’s “interrogation” program. It is often said that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it—and with President Trump’s nomination of Gina Haspel, a prominent figure in the torture program, to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, America is sending a dangerous message that our country is at risk of doing just that. Her nomination is a deeply troubling turn of events that has drawn opposition from the left and the right—from military leaders, veterans to human rights advocates and faith leaders.According to reports, Gina Haspel was a senior operative in the CIA’s so-called enhanced interrogation program, a program that used torture and abuse against Muslim men in an effort to extract intelligence from those the CIA believed wanted to do America harm. Thanks to rigorous oversight work by the Senate Intelligence Committee we know that so-called enhanced interrogation did not make us safer. In fact, it did the opposite, and in brutal fashion. Haspel reportedly was in charge at a “black site” in Thailand where one detainee had been subjected repeatedly to waterboarding, and she may have had an off-site position of responsibility over the same secret prison when another detainee was waterboarded nearly to death, stuffed into coffin-shaped (or smaller) confinement boxes for almost 300 hours, and forced to endure sleep deprivation, beatings and more.What message does it send to the American people, to our allies, and our enemies—and most importantly, to the President who has openly embraced torture—to confirm to lead the CIA someone so deeply complicit in torture?As immigrants and naturalized U.S. citizens, to our families and to millions of other families, America has meant hope. America has meant opportunity. While this administration continues to implement policies attacking our community, and other immigrant and communities of color, we hold fast to a different vision—a vision also held by the framers of individual freedoms and equal protection under the law. The American people deserve to know who their senators are considering to confirm to lead one of the most powerful and secretive agencies in the world. The only substantive information the CIA has so-far let the public see about Haspel and her more than 30 year career at the CIA, is a skeletal timeline and an eight-page memo that purports to clear her of fault in the destruction of video tapes documenting torture sessions. And according to one Senate intelligence committee member, the memo is “highly incomplete, raising far more questions about Haspel than it answers.” The Senate has a clear decision to make: Vote to confirm a nominee and promote someone who was a significant figure in one of our nation’s darkest chapters, and signal to the world that the U.S. may well re-open it. Or send the unmistakable message that this chapter is closed; that the United States has learned from its mistakes and won’t repeat them. Our faithful senators can send that message and reject torture by opposing Haspel as the next director of the CIA. '},

  'body': "James Comey’s first interview since President Trump fired him as director of the FBI has enraged his former agents, who deluged The Daily Beast with their disdain as they watched him tell his side of the story to George Stephanopoulos on Sunday night. Seven current or former FBI agents and officials spoke throughout and immediately after the broadcast. There was a lot of anger, frustration, and even more emojis—featuring the thumbs-down, frowny face, middle finger, and a whole lot of green vomit faces. One former FBI official sent a bourbon emoji as it began; another sent the beers cheers-ing emoji. The responses became increasingly angry and despondent as the hourlong interview played out.“Hoover is spinning in his grave,” said a former FBI official. “Making money from total failure.” When a promo aired between segments announcing Comey’s upcoming interview with The View, the official grew angrier.“Good lord, what a self-serving self-centered jackass,” the official said. “True to form he thinks he’s the smartest guy around.”A current FBI official said it was bizarre that Comey seemed so pleased with the whole episode. “It’s how happy he looked on TV while cashing in on the biggest mistake in history. His mistake,” they said. “Jim Comey made that mistake. We all just wonder what could have been and what we could’ve done to change it.”There was one former official who spoke out in support of Comey, saying the former director had seemed honest and heartfelt. “I thought he was highly trustworthy and very transparent, like watching someone in confession,” the former official said. “It seems like he’s still wrestling with it.”The six others who spoke to The Daily Beast did not respond positively to the interview by its end. One longtime Team Comey source—who is still an FBI agent—sent thumbs-up emojis repeatedly during the first half hour, but even this loyalist began to lose patience by the halfway mark—sending a frowny face. A few minutes later there was a nauseous emoji, and then a poop emoji after the final segment. Another former FBI official not historically known for their use of emojis, sent a bowing emjoi which—they explained in a follow up message—they believed to mean “slamming my head into something, obviously.”An additional source, who works frequently with the FBI, said they had refused to watch the extended cut of the interview altogether. “Didn’t watch it—I don’t care, he’s basically a scumbag. I don’t know how they’re letting him write a book in the middle of an investigation that he’s part of. I wonder if he had his book cleared by the intelligence community? He’s supposed to but I bet he didn’t.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The former FBI director was fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017. Comey responded by leaking his memos about conversations with Trump to The New York Times, which kick-started the special counsel investigation led by Comey’s predecessor, Robert Mueller.\xa0That investigation focuses on Russia influencing the 2016 election and any potential connections, assistance, or cooperation of those in Trump’s orbit. Comey quickly wrote a book about his experiences with Trump, which comes out this week. The interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos was the first stop of his book publicity tour. The much-anticipated book has been met with less than positive responses from those on the Hillary Clinton campaign. Comey has been named by Hillary Clinton as a major reason for her loss in 2016. Clinton insiders told The Daily Beast that Comey should “beg for forgiveness,” not use his book to try and explain away his actions. Days before the election, Comey publicly announced that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server, but he made no mention of the simultaneous inquires being made into Russian links to members of Trump’s team.This was seen by many inside the FBI as Comey inserting the agency into the campaign, which was especially unwise coming so close to the election, when the agency tries to abstain from anything that could have political consequences. Comey’s ouster by Trump came as a surprise to him—and everyone else—and resulted in what appeared to be a massive outpouring of support from within the FBI and those close to the bureau—there were even T-shirts printed bearing Comey’s face.FBI sources who did not support Comey’s decision to announce the reopening of the Clinton email investigation still stood by him at the time and were outraged at the way in which Trump fired the director. He learned of his dismissal after reading it on a television screen inside the Los Angeles FBI building where he was speaking to agents.Those same current and former FBI agents and officials—and others—did not respond well to Comey’s interview Sunday night. Support for Comey has dwindled as those who worked closely with him and initially supported him began to see his book and his public interactions—including Twitter selfies in Iowa—as self-serving and gauche, four sources said.Their anger has grown in recent months as agents have come to see Comey as the reason for the “current shitshow… that is the Trump presidency,” one former official, who voted for Trump, explained. Hence the onslaught of emojis when the interview with Comey began airing Sunday night. The final message sent by one source early Monday morning was the bright red SOS emoji."},
 {'title': 'Steve Bannon Becomes the Latest ‘No, Dr. King Is Really a Republican’ Troll Monster',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'There is not much that makes vomit rush up to the back of my throat faster than this: Steve Bannon quoting Dr. Martin Luther King. I’m nauseous just thinking about it now. On Wednesday, Bannon said in an interview on the BBC, “If you look at the polices of\xa0Donald Trump, anybody—Martin Luther King—would be proud of him, what he’s done for the black\xa0and Hispanic community\xa0for jobs.” Yes, the Prince of Darkness said the King of Peace would be proud of The Donald. We are through the looking glass, y’all. This is absurdist gaslighting meant to twist reality into making Trump palatable to black voters. He’s using the ghost of King to somehow approve of GOP policies. The right loves to use King, to say “King would agree with us.” It’s a way of advertising to blacks and absolving themselves of racism. And it’s a tactic that truly makes me sick.In no imaginable way would King be proud of Trump, a man whose campaign and presidency have been marked by rhetoric and policies that have led more than half of Americans to think he is racist. Trump has played to white entitlement and victimhood, he has comforted white supremacists, he has demeaned, disrespected, and dehumanized black and brown people, and he has ignored blacks in need. He is the opposite of everything King stood for. To me, when they use his name and ascribe an affinity for their policies to him, it feels like a political version of Weekend at Bernie’s, where the right holds up the dead, limp body of King, waving his soft arms around to make it look as if he supports their ideas. “Earlier this year in France Bannon told an audience to ‘wear’ accusations of racism ‘as a badge of honor.’”But, typical of how the right uses King, Bannon’s declaration of support from King requires a hyper-reductionist vision of him. It leaves King as nothing more than a cheerleader for jobs. Surely King would notice that the black unemployment rate is at or near the lowest rate in recorded history, just under 7 percent, but it’s more than double the white unemployment rate, just over 3 percent. This is evidence of the racism King sought to battle—it stems from inequality and exacerbates it. But hey, once someone is dead you can have them say whatever you want them to.Glenn Beck has played with King’s corpse several times. Once, in Alabama, he talked about King seeing “a vision built on God’s truth, with Unity and love as key principles, and the concept of boycott and Non violent [sic] were his tactics, driven by principles, and based on truth.” I don’t know what that means. To bring up King in that way seems to me to be all about wrapping yourself in his legacy like a warm blanket. Beck knows we all have strong, positive feelings about King, so he mentions King as a way of activating those feelings and giving listeners a release of dopamine. But he’s not actually saying anything. Look, I’m not saying only liberals get to quote King, but if your politics totally misalign with his, if you’re not about expanding rights for black and brown people, or economic justice for poor people, or a fundamental transformation of this country that helps create equality, then why are you mentioning King? He’s not just another great orator—he’s a symbol of moral power, a revolutionary freedom fighter, and a man who’s birthday we celebrate as a holiday. He’s a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Mentioning him as a supporter of your ideas means borrowing some of his moral authority. Beck says, “Blacks don’t own Martin Luther King.” It’s an awkward phrasing—he means blacks alone don’t get to define and talk about King; which is true, but I feel like Beck wants the right to define King however he likes. If your politics stand in opposition to King’s, then telling us that he’s your tacit endorser is frankly offensive. I cringe hardest when I hear the right use King as a symbol of color-blindness. They think that King’s comment about wanting to be judged by “the content of your character and not the color of your skin” is somehow a validation of the right’s colorblind approach to race. They use King, sometimes, to say we shouldn’t notice race because that’s not what King wanted. This is not at all what King wanted: He emphatically wanted equality and justice. But some on the right will weaponize King and use him to shame the left for noticing race—and thus not being colorblind. King is not an empty vessel into which you can pour any notion you want. He was an extraordinary writer and speaker who made his opinions clear. We know who he was. Just because he means something to us all doesn’t mean you can make him mean anything you want. King is sacred not just to black people but to America as a whole and misappropriating his legacy is low. Especially when done by someone like Bannon. Earlier this year in France he told an audience to “wear” accusations of racism “as a badge of honor.” To Bannon, people should be proud to be racist. He’s telling them this because racism is a tool he knows how to use. And within the machinery of how Bannon markets political drama meant to stoke white fear, King is nothing but a prop. '},
 {'title': 'Democrats Are Raising Gobs of Cash. It May Not Be Enough.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A paradigm shift in political fundraising is playing out across the 2018 midterms landscape.In a large number of congressional races throughout the country, Democratic candidates are raising gobs of cash for their own campaigns—in the process, shedding the necessity of national party groups for financial aid. The success of this strategy has been fueled by unparalleled enthusiasm on the left, wins in smaller legislative contests, and the increased prevalence of online fundraising platforms like ActBlue. In February 2018 alone, that fundraising service helped campaigns and candidates raise $59,511,643, with an average contribution size of $37.06. That figure was $1 million more than ActBlue accumulated in February of 2016, a presidential election year. “Smaller donors can equal motivated volunteers,” J. Tucker Martin, a Virginia-based Republican consultant told The Daily Beast. “And that matters a lot. The early Democratic fundraising advantage is really just another log on the pile of evidence that there is a wave building on their side. Which is undeniable right now.”The flow of fundraising money directly to the candidates could have a profound impact on everything from how the respective parties prioritize their resources, to midterm messaging, to what seats end up most competitive in November. It’s not without risk for the broader Democratic Party. But there is already some evidence that the new paradigm will pay off. During the first financial quarter of 2018, there were at least 58 GOP-held seats in which a Democratic challenger raised more than the Republican incumbent, according to an analysis from the Cook Political Report. The reverse scenario happened in only six Democratic-held seats. Additionally, at least a dozen Republican members also trail in terms of the cash they have on hand. Democrats would need to win a net 24 seats to flip the majority in the House of Representatives, less than half of those in which they have raised more money. All of which is not to say that Republicans are in dire financial straits. Far from it. So far, GOP groups have more than enough money to bolster any anemic fundraising candidates. The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee had raised more than $105 million by the end of February this year and the Republican National Committee raised more than $157 million. Meanwhile the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised more than $125 million and the Democratic National Committee, which has struggled to raise money of late, had more than $81 million. Conservative super PACs, likewise, have largely outpaced their liberal counterparts in terms of both fundraising and spending on races up to this point. The DCCC emphasized the action they\'re taking to boost candidate money as a long-term goal. “Candidates are our best asset and we’ve been very intentional in building a support system to elevate and empower grassroots Democrats," DCCC national press secretary Tyler Law said. "From a tactical standpoint, campaign dollars certainly go a lot farther than outside groups. But most importantly, we want candidates telling their own stories and bringing their message directly to voters, not relying on outside groups to prop them up.”But nationally generated funding pools aren’t always as effective as locally generated ones. Television stations charge much higher ad rates to super PACs and political committees than they do to actual campaigns—meaning that a candidate’s dollar can go further. And while a party apparatus can help save a candidate under siege, it can also destroy his or her chances by pulling out its resources. “Obviously national committees have to make decisions for the good of the order,” said Martin. “They’re going to be focused on preserving majorities; not looking out for personalities. For them it’s a math equation. And less money to spend on more races leads to tough, pragmatic, decisions having to be made.”So far, GOP committees and PACs have shown a willingness to spend on virtually everyone (save some hesitation toward an alleged pedophile running for Senate in Alabama). In a recent special election in Pennsylvania, Republican candidate Rick Saccone did not come close to matching the fundraising numbers his opponent, Conor Lamb. But the Congressional Leadership Fund, a PAC closely aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), and NRCC spent millions on his behalf, despite it being a district President Trump won by nearly 20 points. Lamb ended up winning by a small margin. In an upcoming special election for a safe Arizona seat, the RNC has invested at least $281,250 as Democratic candidate Hiral Tipirneni has out-raised her Republican opponent Debbie Lesko.

They also made a $48 million investment in television and digital ads for the fall this week, after Ryan announced his retirement. “I don’t think one party is going to have a significant edge over each other,” a Republican House campaign operative, requesting to speak on background, told The Daily Beast. “We’ll have the money to compete where we want to compete.”But others in the party are fearful that if they are forced to play defense in dozens of districts where their candidates are being out-raised, they could ultimately run up against an issue of finite resources. Raising money, after all, is a resource intensive process itself. And if a Democratic candidate can do it largely online, a Republican candidate or committee would be disadvantaged in having to host fundraisers, place calls, or beg for bucks through other mechanisms. “It’s hard to put out fires everywhere if in fact there are something like 75 Republican seats in play,” Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics told The Daily Beast, referring to Republican efforts to play defense. “Incumbents in safe seats aren’t doing the national party any favor by slacking off on their fundraising.”Not all elements of the new fundraising paradigm are great for Democrats, however. Though individual candidates are pulling in massive amounts of cash, the inability of the party committees to match their Republican counterparts means that more campaigns will be on their own for survival. That may be fine for those candidates running in swing districts, many of whom have recoiled at being associated with the national party. But air cover in a tight race is still vital. And the diminished presence of the national committees also means that there is less message-cohesion from the party across the congressional races. Republicans, meanwhile, believe that crowded primaries on the Democratic side will force candidates to not just move farther to the left in order to appeal to primary voters but also spend their resources early. “House Democratic candidates in competitive districts all throughout the country are going to be forced to spend an enormous amount of money informing voters of how progressive they are just to be able to capture the Democratic nomination,” Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the NRCC said in a statement. “The positions they’ll take and resources they’ll expend will render them unelectable when it comes time for the general election.”Perhaps the best evidence GOP leadership has when downplaying the early fundraising advantages for Democratic candidates, is that money doesn’t always correlate with electoral success. That was certainly true to anyone who observed Democrat Jon Ossoff’s failed 2017 bid in Georgia’s special House election, when he spent tens of millions only to lose by less than three points. But even that was a bit of a pyrrhic victory for Republicans, as the district was rated R+8 and has sent a Republican to Congress since 1979. And as the party charts out an already difficult midterm climate, they will soon be forced to make a whole new set of calculations, based on a diffuse but successful Democratic fundraising operation. “Democrats are out-raising a number of Republican incumbents for reasons connected to Democratic successes at the ballot box already this cycle—chiefly, that Democratic voters and grassroots donors are just more engaged this cycle than Republicans,” Carolyn Fiddler, political editor at the liberal outfit Daily Kos told The Daily Beast.

 {'title': 'Trump Channels Inner Dictator, Calls for Samantha Bee to Be Fired',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Early Friday morning, Donald Trump once again showed us that he’s a Third World dictator in the making as he sought to silence another critic. In this case, it’s comedian Samantha Bee. Trump declared Friday by a royal edict (still presently referred to as a tweet):  “Why aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard.”  He then added, “but that’s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!”If you think this demand by Trump to fire Bee is simply about Bee using the c-word on her comedy show Wednesday to slam Ivanka’s complicity in Trump’s despicable policy of separating children from parents if they cross the border illegally, you have not been paying attention. Trump has been waging a war on freedom of expression since his campaign which continues through today. His goal is to silence or at least delegitimize those who criticize him—from the news media to comedians like Bee and “Saturday Night Live.”  It’s as if Trump is following page by page the “Dictator for Dummies” playbook.Until now, much of the criticism of Trump regarding the Roseanne Barr-Samantha Bee controversy has rightly been about the White House’s swift denunciation of Bee but Trump’s refusal to denounce Barr’s racist tweet that compared former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to an ape. Trump, who had praised Roseanne in March after her show’s premier by personally calling her and then touting her in a rally where he told the crowd the show was “about us,” has still not condemned his long time friend’s racism. But that’s Trump. This is the same guy who refused to denounce David Duke during the campaign when first asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper. And then after Charlottesville, Trump equated the white supremacists with those protesting hate by saying there were “fine people” on both sides. And this is the same Trump, who to the delight of the primarily white crowds at his rallies, will demean visible black people from Jay-Z (as we saw again this week) to Rep. Maxine Waters to NFL players who took a knee to protest institutional racism.“Trump’s attacks on freedom of expression go far beyond just news media. Trump also wants to silence those in the entertainment world who are vocal critics.”Trump is a man who trafficked in bigotry and racism to win the White House. It’s vile but it plays well with much of today’s GOP base. However, you would think Trump’s attacks on freedom of expression would trouble the right, which has long touted “freedoms.” But what Trump has done is effectively and dangerously transformed freedom of the press and freedom of speech into a partisan issue. He has made it okay for his base to cheer the silencing of his critics by literally framing them as the “enemy of the American people.” That’s why a 2017 poll found that nearly 50 percent of Republicans support closing down media outlets that are “biased or inaccurate.”  (Obviously Trump and his supporters view “inaccurate” as critical of Trump.)That’s why the right is disturbingly silent despite Trump, like other authoritarian leaders, waging a war to destroy his critics in the media. For example, in October Trump called for challenging NBC’s broadcast license for what he deemed its “fake news.” He declared last year that it was “disgusting” the way “the press is able to write whatever they want to write.” (Yeah, that’s called freedom of the press.) And recently we learned Trump personally sought to use the apparatus of the federal government to punish The Washington Post for its criticism of him by  seeking to raise postage rates on Amazon, whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Post.  (Trump has tweeted in the past the hashtag #AmazonWashingtonPost so he clearly sees them as the same entity.)But Trump’s attacks on freedom of expression go far beyond just news media. Trump also wants to silence those in the entertainment world who are vocal critics. During the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump demanded Saturday Night Live be cancelled for its “hit job on me,” as Trump put it on Twitter.  And even after Trump won, he still slammed SNL as being “terrible,” clearly with the hopes of hurting the show’s ratings. In April, Trump called for an end to the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner because he objected to the way comedian Michelle Wolf had mocked his administration at the event. In response to Wolf’s comedy that focused on the Trump administration’s lies, Trump tweeted: “The filthy ‘comedian’ totally bombed. Put Dinner to rest or start over!”And now we have Trump calling on Bee to be fired. You know who else hates comedy at their expense? Authoritarian leaders. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a man Trump loves, banned Egypt’s version of The Daily Show because of the way its comedy mocked the government. The show’s star, Bassem Youssef, had to flee the country and is now living in exile with his family.Turkey’s strongman leader\xa0Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded the prosecution of a German comedian for simply reading a poem mocking Erdogan. While the case did go to court, it was ultimately dropped. But Erdogan’s intended goal of silencing comedians who dare mock the Turkish leader was heard. So for those who think Trump calling for the firing of Bee is simply about a profane (and obviously indefensible) joke focusing on his daughter, think again. This is all part of Trump’s efforts to follow in the footsteps of people like Vladimir Putin, Sisi, and Erdogan to stifle free speech and criticism. And if we don’t speak out vocally–including Republicans–Trump may actually succeed in turning the United States of America into Trumpistan. '},

  'body': 'Iowa State Sen. Nate Boulton, one of six candidates in the state’s Democratic gubernatorial primary, announced Thursday that he will suspend his campaign following accusations of sexual misconduct.On Wednesday, The Des Moines Register reported that three women accused Boulton of sexual misconduct, including an allegation that he repeatedly grabbed one woman’s behind at a bar in 2015. Two other women told the paper that Boulton rubbed his crotch against them over a decade ago in law school, “pressing his erect penis into their thighs.”“These the last 48 hours have been trying,” Boulton said in a statement. “I again offer an apology to those whom I have harmed in any way. It is my hope there is some positive that can come from this moment as we strive to be the better people we can be in the coming days, weeks, months, and years. I know that will be my task moving on from here.”Boulton didn’t deny the allegations to the Register but said: “I don’t have the same recollection. But I am not going to offer any additional context to this, other than to say if someone’s perspective is that it was inappropriate and I crossed a line and I misread a situation in a social setting, I do apologize.”Two weeks ahead of Iowa’s primary, a recent poll indicated that Boulton was in second place, running behind retired businessman Fred Hubbell. The winner will face incumbent Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds.  '},
 {'title': 'The New Law That Killed Craigslist’s Personals Could End the Web As We’ve Known It',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'For countless folks who came of age in the 00s, finding a partner via the Craigslist personals section was a rite of passage. I remember pouring over the ads with friends, amazed at the sheer variety of sexual and romantic asks and desires out there, the strange and tantalizing mix of anonymity and eros and possibility. I brokered my best ongoing "casual encounter" through the Craigslist personals. I know others who met long-term partners and even spouses that way. But as of Friday, the Craigslist personals section is no more. Consider it one of the first—but certainly not the last—casualties of new legislation passed by the Senate this week 97-2. The bill, euphemistically known as the "Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act," or FOSTA, was passed by the House of Representatives in late February. It\'s been largely portrayed by the media and those in Congress as an "anti-sex trafficking" measure. But while doing nothing to realistically fight sex trafficking, it manages to muck up all sorts of other serious things. FOSTA will "subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully," Craigslist explains in the brief notice that now appears in place of potential partners if you try to go to a personals listing . Under current law, the site can\'t be held legally liable if someone uses veiled terms to solicit commercial sex—aka prostitution—through the Craigslist personals. But FOSTA will change that, opening up Craigslist (and every other digital platform) to serious legal and financial jeopardy should it accidently "promote" or "facilitate" prostitution. Prostitution, mind you, is not sex trafficking, which has a distinct meaning both colloquially and under the law. In the simplest terms, prostitution involves consent and sex trafficking does not. "Any tool or service can be misused," Craigslist said a statement. "We can\'t take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services, so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline. Hopefully we can bring them back some day. To the millions of spouses, partners, and couples who met through craigslist, we wish you every happiness!"Craigslist isn\'t the only one making changes since FOSTA\'s passage. On Friday, the adult-ad forum CityVibes disappeared. And on Thursday, Reddit banned several sex-related subreddits, including r/Escorts, r/MaleEscorts, and r/SugarDaddy. Reddit said the purge was enforcing its new content policy, which bans "transactions for certain goods and services," including "paid services involving physical sexual contact." But frequenters of these subreddits say they were forums for sex-work news, tips, questions, and camaraderie, not places where sex workers advertised their services. This failure to distinguish between ads for prostitution and any discussion of prostitution is part of what has sex workers (and free-speech advocates) so worried. Sex worker blogs could be shut down, and they could find their social-media accounts suspended simply for being honest about their work. This is because the core of FOSTA makes it a federal crime to "promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person," punishable by up to 10 years in prison, plus fines. For promoting the prostitution of five or more people, the penalty is 25 years, and the same if promoting someone\'s prostitution "contributed to sex trafficking." Sex workers don\'t have to worry about being punished for posting their own ads, but they could run afoul of the law if working in pairs or helping a colleague place an ad.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The primary target are websites, apps, messageboards, and other digital publishers, which have deeper pockets. To reach them, Congress had to carve a hole in Section 230, which has governed the internet for 22 years. It protects web platforms from being sued in civil court or criminally charged by state prosecutors for third-party (i.e., user-posted) content. (It doesn\'t apply for federal crimes.) Section 230 says that unless they create the content in whole or part, these platforms shall not be treated as the speaker of such content, and good-faith efforts at content moderation (like banning ads that explicitly mention illegal acts or auto-filtering out content that contains prohibited words) do not change this. Under FOSTA, this won\'t apply when paid sex is concerned. That\'s why sites are scrambling right now to prohibit any content that could get them held liable. It\'s probably too late, or at least would be if legislators get their way. FOSTA "shall apply regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred… before, on, or after such date of enactment." This is what\'s known as an ex post facto law, and it\'s explicitly forbidden by the U.S. Constitution. No less than the U.S. Department of Justice has urged against passing FOSTA, calling it unconstitutional and saying that it would make prosecuting sex traffickers harder. "You\'re heading in the wrong direction if you [pass a bill] that would raise the burden of proof in cases against sex traffickers," said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden Wednesday from the Senate floor. Wyden—who co-authored Section 230—was the only Democrat to vote against the bill, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul the only Republican. An amendment to FOSTA proposed by Wyden would have clarified that websites can try to filter out illegal content without increasing their liability, but it was overwhelmingly defeated. Wyden stressed that FOSTA is not a matter of substituting some free-speech rights for a better ability to stop sex trafficking. Rather, it\'s imposing serious burdens while at best doing nothing for trafficking victims and quite likely making their lives worse. For one thing, it incentivizes law enforcement to go after third parties rather than stop traffickers or rescue victims. It also takes away an important tool for finding trafficking victims—the open internet. This new paradigm creates huge incentives for cops and prosecutors to go \xa0after websites and apps rather than actual criminals—ensuring thatreal victims, and public safety, will suffer along with open expression. Online ads have allowed an untold number of victims to be identified and found. What\'s more, the digital trail of ads, emails, and texts can provide evidence that makes catching and prosecuting the perpetrators easier. Law enforcement loses this when traffickers switch to private, encrypted, or dark web forums. Many sex-trafficking survivors and victims groups vocally opposed FOSTA, saying it fails to address the things they really need (like housing and job assistance) and will make saving future victims harder. Plus, even those being forced or coerced into prostitution benefit from things like screening out violent clients and not having to walk the streets. The bottom line is that FOSTA "is not going to prevent sex trafficking [and] it\'s not going to stop young people from becoming victims," Wyden said. What it will do is create "an enormous chilling effect on speech in America," as sites move to squelch anything remotely related to a liability and "powerful political" forces weaponize it against minority voices. We\'re already starting to see the chill, even though FOSTA hasn’t even been signed into law yet. And it goes beyond speech related to sex. For instance, Reddit\'s sex-work subreddit bans were accompanied by bans of forums for gun talk and trading gaming logins, among others. While Reddit would still have Section 230 protection should any illegal conduct arise from these forums, it\'s hard to say how long that will last now that\'s Congress has decided to start making exceptions. After all, how can we say that Craigslist should be prosecuted if its ads broker prostitution but not a gun sale that leads to the next school shooting? How can we say that social media is criminally liable if a "john" meets a 17-year-old girl there, but not if two terrorists hook up and hatch out plans through their DMs? \xa0Or what about the next time hackers post illegally obtained state secrets (or nudes) on some remote corner of some social forum? Sex trafficking is horrific. But so are a lot of other crimes. And under FOSTA, our law effectively says that both sex trafficking and paid sex between two consenting adults are more grave offenses that rape, child molestation, mass murder, or anything else. What kind of logic is that? The answer to this conundrum is that the creators of Section 230 were onto something. Because once we decide something like prostitution is so bad that it overrides it, what won\'t warrant an exception? And once we start treating technology as the guilty party in any badness it brokers, we will wind up with tech overlords terrified to let us speak about anything controversial at all. \xa0'},
 {'title': 'The Myth of Trump’s Unparalleled GOP Support',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Among the chattering classes, conventional wisdom suggests that President Donald Trump’s standing remains incredibly strong among Republicans. This notion is used to dismiss the possibility that someone (say, a newly disgruntled U.S. ambassador to the United Nations) could muster a serious primary challenge to the president in 2020. It’s also used to absolve congressional Republican enablers of their obsequiousness. \xa0Take, for example, Sen. Bob Corker’s (R-TN) recent comments about Republicans’ reluctance to push back on Trump’s attacks on Robert Mueller. “The president is, as you know—you’ve seen his numbers among the Republican base—it’s very strong. It’s more than strong, it’s tribal in nature,” Corker said. “People who tell me, who are out on trail, say, look, people don’t ask about issues anymore. They don’t care about issues. They want to know if you’re with Trump or not.”Corker seems to be right about how GOP lawmakers generally perceive the president’s strength within the party. But do the numbers actually affirm this perception?According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating among Republicans is currently at 85 percent. This is certainly respectable, but hardly unique. In April 2002, George W. Bush boasted a 98 percent approval rating among Republicans, according to Gallup. This was seven months after the 9/11 attacks but his approval rating among Republicans had been at 87 percent the day of the attacks. As someone who lived through the Bush era, I can attest that Bush was able to impose pretty strict party loyalty on the right. But by April 2006, his approval rating among Republicans was hovering around 80 percent—not too far from where Trump is now. Those midterm elections were a disaster for the GOP. And it went downhill fast from there. We tend to remember things like Hurricane Katrina and Abu Ghraib—huge scandals that deservedly hurt Bush with the American public. But, on the right, it was the Harriet Miers debacle that created a permission structure for conservatives to finally begin criticizing a Wilsonian foreign policy, the controversy over the transfer of U.S. ports to a Dubai firm, and, ultimately, to derail Bush’s 2007 attempt at a comprehensive immigration reform proposal that included a pathway to citizenship; or amnesty, for its critics. The point here is that the danger to Trump isn’t merely that he could be “primaried.” A more likely scenario is that Republican politicians will eventually discover that they can stand up to a Republican president without fear of reprisal. Since fealty to Trump has always been premised on a transactional calculation (as opposed to personal affection, shared goals, or mutual respect), the only thing binding them to Trump is the perception that their political base demands it. When that changes—and history suggests that this happens to even the most popular presidents—the levee breaks. Sometimes all it takes is one big mistake.In March 1991, just after the Gulf War ended, President George H.W. Bush’s approval rating with the nation, not just Republicans, stood at 89 percent. Bush boasted a 95 percent approval rating among Republicans his second year in office. (This chart shows second year approval ratings by party going all the way back to Eisenhower.)And yet, not only did Bush go on to lose the presidency to Bill Clinton in 1992, but he had to fend off tough challenges from populists Pat Buchanan (in the GOP primary) and Ross Perot (who ran a third-party presidential campaign) in the general election. How did this happen? There is some question as to how important Bush’s breaking of his “Read My Lips, No New Taxes!” pledge hurt him among voters who actually showed up at the polls, but anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist said the reversal “’depressed the hell out of the [Republican] base’ because it was a fundamental breach of faith.’” Clinton certainly contributed to Bush’s woes by running ads ripping the broken promise.I don’t think that Donald Trump will make this kind of mistake. He is less noble than George H.W., who believed he was doing the right thing for the nation even if it cost him politically. Trump also has a better political instincts when it comes to knowing what a Republican base will tolerate. Still, the defeat of “41” should serve as a cautionary tale for any politician who wants to take solace in their approval ratings.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.History suggests it is incredibly difficult to wrest the nomination from a sitting president. Trump is significantly more popular within his party than either Jimmy Carter or Gerald Ford—two presidents who were able to survive primary challenges only to go on to lose the general. The question is not whether Trump could survive a primary if he had to, but how costly it would be. What is more, it is worth examining whether Trump’s popularity with the GOP base justifies the amount of deference some Republican politicians and elites are paying him. The truth is that there isn’t a huge correlation between the sophomore numbers and political resilience. Both Bushes had sky-high approval numbers their second year in office, and one lost re-election after fending off a primary challenge, while the other narrowly survived re-election, despite avoiding a primary challenge. Meanwhile, Reagan (79 percent) and Nixon (82 percent) both had pretty average numbers their second year among Republicans, and both went on to win huge landslides. Trump’s popularity with Republicans is really just pretty average. There is little doubt that the intensity among his strongest supporters is high, but this asterisk is overwhelmed by another important caveat. As Gallup notes: “Fewer Americans identify as Republicans or say they are Republican-leaning independents than did so in November 2016, the month Donald Trump was elected president.” It may be that Trump is popular among people who identify as Republicans, simply because the Republicans who don’t like him are… no longer Republicans. In others words: Trump’s approval rating in his party climbs because his party is shrinking. Maybe Bob Corker shouldn’t be quite so afraid."},
 {'title': 'Stormy Daniels’ Lawyer: We’re Going to Sue Trump for Defamation',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Stormy Daniels plans to sue Donald Trump for defamation after the president called a forensic sketch of a man who allegedly threatened her a “total con job.”Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, vowed to file the defamation claim “in short order” following a hearing in Los Angeles federal court on Friday.The proceeding related to Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s motion to delay Daniels’ primary lawsuit, which seeks to invalidate a “hush agreement” she signed weeks before Election Day over her alleged romp with the president.Cohen sought a 90-day stay in the civil case, citing his battle with federal prosecutors in Manhattan over a pending criminal probe.U.S. District Court judge James Otero didn’t make a ruling Friday. Instead, he told Cohen to file a declaration indicating his Fifth Amendment rights would be endangered if Daniels’ suit moves forward, the Associated Press reported. Otero said Cohen would need to file his own statement by Wednesday. In his initial motion, the embattled Trump stalwart included a declaration from his own attorney, but Otero ruled the statement was not enough. Outside the courthouse, Avenatti told the press he was pleased with the hearing. “To quote the court… there are gaping holes in the application by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump to delay this matter,” he said.Avenatti also said that he would soon file a separate lawsuit against Trump, or amend Daniels’ current complaint to include a defamation claim against him.“I very much look forward to placing Mr. Trump under oath...”“I fully anticipate that we will be amending this complaint in short order, or filing a separate action against Mr. Trump for his defamatory, outrageous statements made earlier this week where he effectively called my client a liar and stated that she was trying to pull a con on the American people,” Avenatti said.“I very much look forward to placing Mr. Trump under oath and asking him about the basis for those outlandish, outrageous, baseless statements,” he added.In early March, Daniels filed a lawsuit to void a “hush agreement” she signed over her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. She claims the nondisclosure agreement—inked weeks before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for a $130,000 payout from Cohen—was invalid because Trump never signed it. Daniels amended her complaint on March 26 to include a defamation claim against the president’s ultra-loyal attorney.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Judge Otero’s words capped off a dramatic week in the Cohen-Daniels circus that began with a hearing over Cohen’s FBI raid. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for New York’s Southern District is reportedly investigating Cohen for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign-finance violations. And the feds are seeking records about Cohen’s role in silencing Daniels and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal in the run-up to the presidential election.On Monday, Cohen was in Manhattan federal court requesting a temporary restraining order to stop prosecutors from reviewing seized materials, which he said were protected by attorney-client privilege and should first be sorted by an independent “special master” rather than federal investigators.Daniels was in the courtroom as U.S. District Court judge Kimba Wood denied Cohen’s request. (Wood, who said she’d consider a special master, ordered the feds to provide an estimate of the volume of records seized.) Cohen was also ordered to cough up a list of his clients. Before the proceeding, he’d named two and kept a third secret. But Wood demanded Cohen’s team name the mystery man, who ended up being Fox News host Sean Hannity.On Tuesday, Daniels and Avenatti appeared on ABC’s The View to unveil a forensic sketch of a goon who allegedly threatened her to stay quiet about her affair with Trump. The encounter allegedly occurred in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011. The day after her interview, Trump took to Twitter to call Daniels’ bully “a nonexistent man” and the sketch itself “a total con job.”In her first live TV interview, Daniels said she’s speaking out against Trump and his loyal attorney because: “I’m done being bullied.” When the conversation returned to Monday’s court hearing, Avenatti said, “There’s no question in my mind that Michael Cohen, a) is going to be indicted within the next three months, and b) he’s going to roll on the president.”On Wednesday, Politico and The Wall Street Journal reported that some of Trump’s closest allies have warned him Cohen could “flip” and cooperate with the feds. “That’s what they’ll threaten him with: life imprisonment,” Trump-backing lawyer Alan Dershowitz told Politico. “They’re going to threaten him with a long prison term and try to turn him into a canary that sings.”Jay Goldberg, who last represented Trump in the early 2000s, told the Journal that the president phoned him seeking advice last week. On a scale of 1 to 100—with 100 being fully protecting the president—Cohen “isn’t even a 1,” Goldberg told Trump.Meanwhile, Avenatti tweeted Thursday that he and Daniels would “vehemently argue” against Cohen’s move to delay her lawsuit. “The American people deserve the truth as quickly as possible,” he wrote.Cohen’s request for a 90-day delay of Daniels’ case was filed last week on Friday. Attorneys for Cohen and Trump said they requested the stay of proceedings due to the FBI raid on Cohen’s home, office and hotel room. The searches were related, in part, to Daniels’ lawsuit against Cohen.“Because the facts underlying this action and the criminal investigation related to Mr. Cohen overlap, Mr. Cohen’s Fifth Amendment rights may be adversely impacted if this case proceeds,” the motion states. The document was signed by Cohen’s lawyer, Brent Blakely, and Trump’s counsel, Gawker-slayer Charles Harder.Avenatti, in court papers opposing the request, said Cohen and Trump didn’t provide any evidence justifying the stay of the porn star’s case. Indeed, Trump made no claim in court filings about his own Fifth-Amendment rights at all.“Even though Mr. Cohen expresses concern about making self-incriminating statements… the record demonstrates that Mr. Cohen has already freely and openly discussed this matter in the public, including under oath in declarations filed in this case,” Avenatti wrote.The defendants—who haven’t been indicted—didn’t present evidence “to demonstrate the materials the FBI seized have any relationship to this case,” Avenatti added.

 {'title': 'Michael Flynn Is Back on the Campaign Trail in Montana to Unseat Jon Tester',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Donald Trump and Michael Flynn are collaborating again. No, the president and his former national security adviser aren’t formally working hand-in-hand. Nor are they on the same team. But as Trump continues to wage an all-out war on Montana’s Democratic Senator Jon Tester for the Senator’s role in derailing White House physician Ronny Jackson’s bid to serve as the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Flynn is set to go after the Montana Democrat from a different vantage point. The retired Lieutenant General, who pled guilty to lying to the FBI while serving the Trump administration, will be hitting the campaign trail this coming week. And he will be doing so for Troy Downing, a Republican businessman and Air Force veteran competing to win the Republican nomination, next Sunday in Billings. This is the second time that Flynn has appeared at a campaign event for a Republican candidate this year. Previously, he spoke at an event for GOP candidate Omar Navarro, who is mounting a longshot bid to defeat Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). While Flynn is not exactly an in-demand hype man for Republican candidates across the country, his status as the most prominent victim of Robert Mueller’s probe has given him a certain cachet within Trump-loving circles. “I think it’s great Gen Flynn is hitting the campaign trail,” former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo told The Daily Beast. “Deployed judiciously in districts where we need the base activated, the General could serve the President valiantly once again. And the way the Russia investigations are fizzling, he could be the Republicans’ secret weapon in the fall.”Downing said that he was excited to have a fellow former service member drum up support for him in his bid to unseat Tester. “General Flynn is a patriot who has put 30 years of service into this nation,” Downing told The Daily Beast in an interview. “That resonated with me. One of the issues that General Flynn and I share is we have too many career politicians mucking things up in D.C. I think he’s excited about sending another combat veteran to D.C and start cleaning up that mess.”Downing was unconcerned about Flynn’s guilty plea to the charge that he misled FBI agents about conversations he’d had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, as well as and Flynn’s agreement to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign and potential collusion with Russian government officials. “He was doing what he believed was in the best interest to this nation,” Downing said. “I think he got caught up in a mess.”Describing the probe in general, the candidate said “Obviously it’s gone on too long. I think it’s time to move on. I believe that it has been for a large part a witch hunt.”In entering the Montana GOP primary, Flynn is crossing paths—albeit at a distance—with the president he briefly served. Trump’s \xa0increasing acrimony towards Tester, one of ten Senate Democrats up for reelection in a state Trump won in 2016, has put heightened focus on the election and raised conservative hopes of flipping the seat.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Downing recently shared a message he received from Flynn on his Twitter page that largely mirrored Trump’s recent statements. \xa0"Tester’s actions to denigrate ADM Ronny Jackson are what is wrong with WASHINGTON DC. I was glad to see the #POTUS go after him this morning,” Flynn’s message read. “My son and I are very much looking forward to coming up to help you win."Flynn Jr. has also tweeted about his excitement to join Downing on the trail. But despite the high-profile endorsement, Downing’s path to the nomination might not be so simple. Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale has been viewed as a favorite to compete against Tester in November. At a recent candidate forum, there was little daylight between their ardent support for the administration. Yet former Billings judge Russ Fagg did express concern about certain national endorsements in the race, specifically former White House adviser Steve Bannon’s backing of Rosendale. “Steve Bannon is all in for Matt, and that even troubles me more than Michael Flynn,” Fagg reportedly said. Neither Fagg nor Rosendale immediately returned requests for comment from The Daily Beast. How exactly Flynn is choosing \xa0which candidates to back this year is somewhat of a mystery. Navarro said that he had met Flynn at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C. and that their friendly interaction \xa0led to his endorsement. Downing told The Daily Beast that a mutual friend told Flynn about his campaign and the two men had a conversation before Flynn was invited to Montana. “He told me you’re going to win this primary and you’re going to defeat Tester,” Downing said. One close friend of Flynn’s, Michael Ledeen, who co-authored the book Field of Fight with the former Lieutenant General, told The Daily Beast that they speak frequently—but not about Flynn’s dabbling with campaign politics. “We talk about the world, we talk about grandchildren,” Ledeen said. “We both have relatively new grandchildren.”Similarly, he claimed, they don’t talk about Flynn’s case or Mueller either. Flynn himself doesn’t appear interested in engaging with the subject on the stump either, relegating attacks against the special counsel to the president himself. During his appearance on behalf of Navarro in March, the former national security adviser sounded like any other political figure boosting a candidate. "What I\'m not here to do is complain about who has done me wrong, or how unfair I\'ve been treated, or how unfair the entire process has been—it is what it is, and my previous statements stand for themselves," Flynn said. "I\'m here to talk about the future—your future, our future, the future of this country. If you feel passionate about something, and feeling sorry for yourself will keep you from achieving that destiny, then I can\'t be a part of that.”'},
 {'title': 'Poll: Ted Cruz vs. Beto O’Rourke Race ‘Too Close to Call’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Months out from the U.S. Senate election in Texas, a new poll from Quinnipiac University found that the race between incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O\'Rourke is "too close to call." Cruz has 47 percent support among Texas voters while O\'Rourke has 44 percent, according to the poll. The poll comes on top of a huge fundraising haul for O’Rourke, a three-term congressman from El Paso. In the first quarter of 2018, O\'Rourke raised over $6.7 million from more than 141,000 contributions. That number was more than double what Cruz raised during the same time period. O\'Rourke raised the money through a unique strategy of using email and social media, live-streaming his nearly every move in every county of the state. (He’s also rejected PAC money.)Money alone is not going to be enough for O’Rourke running in a state that has been unfavorable for Democrats for decades. The last time a Democrat from Texas won a Senate election was 1988. The key factor motivating the shockingly close finding from Quinnipiac appears to be independent voters, whom back O\'Rourke 51 percent to 37 percent for Cruz. There is also an obvious age divide in the poll with younger voters backing O\'Rourke by a 16-point margin and older voters backing Cruz by 7 points. Additionally, the poll found that President Trump\'s approval rating was only 43 percent with 52 percent disapproving. O\'Rourke will still have to work on amplifying himself with Texas voters though, as the poll found that 53 percent of Texas voters don\'t know enough about him to form an opinion. The poll "surveyed 1,029 Texas voters with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points," Quinnipiac said. '},
 {'title': 'Stormy Daniels’ Legal Strategy Strongly Suggests She Has Photos of Donald Trump',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "At first blush, the legal strategy of Stormy Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, appears to make no sense. Daniels is arguing that the October 26, 2016, agreement she signed accepting money in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Donald Trump is null and void because it was not signed by Trump himself. On its surface, this is a poor strategy. While cloaked in pseudonyms, the agreement itself says that it is between three parties: “David Dennison,” i.e. Trump; “Peggy Peterson,” i.e. Stormy Daniels / Stephanie Clifford; and “Essential Consultants” (EC), a consulting company formed by Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, apparently expressly for the purpose of signing this agreement and paying Daniels $130,000 in hush money.Weirdly, the agreement actually says it is between “EC, LLC and/or David Dennison, on the one part” and Daniels on the other. That “and/or” is quite unusual in the recitation of parties to a contract. Either the parties are signatories, or they’re not. The only plausible interpretation of this unusual “and/or” suggests that either EC or Trump is sufficient for the agreement to be binding. The non-signature of Trump/Dennison shouldn’t matter. Moreover, Daniels took the money and, at first, complied with the agreement. As first-year law students learn in school, there’s an offer, there’s acceptance, and there’s consideration – there’s a contract. In fact, courts generally go out of their way to enforce imperfect contracts, even absent these extenuating circumstances. Avenatti’s argument is a reach.It also seems weirdly unnecessary because we already know about the contract and the alleged affair. I’ve reviewed dozens, if not hundreds, of non-disclosure agreements in my life. Pretty much all of them become voided once the confidential information becomes widely known. That’s true even of agreements like this one, which is unusually constructed, outrageously slanted toward one party (guess which one) and intended to keep Daniels silent throughout all eternity and the entire universe no matter what. In this case, when the Wall Street Journal revealed the details of the contract on January 12, 2018, that information stopped being confidential. “I’ve reviewed dozens, if not hundreds, of non-disclosure agreements in my life. Pretty much all of them become voided once the confidential information becomes widely known.”So why not just say that? Why not cite the WSJ report, say the information is no longer confidential, and that’s that? Why seek a declaratory judgment voiding the agreement based on a flimsy theory that Avenatti must know is risky at best?The answer may be in the agreement itself, because it has some unusual provisions in it.First, it’s chiefly concerned with “certain still images and/or text messages.” Yes, later in the agreement, the “confidential information” at issue is expansively defined, to include absolutely anything, tangible or intangible, that Daniels might know about Trump, including, of course, whether she spanked him with a magazine or not.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But far more ink is spilled discussing what Daniels is supposed to do with those texts and images: give copies to Cohen and destroy the originals.Now the strategy starts to make sense. This dispute isn’t about the affair: it’s about those pictures or texts. As viewers of Daniels’ 60 Minutes interview surely noticed, the only question Daniels refused to answer was about whether she’s got more evidence of the affair. Avenatti suggested the answer is yes: he tweeted a photo of a DVD inside a safe. If Daniels has retained copies of pictures or texts, then she is in clear violation of the central parts of the confidentiality agreement. Not only does the agreement explicitly forbid her from keeping copies of images or texts, it actually defines them as Trump’s – oh, sorry, David Dennison’s – personal, copyrighted property. Incidentally, that, too, is quite unusual. Normally, that kind of provision appears in a consultancy or employment agreement. Here, however, it’s been grafted into a confidentiality agreement. If that DVD has pictures of Trump, it is literally Trump’s copyrighted property. Unless, of course, the agreement is null and void.Now the pieces come together. Avenatti wants to void the agreement because that way, Daniels can keep that DVD, or, if you want to be cynical about it, auction it off to the highest bidder. That DVD could be the stained blue dress of this whole scandal: proof positive that the affair took place, that the coverup took place, and that Cohen and Trump are liars. Then again, it might just be a blank DVD in a safe. Now you can see why Avenatti is pursuing this weird and unlikely strategy to say that the agreement was never valid in the first place: that’s the only way for that DVD to matter. Daniels’s statements so far are most likely not violations of the confidentiality agreement, because the information in them is no longer confidential. But whatever’s on that DVD – and all the devastating power incriminating texts or images would have – still is confidential.For now."},
 {'title': 'From Martin Luther King Jr.’s Assassination to the Charleston Massacre, the Reactionary Right Has Used Madness as an Excuse for Violence',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Five days. Martin Luther King, Jr. hadn’t rested in peace for even a week when William F. Buckley Jr. exhumed him for an autopsy and a psychiatric evaluation.On April 9, 1968, Buckley, then perhaps the most influential intellectual on the American right, declared that only madness could have led someone to murder King, who, by the way, probably brought that fate on himself. Having assured readers of his National Review that it “would take a lunatic (his murderer… is sure to be one) to reason that Dr. King’s faults justified assassination,” Buckley then proclaimed that “the cretin who leveled his rifle at the head of Martin Luther King, may have absorbed the talk… about the supremacy of the individual conscience, such talk as Martin Luther King… had so widely, and so indiscriminately, indulged in.” He concluded that the then unknown assassin was a “wildman” driven to his crazed act by the “transgressions” of his obviously flawed victim.That amateurish diagnosis conveniently ignored Buckley’s consistent embrace of violence in defense of white supremacy. By characterizing James Earl Ray as a “lunatic,” Buckley, a devout Roman Catholic, absolved himself of guilt. He omitted his own earlier commandment that “the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail” and that sometimes it “cannot prevail except by violence” to instead manipulate the rhetoric of mental illness that still clouds our understanding of American reactionaries and their violence.By the time Buckley speculated on the mind of King’s assassin, social scientists had spent decades trying to diagnose racism. Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany were their principal subjects, the Holocaust their main motivation. As historian Sander L. Gilman and sociologist James M. Thomas demonstrate in Are Racists Crazy? How Prejudice, Racism, and Antisemitism Became Markers of Insanity, the Nazi genocide of European Jews encouraged research meant to stop the rise of other fascist regimes, avoid further atrocities committed in the name of racial supremacy, and facilitate the rehabilitation of post-World War II Germany. It made it fashionable to pathologize the right. From the 1930s into the 1950s, researchers speculated about the perverse workings of the deviant “authoritarian personality” and questioned whether education could “cure” racism and fascism. They diagnosed the horrors of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen as the terrible symptom of a “paranoid contagion” or “mass psychosis.” \xa0\xa0\xa0Buckley confirmed the unintended consequences of liberals’ well-intentioned social science. During the Jim Crow era, the association of racism and racial violence with mental illness became ammunition for the right-wing defenders of the American-system of racial apartheid that had inspired the Nazis. It helped the National Review and the White Citizens Councils present themselves as respectable and lucid intellectuals and professionals, as fundamentally different from James Earl Ray, the Ku Klux Klan, and the other foot-soldiers of white supremacy.They were not, of course. The ordinary white men, women, and even children who wielded the swords endorsed by Buckley’s pen were neither abnormal nor insane. Instead, their actions were the truest expression of at least one sort of conservatism. They were certainly consistent with Buckley’s demands for the “leaders of American civilization” to dominate by whatever means necessary.For James Baldwin, it was obvious that it wasn’t mental illness but the memories, experience, and aspiration of racial domination that produced this violence. He said as much to Buckley. Three years before the assassination of King, during a debate held before a nearly all-white crowd at the Cambridge Union Society, Baldwin used Jim Clark as an example of how the experience of [white] power corrupted. The notorious sheriff of Selma, Alabama could not be “dismissed as a total monster,” Baldwin began. He told the audience that they had to understand that “[Clark] doesn’t know what drives him to use the club, to menace with the gun and to use the cattle prod.” He was a reactionary in the most literal sense, a man whose instinctive violence in defense of hierarchy proved that the “plague called color” had destroyed “the moral life of Alabama sheriffs” and warped the “American sense of reality.”Baldwin won the debate but it’s Buckley’s ideas that have prevailed. In the five decades since King’s assassination, the association of racism and right-wing violence with mental illness has become more and more common. To be sure, it was the standard trope used to characterize Dylann Roof. After the self-proclaimed white supremacist sat quietly through an entire prayer service before murdering nine parishioners of the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, a FBI special agent went on CNN to declare that Roof “has some mental issues.” Others followed suit. To the mayor of Charleston, the city where thousands of enslaved people first set foot in North America, the mass murder was simply an act of “one hateful person.” To Lindsey Graham, the senator from the first state to declare that the protection of slavery demanded secession from the United States, Roof was just “one of these whacked-out kids.”Of course, Roof refused to plead insanity. Having immersed himself in his genealogy and discovered that he was “blessed with a significant amount of German blood,” having studied the histories presented on right-wing websites and found himself wishing “with a passion that niggers were treated terribly throughout history by Whites, that every White person had an ancestor who owned slaves,” Roof believed himself to be sane. He had simply reacted to the threat of people “taking over our country.” He had only acted according to the same views endorsed on Breitbart and Fox News.That Baldwin was right and Buckley was wrong is a terrible thing to confront. If Roof is sane and rational then so are the millions of other reactionaries who imbibe the same news. Violence or its threat then become essential means of preserving racial hierarchy rather than aberrant elements of an otherwise rational social order. The alt-right begins to look more like the center.And yet these are hard truths that must be faced on the fiftieth anniversary of King’s assassination. While the prophet of non-violence in defense of universal equality argued that racism was a product of white Americans’ “irrational fears” of losing individual and collective political, economic, and social power, he also rejected “the idea that the dominant ideology in our country even today is freedom and equality while racism is just an occasional departure from the norm on the part of a few bigoted extremists.” He anticipated the diagnosis of his assassin, of Roof, of Donald Trump and the “Unite the Right” fascists and rejected it; instead he called on America to face the “‘congenital deformity’ of racism that has crippled the nation from its inception.”'},
 {'title': 'Putin’s Top MMA Fighter: Backed by Trump, Busted by the FBI',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Russian fighter was in Chicago, killing time with his entourage in the days before a mixed martial arts bout, when the call came.FBI agents were looking for him. A fearsome heavyweight known as “The Last Emperor”—and who’s beloved by Russian President Vladimir Putin—Fedor Emelianenko had been in America for only five days before the feds appeared at his hotel near O’Hare Airport on Tuesday, April 24.A decade before, Emelianenko had headlined an MMA league championed by Donald Trump and his personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. The outfit went bust after only two fights. Now, Cohen is the subject of a major federal investigation. Two weeks prior to the rendezvous with Emelianenko, the FBI raided Cohen’s New York home, office, and hotel room in search of records related to his payout to porn star Stormy Daniels in the run-up to Election Day. (Cohen is also reportedly being eyed by special counsel Robert Mueller in his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.)Jerry Millen, Emelianenko’s manager, declined to discuss what the G-men asked the 41-year-old warrior, who won his Bellator slugfest in 48 seconds four days later. The FBI interview was first reported by The Telegraph of London, then the Associated Press.“His thing is inflicting death on people. He’s abnormally strong.”— Donald Trump, on Fedor Emelianenko“They told us they’d be at the fight on Saturday,” Millen said of the federal agent and a translator, who came from the FBI’s Chicago bureau and chatted up Emelianenko for 20 minutes before handing him their business cards. “They said they’d be in plainclothes and we won’t know they’re there.”When asked if Emelianenko has a relationship with Cohen, Millen replied, “Not that I know of.”It’s unclear whether the FBI interest in Emelianenko, a slightly pudgy bruiser with a shaved head and stony gaze, is connected to either inquiry. But Millen, who partnered with Trump on a failed reality TV show featuring Emelianenko, said everything the MMA legend does is above board. “Fedor is one of the best people I know,” Millen added. “He’s not involved in any goofy shit at all.”Millen wants President Trump to attend Emelianenko’s next fight in the fall. And he hopes the Russian president will make it, too. “It would cause havoc, but if Trump and Putin want to meet, why not meet at Fedor’s fight?” Millen told The Daily Beast. “Fedor works for Putin,” Millen said. “He’s very close to Mr. Putin and a big supporter of Mr. Putin and he’ll probably go back to work, after this is all over, for the government of Russia as sports ambassador.” Indeed, Emelianenko was a member of Putin’s United Russia Party and in 2012 was placed on the Russian president’s sports advisory council. “Donald Trump loves Fedor,” the manager added. “So what better place to meet [than] at the next Bellator event?”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.When asked if his dreams of a Putin-Trump showdown was all talk, Millen answered, “If I can make it happen, I will. I think it’d be awesome if Trump and Putin were in the ring together for a Fedor fight.” Emelianenko was linked to the future American president as early as 2008, when the Affliction apparel company launched an MMA league in answer to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).Before Affliction’s MMA venture, the UFC had prohibited its fighters from wearing Affliction duds during events. “I don’t like the way they do business,” UFC President Dana White told Bleacher Report of the clothing line, which had been sponsoring the sport’s fighters. In response, Affliction launched a league of its own.“I think it’d be awesome if Trump and Putin were in the ring together for a Fedor fight.”— Jerry Millen, Fedor Emelianenko’s managerEnter Donald Trump.In May of that year, at a press conference at Trump Tower, the real estate mogul declared his partnership with Affliction and announced its first pay-per-view fight. Emelianenko would be the star of the July 2008 bout—titled “Affliction: Banned,” in a nod to the turf war with the UFC.Trump held another presser one month later to announce the signing of Belarusian fighter Andrei Arlovski. “I’ve got a lot of money. That helps, right? But also and perhaps more importantly, I seem to get a lot of attention,” Trump told reporters.“If we make money, that’s great,” Trump added, “I think we will. I think it will be successful. What I do is usually successful.”Cohen was named Affliction Entertainment’s chief operating officer in a press release touting “Banned,” which drew thousands of fans to the Honda Center in Anaheim, California, and starred a Megadeth performance. Cohen said he was “nearly speechless” that Trump and Affliction trusted him to make MMA magic happen.“This is like having Ali, Frazier, Tyson, Holyfield and other top heavyweights all on the same boxing card,” Cohen said at the time. “It’s unprecedented and will revolutionize the way MMA fans view this sport.”Even Donald Trump Jr. was touting MMA, a sport John McCain once called “human cockfighting.” Trump Jr. told Men’s Fitness the Trump Organization was investing money in Affliction, not just providing name recognition. “We’re obviously a very cash-rich company,” he said. “So we can come into something to make sure it’s done appropriately. Depending on how everything goes, if we have to put in more, we’ll put in more.”Tom Atencio, then-vice president of Affliction MMA, said he and Todd Beard, Affliction clothing’s late president, dreamed up the idea to host bouts of their own in competition with the UFC. Beard died in 2014.Trump got involved through mutual business associates, Atencio said. Meanwhile, Millen claims that a manufacturer of men’s suits introduced Beard to Trump. (Back then, Millen was vice president of M-1 Global, an MMA promoter based in St. Petersburg, Russia, which co-promoted Affliction events.)Despite Trump’s grandstanding, it’s unclear whether his company had a financial stake in the fight club or simply licensed his name. “I really can’t speak about it,” Atencio told The Daily Beast. “I guess the easiest way to say it: It was a lot different than the public understood it to be. At the time, we did things just like any other business. It’s kind of a facade, if you will. Nothing is always as it seems.”Trump, along with boxing promoter Oscar De La Hoya, was brought in to make MMA a mainstream sport, Atencio said. “It got in the mainstream media because of him,” Atencio said of Trump. Atencio said he met with Cohen, the chief operating officer, a few times for lunch but that “at the end of the day, he was really Donald Trump’s lawyer and had nothing to do with the events.” Atencio said he got “a big kick out of” seeing Cohen’s COO title in recent news reports.“He told me that he studied martial arts.”— Former Affliction VP Tom Atencio, on Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen“He told me that he studied martial arts,” Atencio said of Cohen. “He was a really nice guy. [But] he wasn’t involved in any of the operations or putting things together. Nothing.” They would have lunch again after Affliction’s collapse, when Atencio visited New York.All three Affliction events featured Emelianenko as the main event. But the company, which was hemorrhaging cash on glitz and payroll, folded before the third bout, “Affliction: Trilogy,” which was scheduled for August 2009. Emelianenko was slated to battle Josh “The Babyfaced Assassin” Barnett, who tested positive for steroids weeks before the event. Affliction pulled the plug, claiming they couldn’t find a replacement.“I always said in the media... it was our third event and had we broke even or at least gotten close to breaking even, we would have continued to move forward,” Atencio said. Yet Emelianenko and M-1 sued Affliction two months later, saying Barnett wasn’t the reason the league went under. According to the lawsuit, which alleged a breach of contract, Emelianenko was to fight a minimum of three bouts, for $300,000 each, plus travel and accommodation expenses.The Russian brawler claimed M-1 helped to secure a new opponent, Brett Rogers. He also claimed he informed Affliction he was willing to pit himself against several other fighters, including Bobby Lashley, court papers state. Emelianenko accused Affliction of having ulterior motives. The league was secretly securing a sponsorship deal with UFC and failed to inform him of their intention to cancel “Affliction: Trilogy,” the complaint claimed. On July 24, 2009, as the fighter was on a plane bound for Los Angeles with a 30-man entourage, the UFC and Affliction were allegedly negotiating the upstart league’s demise. When Emelianenko landed in L.A., he learned his third matchup was toast, his lawsuit alleged. The parties settled the case in August 2011, court records show. Attorneys for both sides declined to comment to The Daily Beast. Mike Bassiri, then general counsel for Affliction, said he helped negotiate contracts with the fighters and the venues. He declined to answer whether Trump invested in Affliction’s MMA arm but said the company’s T-shirt business, along with pay-per-view revenues, financed most of the fight productions.When asked if Trump took legal action after Affliction shuttered, Bassiri said no. Asked about a potential settlement with Trump, he answered, “I can’t discuss that with you. I’m sorry.” MMA was blowing up, Bassiri recalls, and Trump wanted to be a part of it. Emelianenko was at the center of another failed enterprise backed by Trump: a reality TV series called “Fighting Fedor.” Millen pitched the 15-episode project, which was supposed to be taped in St. Petersburg, Russia. In October 2008, Affliction announced it would begin filming the show, which would send 16 unknown fighters to Russia for a chance to battle Emelianenko. Trump and M-1 Global were listed as partners.“I don’t know who is going to make it through, but whoever it is will be incredible,” Trump said in a press release for the Soviet spectacular, adding, “I’m going to be there, but I don’t want to compete on the show.”Filming for the series never got off the ground. Millen said internal disagreements led to the project’s downfall, especially after he left M-1 Global and Affliction’s MMA bid failed. “We just didn’t do it,” Millen said.“Emelianenko was at the center of another failed enterprise backed by Trump: a reality TV series called "Fighting Fedor."”Still, Trump sat ringside for Affliction’s pair of California contests. Melania Trump joined him for at least one, according to an Orange County Register columnist who attended Affliction’s sophomore battle in January 2009. “I think it’s very brutal,” Melania told the reporter. “But it’s a business and a sport.”Donald Trump interrupted her and declared, “You know why she comes? Because she has no choice.” (The OC scribe, who was on the hunt for female MMA fans, also spotted Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag from MTV’s The Hills and porn star Jenna Jameson, who was dating MMA fighter and Apprentice contestant Tito Ortiz.)“You know why she comes? Because she has no choice.”— Donald Trump, on Melania Trump’s appearance at an MMA fightThree days before “Affliction: Banned,” Trump appeared on The Howard Stern Show to plug his foray into MMA. “We have Fedor the Russian who has never been defeated,” Trump boasted, adding, “His thing is inflicting death on people. He’s abnormally strong.“His neck, I think it’s like 28 inches,” the now-president added.Trump told Stern he loves boxing, but that the sport has “lost an edge” and “you get tired of it.” He suggested MMA quenched a need for something more violent. “Well, this way, it’s sort of like… somebody dies,” Trump said. “I’ve never seen anything like it, and it’s terrible… It’s not like ‘Oh, how are the judges voting,’ OK. It’s like, you know, somebody just succumbs.”'},
 {'title': 'Now What Will Conservatives Say About Gorsuch?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The expression “But Gorsuch” needs to be updated to “Et tu, Gorsuch?” after Donald Trump’s “first and most important accomplishment” as the White House has put it, sided with the four liberal Supreme Court justices in a decision this week. Adding insult to injury, Gorsuch was the deciding vote in a 5-4 ruling against Jeff Sessions and the Trump administration’s efforts to achieve one of its primary objectives: deporting immigrants who have committed crimes. And per The Washington Post, Trump was “incensed that Gorsuch had voted against the administration on an immigration case.”Think about that for a moment. Gorsuch, a man Trump has repeatedly praised, even awkwardly in front of him at this year’s State of the Union, ruled against the Trump administration and allowed a man who had committed burglary twice to remain in the United States. Add to that, conservatives have frequently cited Gorsuch as the primary, if not sole, reason to still support Trump despite both his decidedly non-conservative views on certain issues and his bigotry such as defending\xa0white supremacists in Charlottesville last August as “fine people.” In fact, “But Gorsuch” became a meme for how those on the right continued to embrace Trump at all costs. This also holds true for some on the religious right who have called Gorsuch’s appointment a “bright star in a dark sky.”  Well, so much for all that. In the decision released Tuesday, Trump’s golden boy Gorsuch joined in the opinion written by liberal Justice Elena Kagan to strike down a provision of the Immigration and Naturalization Act that called for the deportation of any non-citizen, including legal immigrants like defendant James Dimaya, who was twice convicted of burglary under California state law. The four liberal justices, together with the conservative savior Gorsuch, ruled that the law was unconstitutionally vague because it didn’t adequately define what constituted a “crime of violence.” The result is Dimaya remains in the United States.The five majority justices made a nuanced legal argument that relied on a prior decision authored by the late Justice Scalia. While this makes for great discussion in the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court and in law schools across the country, in the real world, Gorsuch’s decision has sparked outrage among the very people who had once lavishly praised him. Headlines in conservative publications give you a sense of how irate they are. One read, “WHOA! Gorsuch just sided with liberal justices in an immigration ruling against Trump!” Others blared, “5-4: Gorsuch Sides With Court’s Liberals In, Er, Deportation Case” and “Gorsuch Casts Deciding Vote on Immigration Case—It May Surprise You.” Breitbart.com ran an interview of a former immigration judge blasting the ruling, warning Americans that “very dangerous aliens” are not going to be deported because of this decision and also published another piece claiming that “Migrants’\xa0lawyers celebrated the\xa0decision.”\xa0And over on the Drudge Report, comments to the decision included one reader asking: “I wonder if Pres Trump is going to start attacking Associate Justice Gorsuch via Twitter?”Well, Trump did actually take to Twitter Tuesday to vent over this decision with two tweets that combined to read: “Today’s Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by.... Congress—House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. Keep America Safe!” And while Trump vented privately about Gorsuch, he obviously can’t go after Gorsuch by name or with a derogatory nickname like\xa0#NothingNeal. That would’ve brought even more attention to the fact that the person Trump touted as “a man of great and unquestioned integrity” and whom he praised at last April’s NRA national convention as “really something very special" had cast the deciding vote against his administration to stop the deportation of an immigrant who had committed two crimes. But make no bones about it, it’s clear that there was no joy in the Trump administration. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security put out a sharply worded statement slamming the decision, invoking very Trumpian themes: “Today’s ruling significantly undermines DHS’s efforts to remove aliens convicted of certain violent crimes… By preventing the federal government from removing known criminal aliens, it allows our nation to be a safe haven for criminals and makes us more vulnerable as a result.”Could this be the beginning of Trump’s worst nightmare about Gorsuch coming true? Trump last year reportedly shared with Republican congressional leaders his concerns about his nominee to the high court: "He\'s probably going to end up being\xa0a liberal like the rest of them.” Adding, "You never know with these guys.”True, there’s a history of Supreme Court Justices moving ideologically once on the bench. The most famous recent example was of former Justice David Souter who had been nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 but ending up shocking the right by up consistently voting with the liberal members of the Court. That’s not likely with Gorsuch. But one or two more decisions like Gorsuch made in Sessions v. Dimaya and there goes Trump’s “first and most important accomplishment” down the drain. And it also puts pressure on conservatives who claim they were still on board with Trump solely because of “But Gorsuch” to come up with a new excuse for why they are supporting a man who has espoused non-conservative views and trafficked in bigotry, racism and sexism to win the White House.'},

  'body': "Some of you will recall that back in the Dubya era, a good chunk of the pundit class decided after the 9/11 attacks that America needed a hero, so they set about converting Bush into Churchill. Well, sometimes Churchill, other times Gary Cooper. The Churchill line was met with more derision, but I actually found the latter comparison much more offensive than the former. Gary Cooper never shot first. That was the entire basis of his moral authority.Anyway. Turning this scraggly, Vietnam-ducking rich kid into a macho figurine required the concomitant feminization of the Democratic Party. Some among you will remember the book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, an early 1990s self-help book. Neocon Robert Kagan appropriated the title for an Iraq-era polemical book of his own, Americans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus. By Americans, of course, Kagan really meant war-loving Americans, who were Martian in their ardor for combat, while Europeans and other Americans—mostly Democrats and women—were from Venus (the Roman goddess of love, you see).I couldn’t help think of all this Wednesday morning as I read the news of all the smashing electoral victories by Democratic women in Pennsylvania and Nebraska and elsewhere. Six women won Democratic primaries, and two more came within a hair’s breadth. This in a state that currently has 18 congressmen, emphasis on the “men” part. The Venusification of the Democratic Party is on, and this man says it’s high time.I’m not trying to get some PC ticket punched. I’m not exactly Alan Alda (that’s a reference that dates me, but some of you will know what I mean). I like football, and bourbon, and the riff of “Under My Thumb,” although the lyrics do make me wince a little. I may not be Alan Alda, but actually, now that I think about it, I have considered myself a feminist of some stripe or another since I was about 11 years old, when my sister, Susan, then in college, came home bending my ear about Simone de Beauvoir and Germaine Greer and all the rest. My sister was cool (you still are, if you’re reading!), so if she liked it, I liked it. She brought home a Shirley Chisholm for President button. I tacked it on my bedroom wall. She came with armfuls of issues of Ms., which I kinda-sorta looked through—while, I freely admit, I also eagerly tore through her National Lampoons searching for those gratuitous breast shots that were always and unfailingly in there.You see, it’s possible to be both things at once. There’s no room for portraits of people who contain such seeming contradictions (though they are not contradictions at all!) in the media, where you have to be either this or that. But millions of men are not this or that. We love sports and raunchy rock ’n’ roll and Sean Connery (except when he slaps them—that has really aged badly). But we’ve grown up a little since we were 18, we don’t make pu**y jokes, and we detest and are embarrassed by men like Donald Trump.And we want to be part—we demand that we be part—of a political movement and party and country where women are equal. Not necessarily for the sake of fairness or diversity, although those things are important. But because women being equal in politics will make the country and world a better and more interesting place.How do I know this? For one thing, because women are smarter about Donald Trump overall than men are, and women have driven the anti-Trump resistance. Read the piece from February in the journal I edit by Theda Skocpol and Lara Putnam. Many people described it as the best account they’ve read of how the resistance actually works (in this case, in Pennsylvania). It’s almost all powered by women.In the first year of his presidency, Trump’s approval rating gender gap averaged 12 points—45 percent of men backed him, and just 33 percent of women. That’s twice the gap of the previous three presidents. Women are much smarter about the guy. And more recently, Trump’s ratings have fallen even more with women and risen among men (that is, the type of men who think it’s cool the president shagged a hot porn star and then paid her to be quiet).Another reason more women in politics will make things better is that women are more likely to define “economics” in a way I think we need to define it these days in terms of social policy. That’s a little dry, but what I mean is this: “Economics,” historically, as discussed by men, has meant supply, demand, and growth. But when women think of economics, they are more likely to think of it in terms that are directly relevant to how middle-class families can get by today, as the economist Heather Boushey has written, also in the pages of my (apparently aggressively Venutian) journal. Those are just the policies this country so desperately needs today, and women are far more likely than men to execute them.So we need change. And we are way, way behind. In terms of the percentage of women serving in our national legislature(s), we rank 102nd in the world (out of 193). Saudi Arabia is 100th. Number one, oddly, is Rwanda, which I guess is proof that women don’t automatically fix everything, although who knows what else is going on there. But to take some countries we feel closest to, the U.K. is 41, France is 16, Canada is 60, Germany is 46. All well ahead of us. The country Trump is trying to turn us into, Russia, is 129.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

To return to our ersatz Churchill, his birthday is July 6. That’s when my daughter was born, which I was bummed out about at first, until I told myself that’s OK, someday they’ll note that George W.

 {'title': 'Why Should Gina Haspel Take the Fall for All the Bad Guys?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Bashing Gina Haspel, nominated to be CIA director, for her role torturing captives may be deserved, but she should not be carrying that curse alone. What’s worse, because she’s a woman being fingered for something that was dreamed up by a gang of bad guys in Washington this could easily acquire the unpleasant odor of a sexist lynching.A lot of people (on the left as well as the right) have spent years trying to salve their consciences for failing to see at the time where the Bush administration’s knee-jerk response to the 9/11 attacks was going to take us—first by responding to terrorism with terrorism and then by launching the Iraq War.Collective moral amnesia might have served to cover up the crimes for a while but that time has long passed. And with a current president who has endorsed waterboarding and said he’s in favor of “much, much worse” it’s important to take a clear-eyed look at how this mess was devised and whether much has really been learned from it. After 9/11 the country was gripped by what could be called retribution fever.The real effects of that fever on policy emerged on Feb. 7, 2002, when President George W. Bush signed a two-page memorandum with the hideously perverted title of “Humane Treatment of Taliban and al Qaeda Detainees.” The thrust of this memo was that the U.S. should no longer abide by the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war.The White House counsel, Alberto Gonzalez, had advised Bush that the war on terror could not be fought according to the old rules: “This new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva’s strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions requiring that captured enemy be afforded such things as commissary privileges.” (Telling choice of language when fundamental human rights become “quaint.”)Secretary of State General Colin Powell pushed back against the policy, warning that it would jeopardize American troops and not yield any value in intelligence. But he was ignored. Moreover, in an atmosphere of mindless bloodlust there was a hard core of zealots who demanded a far more explicit legal basis for torture. The hardest of these hard core advocates was David Addington, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff and legal adviser. Another lawyer in the Bush administration at the time said Addington was “an unopposable force.” Cheney and Addington were in lockstep in believing that the war on terror justified and required extreme measures including torture (“enhanced interrogation”) and unauthorized surveillance. Later they cooked up fake intelligence on nonexistent weapons of mass destruction to justify the Iraq War—with the help of Trump’s incoming adviser on national security, John Bolton.Addington was an elusive and secretive figure—he kept the door of his office locked at all times because, he said, it contained so many secret files. Few photographs of him existed and he never gave interviews. And he was the hidden driving force behind what became known as the Torture Manifesto.This was a series of secret memos issued on Aug. 1, 2002, signed by a trio of lawyers, John Yoo, deputy assistant attorney general, and Jay S. Bybee and Steven Bradbury, both of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. (Addington did not sign them, nor did Gonzalez, who was also deeply involved.) The memos authorized and described with pitiless precision the methods of torture, ranging from waterboarding to physical humiliation, that could be used on prisoners and detainees. When they were released under the orders of President Obama in 2009 The New York Times editorialized: “Their language is the precise bureaucratese favored by dungeon masters throughout history. They detail how to fashion a collar for slamming prisoners against a wall, exactly how many days he can be kept without sleep (11) and what, specifically, he should be told before being locked in a box with an insect.”The appalling consequences of this regime were for the first time revealed in April 2004, when The New Yorker reported the grotesque physical abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib military prison in Iraq. This was, however, just one site of many where outrages had been committed.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Two years earlier Gina Haspel had overseen torture at a secret prison in Thailand, known as Detention Site Green, where a Saudi-born Palestinian, Abu Zubaydah, accused of being a senior al Qaeda operative, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, suspected of bombing the USS Cole, were interrogated. (According to The New York Times, Haspel took over after Zubaydah was interrogated but was there when al-Nashiri was tortured.) Zubaydah, it later turned out, had not been a senior al Qaeda player and the torture program failed to produce any significant intelligence.\xa0The Financial Times has reported that “a person familiar with the program” said: “We were kidnapping people, putting them into footlockers with snakes, we were using contractors. It was a mess—at the time there was nobody complaining or, if there was, they said it in a whisper.”In 2005 Jose Rodriguez, the CIA’s counterterrorism chief,\xa0ordered Haspel to proceed with the destruction of 92 videotapes recording the interrogations at Detention Site Green. According to an account by Ali Soufan, a former FBI counterterrorism agent, in The Atlantic, in doing so Rodriguez defied both the CIA’s general counsel and a federal court order but nonetheless Haspel followed his orders.Crucial details about Haspel’s actions are still unknown. For example, what were the agency’s protocols that governed the destruction of evidence? Where was she by then in the hierarchy of command? How much autonomy was given to those in charge of black sites? And, critically, how far was the Torture Manifesto, after it became authorized doctrine in 2002, knowingly used and obeyed by those who did the torturing?Of course, the phrase “I was just carrying out orders” has a chilling association with the monstrous war crimes of World War II.\xa0And, as it happened, it was in the wake of that war that a taste for “enhanced interrogation” techniques first entered the CIA’s bloodstream. During the war American intelligence had been run by the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, but this was disbanded in 1945, and not replaced until the CIA was created in 1947.The interregnum remains a murky period in European history. The three Western powers, Britain, France, and the U.S., occupied zones of West Germany while the Soviets controlled East Germany. In the West military intelligence services were hunting down agents of the German Communist Party who were often directed by Soviet agents. In the American zone this work was directed by the army’s Counter-Intelligence Corps, the CIC, and the CIC was not too fussy about the people it recruited to work for it if they displayed the required experience and skills—for example, former Nazi officials for whom the communists were an old and hated adversary. The most egregious of these recruits was Klaus Barbie, who had served as the head of the Gestapo in the French city of Lyons during the war, where he was known as “The Butcher of Lyons.” Barbie was wanted by the French as a war criminal. Among his crimes was the execution of at least 5,000 members of the underground French resistance, including one of their leaders, Jean Moulin, and the murder of 44 Jewish orphans who were sent to Auschwitz.Barbie had developed particularly sadistic and obscene interrogation methods, including skinning prisoners alive, extreme even by the standards of the Gestapo. Now he lived in official U.S. government housing in the city of Augsburg and worked for the CIC, helping to penetrate a network of communist agents and interrogate those who were arrested. After 1947 the CIC unit in Augsburg served as a front for the CIA and this is where some of Barbie’s less extreme Gestapo interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, seem to have been incorporated into standard procedure.This kind of treatment was able to happen because the occupation zones were predominantly policed by the military and the military enjoyed wide scope in the methods they used as the Cold War intensified. (This dark and morally ambiguous world was brilliantly captured in the movie classic The Third Man.)The French intelligence services eventually discovered that Barbie was working for the Americans. At first the CIA denied this. But with further insistence by France that he be arrested and delivered to them he was spirited, under an alias, to Bolivia where he worked, along with other ex-Nazis, for the authoritarian regime and is widely believed to helped in the capture of Che Guevara by the Bolivian army in 1967.In 1983 a new Bolivian government finally extradited Barbie to France and in 1987 he stood trial and was sentenced to life for crimes against humanity. He died in prison four years later. For years the CIA claimed that it had “absolutely no contact or involvement with Barbie” but in 2000 part of the record revealing his work for the CIC was released and a fuller disclosure was made in 2007.This is not a line of work in which women normally get a lot of attention. Haspel worked for a long time under cover, which means that much of what she did remains as inscrutable as she herself seems to be. As a result, it’s impossible to tell if she learned anything from the results of the operations in Thailand. Far from producing actionable intelligence, the torturing of suspects produced very little of value. It undermined and endangered undercover intelligence gathering both in the Middle East and in Muslim communities in Europe, and this was devastatingly revealed by what happened in Britain, in a case that showed that at least one woman intelligence chief would not be cowed by the macho proponents of extreme interrogations.From the beginning of the CIA’s post-9/11 anti-terrorist operations they had a close partner in Britain’s foreign intelligence service, MI6. The British sanctioned and participated in the euphemistically named “renditions” in which suspects were captured and flown in “white tail” jets to black sites like Detention Site Green for interrogation.None of this troubled the morally malleable British prime minister, Tony Blair. But it deeply riled the head of his country’s domestic counterintelligence service, MI5—who happened to be a woman (the second woman to run it) Eliza Manningham-Buller.In 2004 MI6 and the CIA collaborated in seizing Abdul Hakim Belhaj, an exiled opponent of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. (At the time Blair’s policy was to cultivate Gaddafi as an opponent of Islamic terrorism.) Belhaj was picked up in Bangkok and flown to Libya where some of his interrogators were from MI6—later, when Belhaj was released after the fall of Gaddafi, he said he had been regularly tortured and denied a bath for three years.This episode gained renewed attention on Friday, when Sen. John McCain sent a letter to Haspel with 12 questions about her role in interrogations. McCain cited evidence that Belhaj’s wife, Fatima Bouchar, “was bound, gagged, and photographed naked as several American intelligence officers watched.” He asked: “Do you believe actions like these were justified, and do you believe they produced actionable intelligence?”Bouchar was pregnant at the time, McCain said.Manningham-Buller was a formidable no-nonsense spymaster. (Her father, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, was attorney general in a Tory government and earned the nickname Sir Reginald Bullying Manner.) When she discovered that MI6 had colluded with the CIA in kidnapping and torturing Belhaj she went ballistic. MI5 was on a war footing in Britain. Its priority was building a clandestine network of counterterrorism agents among Britain’s Muslim population to detect and prevent domestic attacks. This would be brought home with painful clarity in 2005 when terrorist bombings in London killed 56 people and injured hundreds more.Manningham-Buller wrote to Blair strongly complaining that MI6 and the CIA were jeopardizing MI5’s intelligence gathering and even that they could have compromised informants if it was known that Britain collaborated in torturing suspects. She removed and permanently banned a detachment of MI6 officers who worked at the offices of MI5. Would Haspel, in a similar situation, show the same kind of iron in dealing with a president? Particularly if that president is pre-disposed to using torture?Former CIA Director John Brennan was at pains to take a balanced view when he predicted that her appointment would be confirmed by the Senate: “She has tremendous respect within the ranks,” he said, but added that “she was involved in a very, very controversial program.” Leon Panetta, another former director, told NPR: “I would hope that the Senate will look at her entire CIA career. Obviously there are questions about her at that point in time… she’s a pretty dedicated CIA officer who in my experience always did her job and did it well. But it is important for the Senate to ask those questions, because I think the United States needs to know that they do have a CIA director who understands what torture’s all about, but also understands what the responsibility of providing solid intelligence is all about.”\xa0The director of the CIA’s office of public affairs has said that “the American people will get the chance to know Ms Haspel for the first time in the coming weeks.”But is it actually possible ever to adequately know and understand someone who rose so high by doing work that even now cannot be fully disclosed and some of which will always be disreputable? Gina Haspel’s problem is that, like many before her, she is tainted because she played the role of the loyal accomplice in a bad regime. After all, she could have simply said “No” to doing the dirty work. But let’s at least remember that the architects of that regime, directed by the chicken hawk\xa0Cheney, were all guys who paid no price. "},
 {'title': 'Sex Scandals and ‘America First’: Warren G. Harding Was Donald Trump 1.0',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A critically inexperienced candidate, running on an “America First” platform, who isn’t supposed to be his party’s nominee, goes on to win the presidency. Moving into the White House, he begins immediately upending tradition.As allegations of cronyism and womanizing swirl about, he sets the nation on an isolationist course while inarticulately advancing confused and often discordant policies which will build his administration’s legacy of scandal and indictment...Err... sorry. But that’s 1921.Comparison between the current and previous Republican presidencies is inevitable. Unavoidable, actually, as Trump continues glorifying himself in unschooled comparisons to Reagan, Eisenhower, even Lincoln. The plain truth, however, is that in his first year, he has proven closer—far closer than anyone may care to imagine—to another Republican president, the incredibly underappreciated Warren Gamaliel Harding. Step by reactionary step, campaign promise by promise and character flaw by flaw, the two are uncannily matched.Except, by comparison to the massive legislative record Harding rolled up in just nine calendar months, Trump has dick to show.Trump’s freshman year in office produced scant legislative result. Pronounced intentions, the border wall and health care repeal, for example, proved elusive. Yes, there were countless presidential signatures concerning regulation rollbacks—but by the measure of enacting significant legislation, Trump’s major success amounts to one Supreme Court replacement and a struggled-up Hail Mary! It’s Christmas in December tax reform bill of partisan support. Harding, in contrast, was the very model of one-party expedience and within months of his March 4 inauguration, Congress had completely remade America's immigration policy, passed historic tax reform, re-monopolized the telecommunications industry and funded a substantial national infrastructure program—all before December recess.Harding’s Republican administration mostly refuted the progressive anti-monopoly, interventionalist policies which had arguably dominated American politics since Theodore Roosevelt. In May, for example, Harding signed the Johnson Quota Act (The Emergency Immigration Act of 1921) which was, in effect, the most significant piece of immigration legislation in U.S. history to date. Johnson redefined America's immigration policy, formally establishing quotas on historic immigration patterns. Largely limiting entry to 3 percent of any nation’s resident U.S. population (as established in the 1910 census) Johnson favored immigration patterns from European nations and as a result, in the following year, U.S. immigration fell approximately 60 percent to slightly over 300,000 entries.In 1924, the Republican-led Congress tightened these draconian limits even further, establishing a 2 percent limit on an even older census. As far as huge tax cuts meant to spur economic expansion, Harding was the original poster boy. Dramatically reducing taxes on higher income brackets, the Revenue Act of November 1921 also established a 10 percent percent rate on net corporate income and provided preferential treatment to capital gains. These substantial “reforms” did not, in fact, go as far as then Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon had proposed. Eight years later, still secretary of the Treasury, serving his third consecutive Republican president, Mellon presided over the Wall Street crash of 1929. As consistency had become a Republican trait, Mellon remained in charge of the Treasury until February 1932, when—threatened with congressional impeachment—he accepted appointment as ambassador to Great Britain.In terms of infrastructure, unlike many, Harding effectively achieved innovative infrastructure legislation in his first year. The National Highway or The Phipps Act, signed in November 1921, established the groundwork for a national highway system, creating the initial gridwork for roads and bridges still in use today.Concerning effect upon the judiciary, Trump and Harding are at a technical draw over major judicial appointments. The advantage however would have to go to Harding whose nomination of former President Taft as Chief Justice in Spring, 1921, arguably trumps Trump’s naming of Neil Gorsuch as an Associate. Similarly, Trump has a high hill to climb to even approach Harding’s accomplishment of four Supreme Court appointments in a single term. Doubly impressive, if you consider that Harding survived in office just 29 months.Where Trump and Harding seem irreparably twinned is their respective lack of qualification for higher public office, their somewhat darker personality traits, and perhaps most sadly, their shared inability to articulate themselves.

Trump beat a field of known challengers with an unorthodox axe-handle-like bullying style. Harding, a first-term Ohio senator, was a machine candidate, famously emerged from a “smoke-filled room” at a deadlocked convention. Harding finally secured the nomination on the tenth round.In the words of Ohio boss turned campaign manager turned Harding’s U.S. Attorney General Harry M. Daughtery, he “looked presidential.”Both Harding and Trump’s appeal was undeniably populist. The 1920 election was historic. Harding first pledged the idea of “a return to normalcy” at a Boston campaign rally in May, 1920. (Equally unproven in national politics, Trump rode an escalating promises to “Make America Great Again” before notably reviving Harding’s original campaign slogan of “America First.”) While argument persists whether “normalcy” is correct usage (as opposed to “normality”) it reverberation has done little since to enhance Harding's reputation as a public speaker. In an era before radio, talkies and Tweets, we know Harding sounded presidential from wax cylinder recordings, possessing a deep stentorian voice and a polished oratory style. By general agreement—including his own—he had precious little to say of any real consequence. Harding himself called his use of regional colloquial, the practice of “bloviation.” A stump style of speech-making he described “the art of speaking for as long as the occasion warrants, and saying nothing.”Grown before microphones and public address systems, it was the style which fired up evangelical campgrounds and inspired assemblies under canvas tents—a style which Harding first developed as a Chautauqua speaker, beginning in 1908 when he first supplemented his salary as Ohio’s Lt Governor, lecturing on Alexander Hamilton. Effectively impressive to the throng, it drove his opponents and critics batshit crazy. Democrat William Gibbs McAdoo, Wilson’s Treasury Secretary (and son-in-law)—hoping to run for the presidency—decried it a “big bowwow style of speaking.”Indeed, the most often-cited summarization of Harding’s speaking ability (which has appeared on the White House’s own website since George W. Bush) remains McAdoo’s description of “an army of pompous sounding phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea.” (The phrase concludes: “sometimes these meandering words would actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly as a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and overwork.”)No less a writer than H.L. Mencken made Harding a franchise. Regularly aghast at Harding’s pronouncements, which he dubbed “Gamaliese,” Mencken was responsible for a quote which has been in great revival these past 13 months. “On some great and glorious day,” he wrote in the Baltimore Evening Sun on July 26, 1920, ”the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.”The first presidential election after the World War, the 1920 election was a bellwether. Hallmarked as the first in which the 19th Amendment, allowing women the vote, went into nation-wide effect, it was also held under the imminent arrival of Prohibition. Harding fought the election largely from his Ohio front porch—a revival of McKinley’s campaign style—where silent cameras recorded his image. On occasion, enthusiastic crowds of supporters were brought in by trains to hear him speak at a local stadium.On Election Day, having outspent Democrats by four-to-one, Harding took office with over 60 percent of the popular vote. An unprecedented mark and one achieved since by only Roosevelt, Johnson, and Nixon.Morality plagued both candidates. Twice-divorced in tabloid headline circumstance, Trump continues to heatedly deny allegations of sexual harassment and scabrous behavior prior to his election, even as victims, witnesses, and enablers parade steadily forward.Again though the advantage clearly goes to Harding, who somehow managed to conduct a long-term affair with one mistress while fathering a daughter with another woman at the same time and while in the White House, and somehow managing to keep everything concealed until, as the White House website concedes, “the summer of 1923 when he died unexpectedly in California, shortly before the public learned of the major scandals facing his administration.”A death, many historians entertain was a poisoning by his extremely pissed-off and “I’ve had just about enough of this” wife."},
 {'title': 'Hillary Clinton on Election Night: ‘They Were Never Going to Let Me Be President’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "“No one in modern politics, male or female, has had to withstand more indignities, setbacks and cynicism. She developed protective armor that made the real Hillary Clinton an enigma. But if she was guarded about her feelings and opinions, she believed it was in careful pursuit of a\xa0dream for generations of Americans: the election of the country’s first woman president.”That would have been the nut graf of The New York Times story about Hillary Clinton’s historic victory that would have run under the headline “Madam President” spread across six front-page columns, according to reporter Amy Chozick’s new book, Chasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns, and One Intact Glass Ceiling.Chozick writes that the Clinton campaign, which she covered from the beginning, had reacted furiously to the prospect of a Joe Biden run, as floated first in an August 2015 Maureen Dowd Times column and then in a reported story by Chozick. In the book, she writes that “Biden had confided (off the record) to the White House press corps that he wanted to run, but he added something like ‘You guys don’t understand these people. The Clintons will try to destroy me.’”Throughout the book, Chozick refers to her fellow journalists in the small pool that flew on the campaign plane as “Travelers,” while referring to many Clinton staffers collectively as “The Guys.”Asked to comment on the book, a former campaign staffer who’s referred to in it as one of “The Guys” told The Daily Beast: “The challenge on the campaign was that you had a reporter holding the Clintons to a higher standard through a lower standard of reporting. Amy was not always an honest broker, and this book seems to be more of the same. It ridicules people with a smile, contributing little to the public discourse.”From early on, the Clinton camp saw Trump as an enemy to encourage, Chozick writes. During the campaign, as had been previously reported, there was an effort to elevate Trump into a so-called Pied Piper in order to tie him to the mainstream of the Republican Party. “An agenda for an upcoming campaign meeting sent by [Campaign Manager] Robby Mook’s office asked, ‘How do we maximize Trump?’” Chozick writes, describing a time when the GOP primary was still crowded. Even as Trump surged in the polls, the Clinton camp still saw him as a danger to stronger candidates rather than such a candidate in his own right, Chozick reports, so that in August 2015, “when the main GOP debate came on, everyone pushed their pizza crust aside and stared transfixed at the TV set… [Campaign Manager] Robby [Mook] salivated when the debate came back on and Trump started to speak. ‘Shhhhh,’ Robby said, practically pressing his nose up to the TV. ‘I’ve gahtz to get me some Trump.’ Robby thought Rubio would be the nominee. Podesta was bullish on Kasich. Bill and Hillary, still stuck in the 1990s, feared the Bush surname most of all.”By the time of the conventions, though, as Trump was selected as the Republican nominee, the Clinton campaign was still trying to figure out how to improve her negative favorability ratings. “A week earlier, she’d cut off Joel and the pollster John Anzalone, as they walked her through the almost daily reminder that half the country disliked her,” Chozick writes. “You know, I am getting pretty tired of hearing about how nobody likes me,” she said. “‘Oh, what’s the point?

The answer was always the same: nothing. Podesta would explain ‘I remember no one trusted Bill Clinton and he won twice.’”All that seems to lead into the damaging video of Clinton calling half of Trump supporters a “basket of deplorables,” at a New York fundraiser in September 2016. That was no slip of the tongue, since “Hillary always broke down Trump supporters into three baskets,” Chozick writes. “Basket #1: The Republicans who hated her and would vote Republican no matter who the nominee. Basket #2: Voters whose jobs and livelihoods had disappeared, or as Hillary said, ‘who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens in their lives and their futures.’Basket #3: The Deplorables. This basket includes ‘the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic—you name it.’“The Deplorables always got a laugh, over living-room chats in the Hamptons, at dinner parties under the stars on Martha’s Vineyard, over passed hors d’oeuvres in Beverly Hills, and during sunset cocktails in Silicon Valley,” Chozick continues. “‘I really messed up,’ [Clinton] told aides that night,” Chozick writes of the evening when the candidate’s Deplorables shtick went public.On the night of the election, Chozick describes a dejected Clinton when she was told by campaign staffers that it was over. “Of all the Brooklyn aides, Jen Palmieri had the most pleasant bedside manner,” Chozick writes. “That made her the designated deliverer of bad news to Hillary. But not this time. She told Robby there was no way she was going to tell Hillary she couldn’t win. That’s when Robby, drained and deflated, watching the results with his team in a room down the hall from Hillary’s suite, labored into the hallway of the Peninsula to break the news. Hillary didn’t seem all that surprised. ‘I knew it. I knew this would happen to me….’ Hillary said, now within a couple of inches of his face. ‘They were never going to let me be president.’”When all was said and done, according to Chozick’s book, the somewhat acrimonious relationship between the Clinton campaign and The New York Times continued, even after the campaign ended: “After the election, Bill would spread a more absurd Times conspiracy: The publisher had struck a deal with Trump that we’d destroy Hillary on her emails to help him get elected, if he kept driving traffic and boosting the company’s stock price.”"},
 {'title': 'We’ve Fought the NRA for Decades—We’ve Never Seen It as Panicked as It Is Now',

  'body': "In the immediate aftermath of the Parkland shooting, we drew on our combined 50 years of experience battling the National Rifle Association to predict that nothing would change on guns. Those same 50 years of experience now tell us we were wrong. Why? Because we have never seen the NRA more vulnerable.The NRA derives its power on one thing and one thing only: their ability to determine outcomes at the ballot box. In 1993, it knocked off Democratic Governor Jim Florio after he banned assault weapons in gun control-friendly New Jersey—a warning shot to blue state Democrats that even they could be beaten. In 1994, the group beat boll weevil House Democrats like Jack Brooks for supporting a crime bill that included gun restrictions, sending the message that even 30 years of pro-NRA votes didn’t mean jack if you crossed the gun lobby. Heck, even Bernie Sanders owes his first election for Congress to the NRA who called him the “more honorable choice for Vermont” when Republican incumbent Pete Smith bucked them. A Socialist is better than a Republican who messes with us, the group said. \xa0\xa0This electoral lock now looks to be in jeopardy. The leadership at the NRA and the right wing are in a dither because Parkland teens have exposed that the NRA has a 20th century battle plan for a 21st century fight. Thanks to Parkland teenagers, everyone can see that the NRA made the wrong bets on geography; that it’s been complacent on technology; and that it may have lost an entire generation of future voters and office-holders. This explains why the NRA, which has never been particularly modulated in its rhetoric, and many of its conservative media defenders, look especially unhinged today—from insisting that these teenage kids learn CPR instead of push for gun control, to mocking their college rejection letters, to comparing them to Nazis. Losing breeds panic. And for the first time in a long time, the NRA is actually losing. On geography, the NRA has always banked on winning solid rural support, breaking even in suburbia, while withstanding drubbings in urban America. The support is still there, but rural America is shrinking, with 1,351 rural counties having seen a population decrease since 2010. \xa0With mass shootings claiming suburban victims, the NRA could have solidified its appeal by moderating on a handful of commonsense measures that even most of their members would support. Instead they stiffened their stance, worried about being outflanked by the even more extreme gun rights movement on the furthest right. It was the wrong choice. Congressional districts will only become less rural when 2022 maps are drawn with the new census. Suburbanites who often have firearms in the home and who the NRA could count on to not really care that much about the gun issue, instead have flocked to rallies. Their geography is shrinking. \xa0\xa0On technology, here’s one of the NRA’s many dirty little secrets. Among the five million members they claim to have, only an estimated 650,000 are politically active. That’s the number of dues-paying NRA members who subscribe to their activist magazine America’s First Freedom, and—not coincidentally—their number of Twitter followers. The NRA’s trick is to make those activists feel like five million when they flood officeholders with calls and threats. The NRA probably thought 650,000 followers was a good army to amass over nine years on Twitter. Then Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez took seven weeks to attract her 1.5 million followers. Each of her followers—as well as fellow survivor David Hogg’s 700,000—are putting pressure on officeholders every bit as effectively as the NRA did in the past. And this led to their third miscalculation. They panicked after Parkland, and in so doing may have lost an entire generation of young people.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Before Parkland, the gun movement—on the right and on the left—was mostly middle-aged or older. When the NRA and their supporters belittled Parkland survivors with insults, conspiracy theories and threats, they unwittingly ignited an entire generation. There are 15 million kids in high school alone. For millions of them, their activism on this issue will stay with them forever. \xa0\xa0Even before Parkland, cracks were starting to show in the NRA fortress. Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey won re-election to the Senate in 2016 because of, not in spite of, his authorship of a universal background check bill. NRA-backed Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte stuck with the NRA and lost to Democrat Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire with guns a major issue. And in the wake of Parkland, Florida Governor Rick Scott’s support of modest gun restrictions will more likely help, not hurt him in his anticipated Senate run against Democrat Bill Nelson as rural areas shrink. When Republican officeholders in places like Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio and Indiana come to realize that an A-rating from the NRA is a liability, not an asset, the NRA’s Maginot line will break. The NRA has faced difficult times before, but from our vantage point this is the most vulnerable they’ve been in our professional lifetimes. That’s why they are flipping out.Jon Cowan is President and Jim Kessler, @thirdwaykessler, is Senior Vice President for Policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Special counsel Robert Mueller may be pulling on another thread in relation to foreign influence on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. According to The Wall Street Journal, his team of investigators have obtained a nine-slide presentation created by the Israeli firm, Psy-Group, which claims to have links to Israeli intelligence agencies. It is unclear, according to the Journal’s reporting, who received the presentation and whether it is based on analysis of specific activity during the campaign or more of a hypothetical pitch. Mueller is also reportedly examining Psy-Group’s founder Joel Zamel, who is believed to have attended a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in the weeks prior to election day. The documents, also obtained by the Journal, include details about creating fake social media accounts and fake news sites. In one of the slides, entitled “Trump Campaign Components,” there is a 2016 timeline and references to establishing “fake news sites/avatars/content” in the first few months of the year. Through May and July on the timeline, the document suggests that this would be “discrediting news/spreading uncertainty & fake content” by the summer. The final part, leading up to election day, entailed “using fake bots to react to real life situations & further polarize the TA” (target audience). Another slide, called “Fake News Sites Facebook Strategy,” purports that there were “over 140 pro-Trump websites owned by the same man in Veles, Macedonia.” The slide also says that Facebook avatars would be “spreading this news.” In an additional slide, “Facebook Strategy,” there are three steps outlined. The first is “Avatar seeding in relevant groups,” the second is “Real people sharing/engaging” and the final one is a “Multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies.” There is a screenshot underneath of a Facebook account writing “#crooked_hillary would totally destroy Middle East further.” The Daily Beast has reported extensive use of Facebook from Russian accounts to incite voters to attend political events throughout the campaign. Additionally, Mueller previously indicted the Internet Research Agency, a massive troll farm backed by the Kremlin. '},
 {'title': 'The Tiff Over Samantha Bee Has Made C*nts of Us All',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "I love the word “cunt.” It’s so direct, sharp, and mean, with an acrid finish like a lick of whisky that leaves the roof of one’s mouth feeling disinfected and the eyes watering. In my mind, I use “cunt” on everything—men, women, pets, modes of transportation, inanimate objects. The other day I called the toilet paper holder in my bathroom a “stupid little cunt” for failing to hold up the toilet paper. I wish it were more socially acceptable to use it in more contexts. Everything can be a cunt if you truly believe in it. \xa0But until we live in my dream world where everything disappointing can also be a cunt—when a gendered insult can be decoupled from its misogynist baggage—it’s almost never worth it to say it aloud. It’s even less worth it to aim it at a woman. And, generally, the more people who can hear it, the less worth it is to say at all.On Wednesday, Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” on her TBS show Full Frontal. There was an uproar. Bee apologized to Ivanka and to her viewers. The uproar continued. The network apologized. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who works for a man who has allegedly called women who aren’t his daughter cunts multiple times, called for Sam Bee’s show to be canceled. The uproar roared on. Some people pointed out that Donald Trump is fine hanging out with men who call other women cunts. Uproar! In the meantime, nobody’s talking about the reason that Samantha Bee was incensed. Bee isn’t new to this. She should have known that “cunt” is a political comedy A-bomb, that performative pearl-clutching over the word would eclipse the larger point she was trying to make. Which is a shame, because she was making a worthwhile point. Samantha Bee’s comment came during a segment on immigration. The Trump administration’s policy has been to separate parents from children at the border as a deterrent to other would-be immigrants coming to the U.S. Trump isn’t the first president to crack down on immigration. The Obama administration deported more people than any previous administration. But Trump’s approach is far more aggressive and, overtly, inhumane.From every angle—Jeff Sessions’ barely contained glee over Getting Tough with Immigrants to President Trump’s lies about who originated the policy to separate families—the Trump administration’s approach is stupid and cruel. Right as news of the family separation policy was gathering viral heat, Ivanka posted a photo of her cuddling one of her children to social media, a move that made the first daughter look either tone-deaf or cruel. This is why Samantha Bee used the phrase “feckless cunt.” And compared to what preceded and followed, it’s a minor fucking deal.The American government’s systematic dehumanization of immigrants is leagues more offensive than a bleeped insult during a comedy routine. And the White House calling for a show to be canceled—demanding censorship—is much more offensive than a clumsily deployed bad word aimed at a crappy presidential adviser.Rampant corruption and unchecked grift from the White House is more offensive than “cunt.” A careless dismantling of institutions that keep the government functional is also worse than “cunt.” But Bee should have known better. Everybody who can’t resist the cheap shot should know better. When Jimmy Kimmel took a (cheap) shot at Melania Trump’s accent and made a mildly homophobic joke about Sean Hannity’s relationship with Donald Trump, Hannity was able to swoop in and play moral. Kimmel apologized, and the salient point that Kimmel was originally trying to make about Hannity—that he was so deferential to President Trump that he functioned like a media organ of the executive branch—was lost. My father used to do this infuriating thing when he was arguing with a teenaged me. As I would raise my voice, he would lower his, to the point that I was nearly screaming and he was whispering and I always ended up feeling like a real dummy. No matter who had the better points, the more sound logic, he’d always win at a lower volume. In arguments, he explained once, whoever yells first loses. Lose control, lose the argument. Yes, the Hannitys and Huckabees of the world don’t actually care about misogyny. If they did, they wouldn’t carry water for Trump, a man whose brand is misogyny. They don’t care about decorum. If they did, they’d lament the coarsening of American discourse, they’d decry the normalization of Trumpian coarseness. Trump supporters who are silent on any given day of this administration but who demand an apology from Samantha Bee are insincere pricks. But giving them space to legitimately complain about something as beside-the-point as the word “cunt” gives them more breathing room for their bullshit. And, in the end, this is about exposing bullshit, not inviting it.

But is momentary catharsis worth firing up the pearl-clutching outrage machine over? Is it a good thing that we’re exchanging glove slaps over politeness and decorum and hurt feelings when the U.S. government is imposing its cruel will on the lives of other human beings? Of course it’s not. The kerfuffle over Sam Bee’s use of “cunt” is making cunts of us all. "},
 {'title': 'Kenneth Starr Was a Witch Hunter. Robert Mueller Is a Prosecutor.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Each time a shoe drops in the Trump investigation, this time the news about Michael Cohen’s slush fund that had people paying him $1.2 million even after they determined he couldn’t do anything for them, the Trumpy snowflakes start in. Wah wah wah. Stop the investigation. Robert Mueller is another Ken Starr! It’s the most biased investigation in the history of known civilization! If Mueller doesn’t have anything, it’s time to shut it down!It’s all ridiculous, and worse—it is designed to discredit the investigation and prop up Donald Trump, and it will have the effect, if successful, of destroying what’s left of our democratic institutions and processes, leaving them only as things to stripped bare and used for maintaining political power. Let’s go down the list of differences.For starters, Mueller, unlike Starr, is a member of the president’s own party. If judges had tried to appoint a Democratic independent counsel to investigate Bill Clinton, can you imagine the conservative howling? It would never even have happened. The right would have demanded that person’s immediate resignation. And The New York Times and The Washington Post would have said, well, hmmm, they have a point.Which brings us to another key difference, the manner in which both men were appointed. Mueller was appointed by a member of the president’s own party, Rod Rosenstein. Starr was appointed by a three-judge panel of the circuit court for the District of Columbia, two of whose members were well-known activist conservatives. One of them had called liberals “leftist heretics” (Heretics! From what?!) in a journal article. And yet, he was permitted to take part in firing the previous special counsel, a reasonable man—but let the record note, yet another Republican—and replace him with Starr. Again, reverse it, and imagine that in 1994 that three-judge panel had been dominated by two liberals, one of whom had called conservatives “reactionary heretics,” and they appointed a Democrat. Or imagine that Barack Obama had needed to be investigated by a special counsel, and a Democratic deputy to Eric Holder appointed a Democrat. Again, the right-wing outrage machine would never have allowed it to happen. Democrats would never have dared to even try something like this anyway. Yet Mueller’s appointment was greeted with universal approval from elected Democrats.There is just no comparison between the two men—and all that’s not to mention how Starr went on to disgrace himself in other fields, ruining not only his reputation but that of an entire university—or the way they came to their jobs.Or the way they did their jobs, which brings us to the shut-it-down question. Mueller was appointed just under a year ago (next week brings the one-year mark, which will bring another round of cable-news segments asking whether this has gone on too long). Starr was appointed in August 1994. Do you remember when he dropped his famous report on Congress’ doorstep? September—of 1998. Four years later.When Starr was at the same point Mueller is now, a year in, I sure don’t remember any conservatives agreeing that he had gone on too long. Indeed, all they did for the next three years was egg him on. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page was cooking up crackpot conspiracy theories by the week about the circumstances of Vince Foster’s “murder.” William Safire was doing the same with his little acre on the Times op-ed page, predicting Hillary Clinton’s imminent indictment.And Starr pushed forward, provoked by these propagandists. In fact, it was two years in, in August 1996, that Starr lost a big case in Arkansas against two state bankers and Clinton supporters he was hoping to convict and flip. The next month, having failed catastrophically on this case, Starr sent Susan McDougal to jail, trying to force her to spill the beans on Clinton, which a) she refused to do and b) she had no beans to spill anyway since Clinton did nothing wrong. Then, in February 1997, Starr basically admitted he had nothing and announced he was quitting and going to be dean of Pepperdine Law. And did conservatives accept this outcome? Never! Safire, the Journal, and others browbeat him into reneging on the announcement and staying in the job. He still kept turning up nothing until 11 months later, when Kellyanne Conway’s future husband told Starr’s investigators about this woman named Monica.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In other words, Starr ran a four-year campaign—and yes, that one was indeed a witch hunt—during which no one found any credible evidence that Bill Clinton did any of the many nefarious things the right wing accused him of. Yes, he lied under oath. But he did not suborn perjury. They just made that up. Now, with Donald Trump, we have a man whom we have every reason to believe has spent the last 40 years running a business that’s been one or two steps short of a criminal enterprise. Who may very well be compromised and susceptible to blackmail by a foreign power. And we’re not supposed to investigate that?Finally, these attacks on the probe’s integrity. No investigation run by human beings is perfect, and Mueller has surely made some mistakes. But some of these criticisms are horribly dishonest. I was surprised to see Mark Penn, Bill Clinton’s pollster, join this parade last week with a column listing some questions for Mueller. I don’t have space for all of them, but here’s one: “When you picked your team, what was going through your mind when you picked zero donors to the Trump campaign and hired many Democratic donors, supporters of the defiant actions of\xa0Sally Yates, who at the time was deputy attorney general, and prosecutors who had been overturned for misconduct?” We hear this question all the time.I can’t speak for Mueller, but I bet I know precisely what was going through his mind: It’s unethical and illegal to in the Justice Department ask lawyers questions about their political leanings. I would guess that most of Mueller’s lawyers are in fact Democrats, because guess what? Most lawyers are Democrats! And I’d reckon that most of his investigators are Republicans, because guess what? Right. Now you’re catching on. And I note by the bye that Mueller’s spokesman, Peter Carr, whose name you don’t know because he never says anything but “no comment,” used to work in a Senate office. Kamala Harris’? Bernie Sanders’? Nope. Orrin Hatch’s. This, somehow, is almost never mentioned in the press.The Mueller team consists of members of both parties who are trained to be above politics and who strive to maintain that. This is of course unimaginable to people for whom everything is about political power—they can’t believe everyone doesn’t operate from the same base motives they do. But some people actually do. And they’re doing an important job. We have credible reason to suspect that the president of the United States and/or his people and immediate family members colluded with Russia during the election campaign; laundered money to hide the president’s liaison with an adult-film star and possibly other women (and God bless Stormy Daniels; it’s so fitting, isn’t it, that the Patrick Henry of the Trump era would turn out to be a porn star); owes millions or billions of dollars to Russian oligarchs, who thus to some degree own him (as may the Kremlin itself); and has lied and obstructed justice to hide all these things from the American people. There is ample evidence to suggest that all these matters warrant a thorough look. They’re a lot more important than lying about sex. If you want to believe this is a witch hunt, well, I’m here to tell you that sometimes, there are witches."},

  'body': "Did anyone ever doubt for a second before his ghastly Monday morning tweet that Donald Trump would pardon himself? Of course he would. He will do anything he can get away with. Anyone who doesn’t by now acknowledge that is being intentionally stupid.His lawyers have conveniently affirmed for us that he’ll do anything he can get away with. They say he could murder someone. They say that by definition he can’t break the law—any law. Rudy Giuliani says Trump shouldn’t testify because he might perjure himself; on the one hand, that’s a normal thing for a defense lawyer to say, but on the other, it’s a total through-the-looking-glass moment, because the presumption behind Giuliani’s statement, a presumption we have all tragically come to accept as a given, is that there’s simply no chance that the president of the United States can sit there for one afternoon and not tell a pack of lies.We are in a crisis, and it’s a crisis of certainty, because we know that the showdown is inevitable. With another president and another lawyer and another political party, we could hope that some combination of the law and respect for constitutional norms would bring them to heel. But with Trump and Giuliani and this Republican Party, we have every reason to think the showdown is unavoidable.We know that at some point in the future, perhaps next year, we will need Republicans in Congress to step up and say “enough.” It’s a terrifying thought. We’ve been asking this question for 15 months, but we have to keep asking it: What will it take for the Republicans to say he’s gone too far? Maybe a self-pardon. But who knows? The only little flash of backbone they’ve shown has been in saying (mostly in private) that if Trump fired Jeff Sessions, they wouldn’t appoint a replacement. But is that partly just because Sessions is their old colleague? And anyway, Trump could fire Sessions during a Senate recess and then name a recess appointment.And ultimately, of course, the question of limits on presidential power will likely be decided by the courts. By “the courts,” I mean two: The D.C. Court of Appeals, the most important federal circuit court in the country, and of course the Supreme Court.Let’s start with the DC Circuit Court. And this is delicious. Bear with me.Back in 1974, Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski issued a subpoena ordering Richard Nixon to turn over some papers and tapes relevant to the investigation. Nixon turned over some material, but not all, hoping that would satisfy Jaworski. It did not. Nixon’s lawyer, James St. Clair, went to the DC Circuit, and specifically to Chief Judge John J. Sirica, who became a household name in that year of 1974, to quash the subpoena. Sirica refused.We can easily imagine something similar happening in the future. In which case the question becomes relevant. Who is the current chief judge of the DC Circuit?Answer: Merrick Garland.Watch out, Republicans. You may wish you’d have let him get to the Supreme Court after all.Then, assuming (one hopes) that the DC Circuit does not buy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow’s arguments, up the case will go to the Supreme Court, as indeed United States v. Nixon did in 1974. The court, as you may know, ruled unanimously 8-0 (William Rehnquist, who had worked in the Nixon administration, recused himself) against the president. The court held that presidential privilege did not supersede the law. Nixon turned over the tapes and resigned.Would today’s Supreme Court rule similarly? We must start thinking about this now. Most observers seem quite confident that the court would never hold that the president is above the law. Joe Scarborough said on Morning Joe on Monday that “the Supreme Court would never follow the president down this rabbit hole.” Former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman, writing on The New York Times op-ed page Monday, wrote that the Trump legal argument is “almost certain to be sharply rejected should it ever be proffered in court.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Well... I hope they’re right. I think they’re right. Giuliani and Sekulow are arguing explicitly that the president stands above the law. It’s impossible to imagine five justices of the Supreme Court endorsing that view. If a court majority takes that view, the Constitution is worthless, and we are finished as a republic.So no, I don’t think that would happen. But here’s the thing. A 6-3 decision against Trump is a plausible scenario, with Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch backing full executive power. But even a 6-3 decision would be an utter disgrace. It would be sickening to discover that three associate justices of the United States Supreme Court endorse the idea that if the president does it, it can’t be illegal, and would set a terrifying precedent: Two more Gorsuches named to the court, and boom, we’re done.St. Clair, Nixon’s lawyer, once said: “The president wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.”A critical mass of Republicans and a unanimous front of high court justices rejected that view 44 years ago. I wish we could be more confident that they would do the same today."},
 {'title': 'Illiberalism Is Rising. Here’s How We Can Turn That Tide and Renew Our Democracy.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "“I didn’t leave the Democratic Party,” Ronald Reagan famously quipped. “The Democratic Party left me.” At a moment when our main political parties are looking unrecognizable, large numbers of Americans are feeling politically homeless. Even the Gipper would likely be thrown out of today’s Republican Party as an apostate. Reagan was, after all, the president who called for an amnesty for illegal immigrants, believed in American leadership underpinned by a human-rights agenda, personally denounced bigotry, and launched the process that led to the formation of the World Trade Organization. Today’s Republicans would in all likelihood call him out as a RINO—Republican in Name Only—and shame him on social media.We have arrived at a point where the old political and policy divisions between left and right are less important than the divide between the liberal (in the term’s original Enlightenment sense) and the illiberal. The liberal believes in individual rights and tolerance, international engagement and the rule of law while the illiberal believes in nativism, populism, protectionism and isolationism. For the moment, momentum seems to be with forces arrayed with the illiberals, and against liberty. This must be taken as an alarm bell, a clarion call to action. We are at a frightening moment. A Washington Post survey just prior to the 2016 election found that 46 percent of Americans reported that they have lost faith in democracy—or never had it to begin with. A Harvard study found one in six are ready for a military dictatorship, up from one in sixteen twenty years ago. Thirty-one percent of Americans (including 51 percent of Republicans) believe the press is “an enemy of the people.” One in four Americans believe that the government should be able to prevent publication of information that officials deem biased or inaccurate.It’s worse among young people, a dangerous harbinger. Only thirty percent of millennials think it is essential to live in a democracy, compared to almost seventy-five percent of those born before World War II. Millennials also show a low tolerance for free and open debate: according to a Pew Research Poll in 2015, forty percent (versus twenty-seveneight percent of Gen-Xers) think the government should be able to ban potentially offensive speech. The news from abroad is just as bad. For 12 straight years, Freedom House has judged the world less free than the year prior. Authoritarian regimes are not only ascendant throughout the world—they are actively supported by many who value efficiency over liberty or whose cynicism fuels a pretense that no fundamental difference exists between free and unfree societies. The recent Italian election showed more than half the population voting for extremist or anti-European parties. Germany has seen the return of a far right party to the Bundestag. In countries like Poland and Hungary openly illiberal governments are in power. An avowed Marxist and terrorist apologist leads one of the United Kingdom’s two main parties. Even in France, where the recent election of Emmanuel Macron suggested a possible return to the democratic order of old, extreme right and extreme left candidates received together almost forty percent of the vote and polls show a similar number would support an “authoritarian government” unhindered by checks and balances.It is critical for defenders of liberal democracy—no matter their personal political views—to unite and fight back against this rising tide. This is the mission of the Renew Democracy Initiative, a new organization dedicated to bringing together concerned citizens of all political views in the support of shared basic ideals. In the wake of the 2016 election, a number of us met to see what could be done to halt the march of illiberalism that the prior year had brought so painfully into focus. Because ideas must stand at the forefront of any political movement, we drafted a manifesto of those first principles indispensable to liberal democracy.Signatories are those devoted to fundamental individual rights like freedom of speech, of religion, of assembly, to checks and balances in government, and to the integrity of our institutions and civil society. We believe in the importance of free trade and of rational immigration policy in powering prosperity, of free markets and individual choice, and of the post-war international system where national disputes can be settled by law and countries can together address global issues. And our group seeks to rally those who demand a civil, effective government, where moderates of the left and right can come together to solve problems and respond to the needs of their citizens.Our organization embraces people of good will on all sides of the political spectrum who value the liberal democratic order. Over 120 prominent thinkers and leaders have signed the manifesto, including former heads of state, Nobel laureates, writers, business leaders, diplomats, academics, artists, and a certain chess player, our co-founder and Chairman Garry Kasparov. We aim to bring together the centrist majority to fix our government and repair our political dialogue by proving once more what history has shown again and again: that the best system for human governance is liberal democracy.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely,” cautioned Franklin Roosevelt. “The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.” Education is at the heart of our project. Proponents of the democratic idea must do better articulating the importance and necessity of this idea for contemporary audiences. We must demonstrate that the principles animating it are alive, powerful, and critical to preserving and bettering the lives of all citizens. We aim to take up that challenge by convening meetings, engaging on campus, publishing books and articles, providing a platform for moderate voices and leaders, and generally explaining and defending the principles we all believe in. “Democracy never lasts long,” John Adams warned two centuries ago. “It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.” Alarming words at a moment when some Americans themselves are leading the call to dismantle the institutions that have preserved our Republic. The Founding Fathers created a unique and uniquely effective system, codified in the Constitution, to address the problems representative democracies face. It is hard to overstate the value of this system and of its international corollary: the American-led post-war liberal democratic order of international institutions and treaties, the rule of law, and the respect for human rights as a universal good. We have weathered the tragedy of slavery, a Civil War, two World Wars, the Great Depression, and the Cold War—and remained strong. Despite the headlines and crises, never have so many in the world enjoyed such prosperity and peace. Ronald Reagan may have had John Adams in mind when he declared that “freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.” Let us ensure we are not that generation."},
 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump: This Will End Badly. And Probably Soon.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Like a bloated, portly fake billionaire rolling off a hooker after a hot 45 seconds of passionate sex, Donald Trump’s ardor for Rudy Giuliani seems to have cooled. If the White House leaks are any barometer, it sounds more and more as if Donald wants Rudy to get his money off the nightstand and the hell out of his room at the No-Tell-Motel. This is what happens when you work for Trump, and Rudy is old enough, crafty enough, and knows Trump well enough to have known better. Trump’s hiring of my old boss is a triumph of today’s Trump-right media bubble, where nothing matters but the coverage on Fox & Friends, Hannity, Sinclair stations’ nightly Two Minutes of Hate, and on the nut-site constellation that comprises conservative “news” sites. Trump didn’t hire Rudy for his skills as a litigator, or as a warrior in the high-speed low-drag social-media world of today. He was hired to break shit and make loud noises, and he’s damn good at it. Unfortunately for Rudy, that probably won’t be enough to save him from the Trump curse. Trump has been mostly unable to hire and retain top-flight litigators because he destroys everyone around him. His record of stacking former staffers like cordwood as they are either fired, humiliated, shamed, permanently scarred, forced to cut off a finger by the Yakuza, morally compromised, or moved into the Witness Protection Program will go down in presidential history. It’s no secret that he’s a spectacular liar at all times and on all subjects, leaving his legal team constantly wary they have a client who combines a stubborn streak and a self-destructive nature with an endless capacity to lie to them about his marital, financial, and political lies. However, like so many others who should know better, Rudy staked his legacy on one last waltz with Trump, and may soon learn why no one else wanted the job. Trump follows a clear pattern with his employees, hangers-on, camp followers, and six-degrees-of-separation edge cases who trail him like chunks of matter kicked off some fecal comet hurling across the political firmament. The pattern is abundantly evident at this point, and it’s one Rudy should realize applies to everyone in Trump’s sphere of crapulous influence. “By now you should know that 70 percent of the time when ‘sources close to the President’ bitchslap you to the press, you can just strike the words, ‘sources close to’ from the sentence.”Here’s a preview, mayor, of how this is going to go in the coming weeks:You’re already out of the honeymoon phase, but I’m sure it was nice while it lasted. It always happens with Trump appointees: He praises you in his intense, hyperbolic way. Even if you’re a wily, hardened person, those blandishments tend to make his appointees drop their panties faster than a high-school cheerleader in the back of the quarterback’s van for a simple reason: The praise isn’t just from the president. Sure, it’s nice when the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. sings your virtues, but the amplification mechanism of Fox News, Infowars, Breitbart, and others are so passionate and so fulsome that you really want to hoover up another rail of that ego powder. Then come the Trumpsplaining pieces in the gentry conservative outlets praising you as the One Who Got Trump Right and Is Turning Everything Around.Then come the leaks. This White House has a singular leaker at the very top, and by now you should know that 70 percent of the time when “sources close to the president” bitchslap you to the press, you can just strike the words “sources close to” from the sentence. Trump is like some veldt animal at the edge of a muddy river, continually sniffing the wind for a scent; all he cares about is how the coverage reflects on him, so if he perceives an even slightly negative tone, the people sacrificing their reputations for him go under the bus. Add to that the crew of Jared and Ivanka, hard at work with their Lil Machiavels playset. They hate you because haters hate. Duh. Throw in Hapless Leaker, and dead-man-walking John Kelly, Kellyanne von Munchausen, and the shitbird chorus on the outside of Trump’s political family and no one gets out of here alive. To save yourself, you’ll make the mistake of trying to give him advice. Sensible, correct, legitimate advice. That’s the worst thing you can do because Trump parses counsel as critique and guidance as discipline. At that point, you’re dead, even if you’re too stubborn to lay down and start stinking up the place.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.You’ll keep swinging, struggling, trying to gain purchase in a wilderness of tweets and confusing signals, but once Trump is bored and restless enough, the “we’re about to fire him” rumor machine gets spun up. At that point, it’s only a matter of time before Donald’s itchy Twitter finger gets the best of him and he fires you.I went to work for Rudy in 1997 during his re-election campaign for mayor, along with my business partner at the time, Adam Goodman. We were the upstart Florida guys who somehow scored the work of the mayor who was then becoming known as the man who turned New York around. I formed some of the closest and most enduring friendships of my life on that campaign. All legacies are complex, and Rudy’s is certainly not without its faults, mistakes, rough edges, and excesses. In the 20 years that have passed since, I’ve often pondered the inflection points of Rudy’s career. The first was his tenure as mayor. Tireless, restless, aggressive, imperfect, hands-on all the time. Good Rudy loved that job more than life itself. He was built for it, racing to fires, building collapses, jumping out of the Suburban and into every crisis. He was Batman; nocturnal, judgmental, sometimes questionable in his methods, but pursuing an order too lacking in a city that had drifted for too long. When he was Bad Rudy, it was often to fix a worse problem.The second inflection point was 9/11. The 9/11 attacks tested Rudy, broke him, rebuilt him, and changed something deep in his soul. His finest moments came in those dusty, terrifying streets where the death toll was still unknown and unknowable, where fires marked the eternal gap in the city’s skyline and Lower Manhattan was a landscape of ash. He took on the mantle of leadership at a moment of horror, and it is the knowledge of what he did that day that sharpens the painful contrast to the man he now serves.The third point came when he took this job. Trump is a man who offers his employees and supporters little in return for their sacrifice. He will, as he always does, sacrifice even a personality and a legacy as bold as Rudy’s. The doom is already in the air, and the president’s unrivaled appetite for the destruction of all who serve him is growing. As mayor of New York City, Rudy never ducked a fight. As Trump’s attorney, he’s in a fight he can’t win, because his opponent isn’t Robert Mueller, or Michael Avenatti, or Stormy Daniels. His opponent, and the man willing to burn him and his legacy to the ground, is his client, Donald J. Trump."},
 {'title': 'Trump Has a Point About Amazon That Resonates With His Base',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Trump has an ulterior motive for his attacks on Amazon.com, whose owner also owns The Washington Post. But does he also have a point?Yes and no, it seems. Trump has claimed the company pays “little or no taxes to state & local governments.” The truth is that Amazon pays hundreds of millions in taxes. The valid criticism is that, once upon a time, Amazon (which had no physical presence in most states) didn’t collect a sales tax in most states. But today, Amazon collects sales tax in 45 states that have a sales tax, and some experts believe that any additional federal legislation would only help Amazon monopolize, by creating additional hurdles to stifle any potential upstart competitors from emerging. There’s also the aforementioned fact that Jeff Bezos owns both The Washington Post and Amazon.com. There is little reason to believe that the Post is doing Amazon’s bidding against Trump, but it’s hard to deny the perception on the part of some people that it might. The average American—the guy who assumes that everybody is a corrupt swamp creature—assumes Bezos would use the Post do his bidding—even as they accept the fact that Trump uses his perch to punch back. \xa0What about Trump’s claims about the post office? “Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,” the president tweeted on Monday. “THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.” PolitiFact pooh-poohs Trump’s tweet, but it’s not like he made it up or got it from InfoWars.Trump’s take is likely based on a 2017 Wall Street Journal op-ed, which notes that an “analysis from\xa0Citigroup\xa0estimates that if costs were fairly allocated, on average parcels would cost $1.46 more to deliver. It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip—a gift card from Uncle Sam.” How could this be? According the op-ed’s author, money-management executive Josh Sandbulte, “select high-volume shippers are able to drop off presorted packages at the local Postal Service depot for ‘last mile’ delivery at cut-rate prices.”The bottom line seems to be that this might be a sweetheart deal, but Amazon probably isn’t breaking the law. It’s just very good at utilizing current laws, which (let’s be honest) haven’t adapted to the digital age.“Ultimately, the fight against Amazon is part of a much greater struggle in battle between protectionism and innovation.”This is to say I don’t think most of what Trump is specifically alleging holds much water. What I do think deserves our attention (aside from the ethics of using the bully pulpit to intimidate an adversary) is a question that helped Trump win the presidency in the first place: How has modernity harmed middle America?And here, I think Trump’s move is pretty consistent with his rhetoric about economic protectionism. If globalism and immigration are serious problems for America’s workforce (as Trump seems to indicate), then automation poses an even bigger problem. “[O]ur fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!" Trump tweeted Monday. Forget the tax part. We are losing mom and pop shops. On this, he has a point. And this realization transcends the left-right paradigm, uniting a coalition of populists, communitarians, and working-class Americans. “What we are seeing all over this country is the decline in retail,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday. “We’re seeing this incredibly large company getting involved in almost every area of commerce. And I think it is important to take a look at the power and influence that Amazon has.” Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, a leftish Democrat, has also urged the Trump administration to “rein in” Amazon.Progressives like to frame this as big vs. small, but it could just as easily be defined as virtual vs. local. The truth is that companies like Amazon are destroying some brick and mortar retailers. And even if these job losses are more than made up for by increases in the e-commerce sector, we are still losing something more precious than money. Once upon a time, elites and businesses were tied to a community—and owed that community at least some perfunctory responsibility for its wellbeing. In The Revolt of the Elites, Christopher Lasch recalls a time when “wealth was understood to carry civic obligations.” “There has always been a privileged class, even in America,” he concedes, “but it has never been so dangerously isolated from its surroundings.” When we lament the loss of trust in elites and institutions—and the sense that the working class is being left behind—the loss of local jobs that physically exist in local communities is worth considering.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.To be sure, modern tech companies donate loads of money to good, philanthropic causes, but they do this from Seattle or Silicon Valley, or—even more ethereally—“the cloud.” As Lasch writes, “what mattered [in the old days] was that philanthropy implicated elites in the lives of their neighbors and those of generations to come.” Middle Americans, even if they derive some income from a tech company, owe no such allegiance or reverence to them. It’s just business. Ultimately, the fight against Amazon is part of a much greater struggle in battle between protectionism and innovation. Until recently, conservatives were uniformly in favor of the latter. Rather than buying the argument that the world is static, there was a sense that we could grow the pie. Sure the automobile put the horse and buggy maker out of business, but it ended up creating more—and better—jobs in the process. And let’s be honest, most innovations have made many of us more comfortable and prosperous. I can’t tell you how many affordable household items (never mind books) I purchase on Amazon each year. Yet, today’s Americans are increasingly pessimistic that “creative destruction” will be have a happy ending this time around. What happens when automation and artificial intelligence really kick in? How many of us will even be employable or needed? Never mind money, what about our need for purpose and meaning and community? When drones deliver all our necessities to our front door, we will have even less reason to set aside VI headsets (or sex robots—depending on how things shake out) and venture outside and see our neighbors. Amazon is a part of this story. But I suspect that at least some of the animosity aimed at Facebook (a company that, frankly, has earned some legitimate scorn) is based on this same deep-seated fear. These tech companies have suddenly become less popular with the public, and this is because we have gone from a nation of tech utopians to a nation of tech dystopians. In my mind, questions about anti-trust violations, the post office, and taxation are merely the convenient subplots in a much larger story. If the public ultimately sides with Trump over Amazon—as they might—it’ll have little to do with the details, and everything to do with fear of a dark future. '},
 {'title': 'Republican Senators Need to Be Clear With Trump: Don’t Fire Mueller',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As we stampede into year two of the Robert Mueller investigation, Republicans have done absolutely nothing to prevent President Donald Trump from firing him. Late last month, a bipartisan bill passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would allow a special council to appeal to a panel of judges, in the event that they were fired without “good cause.” But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell won’t bring it up for a vote, and even if he did (and it were to miraculously pass the House and Senate), the president wouldn’t sign it—which means it would have to pass with a veto-proof majority—which, of course, isn’t going to happen. The whole caper reminds me of the almost-impossible setup to the Ocean’s Eleven heist: “Say we get into the cage, and through the security doors there and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with the guns, and into the vault we can't open...we're just supposed to walk out of there with $150,000,000 in cash on us, without getting stopped?” Sadly, there are no Danny Ocean’s in the U.S. Senate to pull this one off. At the risk of getting too deep in the legislative and constitutional weeds about a bill no one thinks has a chance, it’s probably worth considering how our elected representatives can make it less likely that the president will fire Robert Mueller. Maybe just bringing up this bill will serve as a symbolic warning sign to the president? Even here, this is risky business. Some Republican senators have received personal assurances from the president that he won’t fire Mueller. They are content to take him at his word—and this is arguably a legitimate strategic decision. They're comfortable with launching investigations of the Mueller investigation even when—as revealed by the White House on Tuesday—those investigations don't involve congressional Democrats, as will be the case with a briefing with the Intel leaders on the informant the FBI used to keep tabs on the Trump campaign. There are other problems. Senator Ben Sasse, one of the more heroic conservatives when it comes to standing up to President Trump, opposes the bill on constitutional grounds. “Firing Robert Mueller while Russia is waging a shadow war against America would be disastrous for the nation, not to mention politically suicidal for the president,” Sasse recently said. \xa0“But we can’t solve a crisis of public trust by creating a constitutional crisis with a new fourth branch of government,” Sasse said in a statement provided to The Weekly Standard. “And unfortunately, that’s the road this bill takes.”As best I can tell, what Sasse means by creating a “fourth branch” of government is that this bipartisan bill doesn’t fit neatly inside any of the three branches of government. It uses Congress and the courts to usurp executive branch responsibilities in a way where responsibility belongs to neither wholly legislative, nor wholly judicial, nor wholly executive actors.In an attempt to fix this, there were thoughts of adding amendments. Sasse contemplated one that would have responded to a potential Mueller firing by simply declaring that “Congress will use its lawful authorities under the Constitution of the United States — A) to ensure that the investigation is completed; and B) to hold the executive branch accountable.” But for various parliamentary reasons, that amendment hasn’t been introduced, and since the bill is considered to be dead, doing so would be a moot point. Still, Sasse hasn’t changed his mind about the sentiment—even as it appears likely this bill will simply wither on the vine. “Senator Sasse has explored multiple options to ensure that, if the President tries to deep-six the Special Counsel, the Russia investigation can be sustained and completed under Congress’ constitutional authority,” said James Wegmann, spokesman for Sasse. “We’ve considered a wide range of options that respect the constitution’s separation of powers–those options include using advice and consent power, funding power, subpoena power, and oversight authority,” he continued. Hmm. Reading between the lines, “advice and consent” power could include creating a complete and total logjam of nominations required to move nominees. “Funding power” notes the ability of Congress to impose budgetary consequences on a White House. And “subpoena” and “oversight” are reminders that Congress has the ability to bring in any number of administration officials to testify before the intel committee. In other words, the co-equal branches of power actually do have some power—if they would actually employ it. All of these mechanisms could be used retroactively—and their potential use could serve as a deterrent against firing Mueller. It turns out there is no realistic statutory way to stop Trump from firing Mueller. The leverage was always to (a) let it be known this was a red line, and (b) use the threat of retaliation as a deterrent. (Sound familiar?)

It is a tenet of conservatism that not every problem has a legislative solution. This problem seems to fit into that category.The legislative part was always going to be symbolic, anyway. The key here is for Republican senators to band together to send a clearer message to Trump that firing Mueller will have serious consequences. And on this count, they have probably not been clear enough. The GOP message now seems to be: “Oh I don’t think Trump would fire Mueller.” It should be more akin to what Sasse seems to be suggesting: “Trump better not fire Mueller—or else!”"},
 {'title': 'How RFK Could Have Become President',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'To see him at the podium claiming victory in the crucial California primary, jokingly thanking his dog Freckles, passionately hopeful that the divided country could come together, flashing a peace sign as he exhorts: ‘So it’s on to Chicago and let’s win there!” Knowing what is to come a moment later, it is hard not to assume that it was only Sirhan Sirhan’s bullets that kept Robert Kennedy out of the White House. The cold political realities of June 1968 were very different. Despite his victory in the winner-take-all California primary—a victory that was well under the 50 percent mark the Kennedy campaign had hoped for—the primary season was ending, as virtually every TV analyst noted, with Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who had entered no primary battle, as the real winner. Big states without primaries, like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, were lined up solidly in his corner, as were the Southern states, as was the leader of the AFL-CIO. And once the New York primary ended two weeks after California, there was no place else to go to win delegates at the ballot box.“We were losing altitude,” de facto campaign manager Fred Dutton reflected later. looking back at the political terrain Kennedy was facing. In fact, the day of the primary, Dutton was skeptical enough of our chances to suggest that RFK would take the vice-presidential slot if offered.“Bobby’s a Roman,” Dutton said. “He’ll go where the power is.” And a delegate analysis showed that Humphrey would end the primary season with close to1,000 of the 1,312 delegates need for nomination; Bobby and Eugene McCarthy together had fewer than 700.So the question that has lingered for half a century—Could RFK have won the White House?—needs an unsentimental look at the prospects, even from someone who worked as a Senate and campaign speechwriter. Some years ago, I devoted 150 pages of an alternate history book to suggest how that might have happened. That scenario included some imagined twists and turns that a strictly “reality-based” view requires reshaping. Here is an unvarnished outline of how he might have won.His Survival Changes the Political Dynamic If Sirhan had carried out the assassination attempt but failed, Bobby would have been an instant icon among Democrats; and there would have been an outpouring of goodwill among the broader electorate. We saw this when President Reagan narrowly escaped death at the hands of John Hinckley in 1981; the relief that a major political figure had not been killed would have been enormous, especially coming only eight weeks after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., and years of escalating national violence. Among Kennedy’s most passionate supporters—blacks and Latinos—the support would, if possible, have grown more intense; and that in turn would have put pressure on big-state party leaders—“bosses”— who had committed to Humphrey.Sen. Eugene McCarthy Leaves the Race In his TV interviews just before heading to the Embassy Ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy had one central message—only a united “peace” campaign could hope to defeat Humphrey.\xa0“I can only win,” he said, “if I have the help and assistance of Senator McCarthy and/or those who support him. Otherwise, the policies about the war and the cities will not change.” RFK had said flatly that if he lost California, he’d exit the race; Senator McCarthy, who had entered the campaign the previous fall after Kennedy declined, had made no such commitment. And the bitterness of McCarthy’s people at Kennedy’s sudden entry into the race was still strong. A few nights before the primary, journalist Jack Newfield and I had gone to the hotel where McCarthy staffers were staying, making the pitch for the California loser to leave the race. One McCarthy aide said, “If we have to have a red-baiting opportunist in the White House, I’d rather have Nixon.”More significantly, though, some of McCarthy’s top lieutenants, including Sam Brown, who had organized the “Clean for Gene” youth invasion of New Hampshire, signaled clearly that they would switch to RFK if he won the California primary. If the anti-war liberals in New York followed suit, it would have meant not only a last big collection of delegates, but a clear field for Kennedy.He Wins the Backing of Chicago Mayor Richard Daley Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Daley’s the ballgame,” Bobby had said when he entered the race. It wasn’t just that Daley controlled the huge Illinois delegation; it was that he would signal to old-line Democrats around the country that he, as shrewd a political judge as any, had concluded that Bobby, not Hubert, was the only way to defeat Nixon in November. According to Thurston Clarke’s book The Last Campaign, Daley had told an RFK ally that “if he wins California, he’ll be okay.” A Daley endorsement would have meant the dramatic resetting of the political terrain.He Runs an ‘Inside-Outside’ Campaign “I’m going to chase Hubert’s ass all across the country,” Bobby told Richard Goodwin just before heading down to claim victory. The campaign’s only hope, riding on the heels of a Daley endorsement, was to demonstrate his rank-and-file support with massive rallies in big cities, and with an intense dive into rural America, where his whistle-stop train trips helped him win surprising backing in the small towns and farm communities of Indiana, Nebraska, and South Dakota (it was also a way of demonstrating that Bobby Kennedy was not simply the candidate of black and brown America). Without primaries to run in, the campaign had to make it clear to the party leaders that Robert Kennedy was their best chance to defeat the man Democrats had cordially despised for two decades.At the same time, Kennedy would make it clear that he was not about to frontally challenge the party machinery or leaders. His schedule had called for him to stop in Missouri on his way back East from California. And the summer would have sent him not just into rallies and public gatherings, but into meetings of convention delegates and party officials. Hyannis, the setting for the Kennedy family compound on Cape Cod, would have seen a procession of party leaders and delegates, for dinners and social events with the family.He ‘Neutralizes’ LBJ and J. Edgar Hoover The decades-long antipathy between RFK and LBJ—"Mutual Contempt,” as one book title aptly put it—meant that Kennedy was battling not just Hubert Humphrey, but a sitting Democratic President who blamed Bobby for his decision to abandon reelection. And in FBI Director Hoover, Bobby had an enemy more than happy to undermine the campaign, and who was possessed of a trove of information, and not just about the reckless sexual compulsions of President John Kennedy. It was no accident that damaging stories about RFK’s wiretapping of Martin Luther King had surfaced just before the Oregon primary—the only one Kennedy lost.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 In my book, I suggested that Hoover’s power might have been neutralized by threats from the Kennedy people to reveal unsavory details about Hoover’s private life, especially his unusually close association with his deputy, Clyde Tolson. (They traveled together, lunched together every day, even had plans to be buried next to each other.) But that is speculation. It’s also possible that Robert Kennedy, as attorney general, head learned the details of LBJ’s financial history; somehow after a lifetime on the government payroll, he’d accumulated a net worth of some $14 million. It’s at least plausible to suggest that a quid pro quo might have convinced both LBJ and RFK to holster their weapons of political destruction, but even after 50 years, the potential of Hoover and LBJ to undermine RFK remains the most intriguing of “what if?” questions.He Challenges the Rules at the Convention and Wins The projections of Kennedy’s delegate hunters assumed he would get no support from the Southern delegations, both because of their antipathy to his civil-rights programs, and because they were solidly in the pocket of Lyndon Johnson. But some of those delegations—Mississippi’s for example—flatly violated an agreement at the 1964 convention that such delegations be racially representative (Mississippi had one black delegate). Kennedy’s strategy would have been to force even Humphrey supporters from places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, to unseat such delegations and replace them with more balanced slates—which would have meant a lot more black delegates, which would almost certainly would have meant more votes for RFK. Further, many of those Southern delegates used the “unit rule,” where all of the state’s votes went to the candidate who had won a majority. Had that rule been successfully challenged, it would have unlocked several dozen more votes for Kennedy. In turn, he would have had to release his California delegates, who’d been chosen in a winner-take-all primary, to vote as they pleased; they would surely have voted for the man on whose slate they had run.He Picks a Credible VeepKennedy had long been haunted by the knowledge that his brother had chosen LBJ as his running mate in 1960. It was politically sound—JFK might not have won Texas and other Southern states without him—but Bobby’s conviction that LBJ was a dangerous, unstable President meant that the choice of a vice-president mattered, even beyond the blunt political calculations.I don’t remember a single conversation among his aides and advisors about the second slot—the campaign was too intense, too frenzied, for that. But it seems reasonable that Bobby would have looked to a “unity” choice by picking a Southerner who had supported Humphrey. The logical candidate would have been Terry Sanford, former Governor of North Carolina. Unlike other possible choices—Tennessee Senator Al Gore Sr.—Sanford had not opposed the landmark civil rights laws of the mid-60’s. A bolder possibility would have been Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough, a liberal populist who had waged civil war with the more conservative Democrats in that state. That choice would have been a political thumb in the eye of the President.A still bolder strategy—one seriously considered by John McCain in 2008—would be to put a liberal Republican on the ticket like California Senator Tom Kuchel, who had just lost a primary to a far-right opponent. But that would likely not have appealed much to a convention looking for party unity.The Nixon Challenge—and the Wallace FactorRichard Nixon’s long climb back from political failure to a second GOP nomination was premised on the idea that he would provide “new leadership” that would restore a sense of order and calm to a divided nation.“Feel Safer With Nixon,” his billboards had proclaimed in the primary season and one of his memos to his staff underline the argument that: “We are the OUTS and they are the INs.” With Robert Kennedy as his opponent, that argument was undermined, since RFK himself was the embodiment of “new leadership.” Instead, Nixon would be running as the champion of middle America, the “forgotten American,” a theme he had been using since his first Congressional campaign back in 1946. Bobby, his argument would go, was feeding the forces of disruption and disorder. He was standing with the flag-burners; he was stirring up massive crowds (of blacks and browns, it did not need to be said), triggering frenzy that even Kennedy’s own campaign thought did not play well on America’s TV screens.To combat Nixon’s strategy required the same kind of “two-step” that Kennedy had deployed in the primaries. He had to engage his base— make sure they registered to vote in numbers they had never done before. It had worked in California; now it had to work in a dozen states or more. (Hs brother had lost California and Ohio in 1960 and barely won New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Illinois). But he also had to find support in rural America, as he’d done in the primaries. This was a hard-nosed political necessity: white America had to see Bobby talking and listening to farmers, small-town merchants, homemakers, in settings right out of Norman Rockwell. But it was also critical to his policy intentions. The Presidency would be worth very little if his ideas about jobs, housing, and poverty were seen simply as race-based. That approach meshed with a second, crucial element in Robert Kennedy’s Presidential effort: He had to win over a substantial share of those tempted to back Alabama Gov. George Wallace, running a third-party campaign.This sounds ludicrous—unless you had gone into the crowds that came to hear RFK in the primaries and heard them tell reporters like NBC ’s Charles Quinn that while they had no truck with civil rights or ant-Vietnam protesters, they somehow saw Kennedy as tough enough, experienced enough to get a handle on what was pulling the country apart. (In real life, a post-campaign analysis showed that a substantial share of Indiana Kennedy voters wound up voting for Wallace in November). And in 1968, Wallace’s totals in New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, and California were far higher than he margins by which Nixon won those states.What About Debates? Unlike this brother, RFK was not a skilled debater; the need to commit short, simplified summaries of his ideas to memory was simply not in his wheelhouse. He’d done well enough in his one primary debate with Eugene McCarthy, but that was a more informal setting than a general election face-off. But the presence of George Wallace as a significant candidate would have altered RFK’s strategy. He would have welcomed the chance to square off with Wallace; to remind working-class whites that Wallace’s Alabama was ground zero for anti-union, low-wage jobs (that fact that would have brought AFL-CIO president George Meany into a reluctant but significant endorsement of RFK). Nixon by contrast, would have wanted a two-person debate, to hammer Bobby as the candidate of disorder. That, in turn, would have given Kennedy the chance to demand fairness for Wallace, to insist that all three candidates appear in a debate. The likelihood would have been no debates at all, which is what in fact happened in 1968.In the End… Any attempt to game out the events of an alternate reality requires a leap into the unknown: Would President Johnson have undermined Kennedy’s peace theme by re-escalating the War in Vietnam? Would Kennedy’s covert allies inside the government have leaked the Nixon campaign’s attempts to sabotage peace negotiations?If we put those speculations aside, we face the probability of a very close election, just as it was in 1960. It’s hard to see RFK wining any Southern state; it’s worth remembering that New England and the Middle Atlantic states were far more competitive back then than they have since become. But if Kennedy was able to rally his natural supporters, and make inroads in rural America, he could have captured many of the states—Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, California—that ultimately fell to Nixon. There’s another, all too possible reset of a Nixon-Wallace-RFK race: if Bobby had won some but not all of those big battlegrounds, the campaign would have ended with no candidate winning 270 electoral votes. That would have thrown the election into the House of Representatives, where each state would cast one vote. A candidate would have need 26 votes to take the White House, and the Southern delegations, dominated by segregationist Democrats, would have held the balance of power. And that would have meant that the central themes of both Nixon and RFK—the desperate need for an end of division and disorder—would have wound up in a genuine Constitutional crisis.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 And even had Robert Kennedy won the White House, that would have been no guarantee that the hopes of him and his supporters would have been realized. His efforts to put power in the hands of local communities would have unsettled many big-city mayors; his call for radical restructuring of schools would have put him crosswise with the teachers’ unions that formed a significant bloc of Democratic Party foot soldiers. If his programs, which would have taken years to begin working, did not quell violence in the inner city, the blame would have been put at the doorstep of RFK’s White House. And if a Vietnam coalition had ended in a Communist victory, his opponents would have assailed him for his naiveté. (One future I am almost certain of is that his 1972 foe would have been California Governor Ronald Reagan).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 None of these speculations and uncertainties about what\xa0might\xa0have been, however, can erase the memory of what\xa0did\xa0happen\xa0that late\xa0June 4th night, when his staff and friends, gathered in the living room of his fifth-floor suite at the Ambassador, watched him joyfully accept victory with the sense that there was at least a possibility, a real possibility, that he might really have a chance. Moments later, the pictures on the screen changed to disjointed images of chaos, and a figure prone on a kitchen floor. I think everyone of us knew, in those first moments, that there would be no chance to make those possibilities real.'},

  'body': 'The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Thursday that it had raised $14.3 million in March—$3.8 million of which came from online contributions, with an average online gift of $17. The DCCC’s record March total outpaced its congressional competitor, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which raised $10.5 million in the same month. By comparison, in March of 2016, a presidential year, the DCCC raised significantly less than they posted for this past month. While the NRCC continues to narrowly lead the DCCC in cash on-hand—with $58.8 million, compared to $57 million—the Democrats’ March haul comes at a moment in which individual Democratic campaigns are also out-raising a host of Republican congressinal incumbents. During the first financial quarter of 2018, there were at least 58 GOP-held seats in which a Democratic challenger raised more than the GOP incumbent holding the seat. Furthermore, the NRCC’s March 2018 total actually represents a decrease from the same monthly haul in 2017, during which the Republican outfit raised more than $15 million. Overall, the NRCC has had a strong first quarter of the year with $31 million raised. But the DCCC has now out-raised the NRCC for consecutive months after January—an additional sign of potential trouble for Republican incumbents hoping to keep the House majority under President Trump.

  'body': 'Rep. Tom Garrett, a first-term Republican who represents Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, announced on Monday that he is an alcoholic and will not be seeking re-election.Garrett, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, made his announcement Monday afternoon, just four days after saying he would run again. The announcement was first reported by The Washington Post.“Any person—Republican, Democrat or independent—who has known me for any period of time and has any integrity knows two things: I am a good man and I’m an alcoholic,” Garrett reportedly said in Richmond. “This is the hardest statement that I have ever publicly made by far. It’s also the truth.”The announcement follows a tumultuous week for Garrett. First, his chief of staff resigned, prompting reports that suggested his term could be his first and last in Congress. That reporting led to Garrett holding a rambling news conference in which he insisted that he would run again in November. Another report from Politico followed, describing a hostile work environment in which staff and interns were allegedly asked to do things like clean up dog poop. “The recent attacks on my family and myself were a series of half truths and full lies,” Garrett said Monday in response to the reports. “I am not dying,” he continued. “I am starting anew with work and dedication. Great things can be done. This isn’t an ending for me or my values of service to my fellow man. It’s just a new beginning.”Garrett is the 44th Republican member of Congress to announce retirement, seeking another office, or resigning this term. '},
 {'title': 'Charlottesville Hate Marcher Elected by Republican Party',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "An affiliate of a “pro-white” group who marched in Charlottesville last year was elected to a Republican Party post in Washington state last week, part of his campaign to take over the GOP for the alt-right. James Allsup, 22, attended the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists chanted anti-Semitic slogans and one allegedly drove a car into a crowd, killing a protester and injuring more. Allsup was filmed marching with Identity Evropa, an anti-immigrant alt-right group. Fallout over the rally led to Allsup stepping down as president of the Washington State University College Republicans, a group he once boasted of taking over. Now he claims he’s on the way to taking over the local GOP. Immediately after his election Allsup said he was attending a Spokane GOP dinner headlined by former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (who did not return The Daily Beast’s request for comment), and claimed he or an associate were scheduled for a private meeting with an unnamed congressperson.On June 2, Allsup posted a picture of a certificate on Facebook. “As of today I am officially an elected official in the state of Washington and Republican party,” he wrote. “Cool!”The piece of paper certified that Allsup was now a precinct committee officer for the Whitman County, Washington Republican Party. Allsup’s certificate declares that he was awarded the post after his candidacy remained uncontested for four days. The county’s auditor confirmed the certificate’s authenticity to The Daily Beast.Allsup’s post is a small one on its face, but it’s influential.“If you want to take over a political party in this state, the best thing to do is to start at the PCO level and get a whole bunch of people who agree with your views elected as PCOs,” Hugh Spitzer, a professor of law at the University of Washington, told The Daily Beast.PCO races are usually uncontested, and write-ins are not allowed, Spitzer said. “From the party’s perspective, the responsibility of PCOs is to visit every house and apartment if they can, meet the people, and then determine [how they might vote],” Spitzer said, adding that PCOs also carry campaign materials for their party’s candidates, and vote for members of their party’s county central committee, who influence the selection of party officials on a more statewide basis.The Republican National Committee denounced Allsup.“We condemn this individual and his hateful, racist views in the strongest possible terms,” a spokesperson for the RNC told The Daily Beast. “There’s no place for it in the Republican Party.”The Washington State Republican Party’s chairman told The Daily Beast the party doesn’t “condone identity politics, in any form, whatsoever,” adding,  “We condemned this hateful ideology before, we condemn it today, and will continue to condemn it in the future.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Shortly after posting a picture of certificate, Allsup appeared on a podcast by Identity Evropa where he encouraged members of the far-right to push their way into more mainstream conservative politics like he did.“I happen to be involved in the Spokane GOP. I am now actually an elected official in the Whitman County GOP down here where I live,” Allsup said. “You have a seat at the table. And that’s the most important thing, getting that seat at the table, and you can get that seat at the table by, yes, showing up, yes, by bringing people in, and again this doesn’t necessarily only have to be IE members.”Allsup clarified that he planned to push “our” political agenda—not the GOP’s.“Of course I’m not the GOP shill here. I’m not going to tell you that knocking doors for a Republican congressman is going to save the West or save European Americans,” he said. “That’s not at all what I’m saying, but it is a means to an end. This political involvement is a means to our political ends.”“I’m not going to tell you that knocking doors for a Republican congressman is going to save the West or save European Americans. This political involvement is a means to our political ends.”— James AllsupThis isn’t the first time Allsup has tried “entryist” tactics. A month after Charlottesville, Allsup told white nationalist podcast Fash the Nation that he tried to take over WSU’s College Republican club with “fashy goy” (fascist, non-Jewish) friends. “If you are a college guy, or a college girl, and you are on a college campus, if you have three or four fashy goy friends, you can take over your school’s College Republicans group and move it to essentially being an alt-right club,” Allsup said.“You can easily do that and it gives you access to so many more resources. It gives you political credibility. It gives you all of these things that come along with the name of being a Republican.”The “entryist” tactic worked for Allsup for a while in WSU’s College Republican club. As president of WSU’s College Republican club, he clashed with members who denounced his “Trumpist tone” and “xenophobia,” The Spokesman-Review previously reported. But Allsup’s attendance at Unite the Right, where he said he was invited to give a speech and filmed himself fawning over white nationalist Richard Spencer, was a step too far for some college Republicans. Allsup resigned from the group.But he stayed close to Identity Evropa, the group he was filmed marching with in Charlottesville.“If you have three or four fashy goy friends, you can take over your school’s College Republicans group and move it to essentially being an alt-right club.”— James AllsupFounded in 2016, Identity Evropa lifts its messaging from Europe’s identitarians: a movement that uses “pro-white” innuendo to push a racist reactionary message, particularly against immigrants. Identity Evropa’s founder Nathan Damigo entered the white nationalist movement reading a book by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke while in prison, where he was serving time for drunkenly robbing a Arab cab driver of $43 at gunpoint.Damigo stepped down after Unite the Right, to be replaced by Elliott Kline, an alt-righter who goes by “Eli Mosley” and who bragged on a podcast of supposedly killing Muslims while in Iraq.“I work in HR firing n----rs and spics all day,” he said during a March 2016 podcast. “Before that, I was in the army and I got to kill Muslims for fun. I’m not sure which one was better: watching n----rs and spics cry because they can’t feed their little mud children or watching Muslims brains spray on the wall. Honestly both probably suck compared to listening to a kike’s scream while in the oven.”A New York Times investigation revealed that Kline had lied about his military record, and had never been to Iraq. Kline left Identity Evropa in late November to be replaced by the group’s current leader, Patrick Casey, who recently described the group’s goal as a white “super majority” in America and a halt to all immigration.On the Identity Evropa podcast, Allsup said he hopes to streamline the group’s anti-immigrant rhetoric with that of the broader Republican Party. He used the example of a hypothetical alt-righter landing a community board seat and teaming up with more subtly racist members to steer funding and approvals away from pro-immigrant applicants.“We could certainly be advantageous in helping those people express their perhaps more deep-seated or implicit biases about immigration, perhaps, toward a larger audience,” Allsup said.The Whitman County GOP, of which Allsup is now a minor official, is the county’s largest political organization. Spitzer said Allsup’s uncontested election acts as a wake-up call to the local GOP, whom he described as more “traditional” Republicans: farmers and businesspeople.“While many of them are conservatives,” Spitzer said, “they’re not fascists.”"},
 {'title': 'Mick Mulvaney Used Old Campaign Funds to Cover Interest Payments on His Loans',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'When White House budget director Mick Mulvaney repaid personal loans to his state Senate campaign in September, he was digging himself out of a bit of a financial hole.Mulvaney had loaned his South Carolina campaign thousands of dollars to cover interest payments on other six-figure loans that he used to finance his state-level campaigns before being elected to Congress in 2010.It’s a problematic situation in which many Americans find themselves: borrowing money to pay debt service on other borrowed money. But for Mulvaney, the situation was particularly ironic: Two months after he repaid his personal loans to his state Senate campaign, he was tapped to be the nation’s top financial consumer watchdog—an office that has tried to help consumers avoid just those sorts of debt traps.In September 2017, before he was appointed acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he quietly transferred $32,544 from his congressional campaign account—essentially, unspent donations to his House runs—to his old state Senate campaign.About half of that money went toward repaying personal loans that Mulvaney had made to his state Senate campaign. The rest paid off debt owed to a South Carolina bank from which he had drawn six-figure lines of credit with interest rates as high as 6.5 percent. Beginning in 2011, Mulvaney had begun lending his state campaign money to make interest payments on those loans, one of which he refinanced in 2014.Mulvaney’s post-congressional campaign expenditures have drawn criticism for other reasons. In March, the American Democracy Legal Fund, a Democratic-leaning legal advocacy group, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Mulvaney was illegally using leftover campaign funds to pay personal expenses.Not all of the money Mulvaney used to repay his loans and the interest on them came from run-of-the-mill South Carolinian voters. A portion of Mulvaney’s campaign funds was donated by lobbyists and business executives who have enjoyed access to the White House Office of Management and Budget director since he gained that post in February 2017, as The Daily Beast reported Friday.Those and other donors financed four congressional runs in all. But Mulvaney never had a particularly close race. He won election and three subsequent re-election contests by no fewer than 10 percentage points—and, in 2014 and 2016, by more than 20.So while his campaign donors were indeed funding federal political efforts, they also appear to have chipped in for travel, meals, and other miscellaneous expenses after Mulvaney joined the White House. And whether they knew it or not, they also allowed Mulvaney to dig himself out of a financial hole he’d dug for himself.'},

  'body': 'In a new book, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) writes that his battle with brain cancer has given him a sense of liberation to vote and speak his mind.“This is my last term,” McCain writes in his upcoming book The Restless Wave, which he co-authored with former adviser Mark Salter. An excerpt of the book was posted Monday on Apple News.“If I hadn’t admitted that to myself before this summer, a stage 4 cancer diagnosis acts as ungentle persuasion,” McCain continues. “I’m freer than colleagues who will face the voters again. I can speak my mind without fearing the consequences much. And I can vote my conscience without worry. I don’t think I’m free to disregard my constituents’ wishes, far from it. I don’t feel excused from keeping pledges I made. Nor do I wish to harm my party’s prospects. But I do feel a pressing responsibility to give Americans my best judgment.”The book, which comes as McCain remains in Arizona undergoing treatment, includes sharp shots at President Donald Trump, according to the Apple News write up. “He has declined to distinguish the actions of our government from the crimes of despotic ones,” McCain writes. “The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values.”Describing the political environment overall, the Arizona Republican writes that he is dismayed by the “scarcity of humility in politics these days.” “I suspect it’s never been in abundant supply in most human enterprises,” McCain writes according to the excerpt. “And I don’t mean modesty. Any politician worth a damn can fake modesty. Humility is the self-knowledge that you possess as much inherent dignity as anyone else, and not one bit more. Among its other virtues, humility makes for more productive politics.”In a seeming nod to his physical condition, McCain writes of his desire “to see our politics begin to return to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the history of other nations.” Before he “leaves,” he added, “I would like to see us recover our sense that we are more alike than different.”“We are citizens of a republic made of shared ideals forged in a new world to replace the tribal enmities that tormented the old one,” McCain writes. “Even in times of political turmoil such as these, we share that awesome heritage and the responsibility to embrace it.”'},

Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat from Connecticut, announced Monday that she will not seek re-election after The Washington Post revealed that she kept her chief of staff in his position for three months after learning that he allegedly harassed and threatened another staffer. “I have determined that it is in the best interest of my constituents and my family to end my time in Congress at the end of this year and not seek re-election,” Esty wrote in a statement. “Too many women have been harmed by harassment in the workplace,” the three-term congresswoman continued. “In the terrible situation in my office, I could have and should have done better. To the survivor, I want to express my strongest apology for letting you down. In Congress, and workplaces across the country, we need stronger workplace protections and to provide employees with a platform to raise concerns, address problems, and work to reduce and eliminate such occurrences, in the first place. In my final months in Congress, I will use my power to fight for action and meaningful change.”Earlier in the day, Esty had asked the House Ethics Committee to look into the incident and determine if she had done anything wrong. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also reprimanded Esty saying: “As Congresswoman Esty has acknowledged, her actions did not protect Ms. Kain and should have." She had previously apologized last week but said she had no plans to resign. According to the Post, Esty discovered in May 2016 that Tony Baker, then her chief of staff, threatened to kill former colleague Anna Kain. He reportedly remained on the job for three months after Esty discovered the incident. Baker eventually left with a letter of recommendation. Kain additionally alleged that when she and Baker dated, he punched and sexually harassed her.Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, said “Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty’s decision not to run for another term is the right one."

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A week before Donald Trump announced that he was scuttling a high-profile summit with Kim Jong Un, White House officials were “stood up” by their North Korean counterparts at a planned meeting in Singapore, according to a senior administration official. During a conference call with surrogates on Thursday afternoon, Deputy Assistant to the President for Asian Affairs Matt Pottinger did not explicitly say that the non-connection in Singapore was directly responsible for Trump canceling the summit. But he painted it as a contributing factor to ultimately canceling the bilateral meeting. “Unfortunately there’s been a succession of broken promises that have given the United States pause,” Pottinger said. The call was conducted on an off-the-record condition. However, The Daily Beast was not a party to the call and was briefed by a source who recounted Pottinger’s comments.Pottinger revealed that the White House sent an advance team to Singapore–including at least one deputy chief of staff—to meet with the North Koreans and discuss logistics for the possible summit. “There they waited for three days,” Pottinger told conference callers. “The North Koreans never showed up. They never told us anything. They just stood us up.”The silence persisted through the subsequent week until a North Korean official accused Vice President Mike Pence of being a “politically dummy.” “Over the last six days the United States made numerous attempts to communicate with the North Koreans and they never responded to any of those efforts to communicate and to coordinate in advance of the 12 June summit,” Pottinger said. Early Thursday, the White House released a letter from President Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un lamenting the failure to agree on a summit and implicitly threatening the North with mention of the “massive and powerful” U.S. nuclear arsenal “that I pray to God they will never have to be used.”Pottinger said that Trump dictated “every word” of the letter to Kim, a fact corroborated to The Daily Beast by another White House source.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Thursday he doubted the veracity of a bombshell NBC News report from earlier in the day that federal authorities wiretapped the president’s longtime counsel, Michael Cohen. “Us lawyers have talked about it, we don’t believe it’s true,” Giuliani told The Daily Beast. “We think it’s going to turn out to be untrue because it would be totally illegal. You can’t wiretap a lawyer, you certainly can’t wiretap his client who’s not involved in the investigation. No one has suggested that Trump was involved in that investigation. So they’re going to wiretap the lawyer, his client, and his client the president of the United States? I don’t think so, not if they want to stay out of jail. Disclosing a wiretap is a federal felony. I never took ’em home when I was a U.S. attorney.”Giuliani said that he found out about the wiretap news from NBC News’ report, which cited “two people with knowledge of the legal proceedings,” and not from Cohen himself. Later on Thursday, NBC corrected its report to say that while the feds were able to monitor Cohen’s calls they were not listening in on them. Giuliani said he believed someone in the Justice Department was behind the initial leak. “Nobody else would know about it,” Giuliani said. “Cohen didn’t know about it, so it has to be the FBI, the independent counsel, or the Justice Department.“Anybody who says that I’m exaggerating when I say that this is an out-of-control investigation and they’re acting like storm troopers—give me a break, baby! They prove it every day.”Though Giuliani insisted otherwise, lawyers can, in fact, be wiretapped under special circumstances, according to legal experts.“There are limitations on intercepting attorney-client conversations and if you do intercept one, what they’re supposed to do is segregate that conversation and present it to the judge,” Ken White, a former federal prosecutor, told The Daily Beast. White said the same policy doesn’t strictly ban the wiretapping of lawyers.“That sort of thing happens all the time if you’re doing mob wiretaps,” he said. “That would be the classic type of scenario, when they’re calling their lawyer or their fixer or whatever. But there’s not an absolute prohibition on wiretapping a lawyer.”Renato Mariotti, another former federal prosecutor, said it’s “highly unusual” for the feds to wiretap lawyers. “I don’t personally recall a time it was done,” he said. “I was a federal prosecutor for over nine years in Chicago, which is one of the biggest U.S. attorneys offices in the country, and I don’t personally know of a time when an attorney’s phone was wiretapped. But there’s no reason why it can’t be.”Giuliani’s comments are the latest in a media blitz that has upended previous Trump-world talking points and caused ripple effects across a variety of legal and political fronts. Only recently added to Trump’s legal team, the former New York City mayor said that the Cohen news makes him even more hesitant to let the president sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller for his separate probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.

 {'title': 'Judge Hands Defeat to Trump and Cohen Over FBI Raid: ‘You’ve Miscited the Law’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump and his longtime attorney Michael Cohen both lost a court challenge related to the FBI’s seizure of Cohen’s documents they both claim are protected by attorney-client privilege. Cohen had asked a federal judge for a temporary restraining order to stop federal prosecutors in Manhattan from viewing the information seized by the FBI until an independent third party, called a “special master,” be allowed to sort out what is protected by attorney-client privilege. Similarly, Trump’s own legal representation in this case, Joanna Hendon, filed a letter on Sunday night asking the judge to give Cohen’s team first-access to the material.U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood denied the requests and ruled that prosecutors will get first access to the information, followed by Cohen’s defense team ten days later. Wood noted that she has not yet decided whether she will appoint a special master in the case at all.“It’s not that you’re not good people,” Wood told Cohen’s attorneys on Monday afternoon, near the end of the two-hour proceeding. “It’s that you’ve miscited the law.”Wood told both sides to review the documents quickly and to prepare “proposals for how we can move fast” on the case going forward.The materials seized by FBI agents from Cohen’s home, office, safety deposit box, and hotel room includes “documents relating to communications with the president of the United States covered by the attorney-client privilege,” Cohen’s lawyer, Todd Harrison, said in Monday’s letter to Wood. Prosecutors have said that they went to extreme lengths to avoid violating Cohen’s (and the president’s) attorney-client privilege: they plan to have a “taint team” of uninvolved prosecutors sort the materials before turning the information over to investigators.“I have faith in the Southern District U.S. Attorney’s office that their integrity is unimpeachable,” Judge Wood said. “I think that a taint team is a viable option.”Prosecutors reportedly sought information about Cohen’s role in facilitating hush-money payments to Trump’s alleged mistress, porn star Stormy Daniels, and his potential role in facilitating a payout to ex-Playmate Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 election. Both women claim they had affairs with Trump and have sued to be released from their NDAs. The raids were “the result of a months-long investigation into Cohen” and his “own business dealings,” prosecutors said in a Friday filing.Daniels arrived in court on Monday wearing a lavender skirt-suit and black heels as she flew by a chorus of camera shutters. Her media-savvy attorney, Michael Avenatti, told The Washington Post last week that he and his client would be at the hearing to make sure that “the integrity of the documents, whatever was seized, is maintained.” Daniels sat silently in the right-hand corner of the room while reporters passed their business cards to Avenatti.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Cohen’s team claimed in the Monday filing that Hannity’s identity was protected under attorney-client privilege, but the U.S. Attorney’s office disagreed, alleging that Cohen’s team was simply employing a delaying tactic.“Cohen has more attorneys than he has clients,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas McKay quipped.Cohen attorney Steve Ryan argued that the third client—Hannity—is a “publicly prominent individual,” who did not want his name released.“I’m simply trying to protect the privacy of that individual,” he added.After much discussion, Wood ruled that the name must be publicly disclosed immediately.“The client’s name is Sean Hannity,” replied Todd Harrison, Cohen’s attorney. The room erupted in laughter.Separately, Hannity said he never “retained” Cohen as representation in any legal matters involving third parties but has “sought legal advice from Michael” about “real estate” in the past.McKay emphasized on Monday that “there’s nothing improper about the way the search warrants were executed in this case.”Officials took up to 10 “physical boxes” of documents, McKay said, noting that the “real volume” is made up of the seized electronic files.“Cohen’s signature line in his email box used to say special counsel to the Trump Organization,” said McKay. “Now it says personal attorney to the president.”For his part, Cohen has given few public statements about the ordeal, with the exception of this comment last week: “I just want my stuff back.”“Candidly, this man’s life has been turned upside down in the last week,” Cohen’s attorney said on Monday, adding a Trumpian flourish: “I believe the Russia case with respect to my client is a complete dry hole.”"},
 {'title': 'How Beto O’Rourke Is Building a Digital Fundraising Army',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) knew, at the outset, that his campaign to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) would be a long shot. Texas had not voted for a Democratic senator in 25 years, O’Rourke didn’t have statewide name recognition, and, moreover, he was pledging to run without taking money from political action committees—a potentially healthy spigot of campaign funds that he would be foregoing. \xa0To overcome those odds, the Texas Democrat and his top aides placed a major bet on a novel strategy: they would dramatically break down the barriers between candidate and voter. O’Rourke would make heavy use of social media to essentially broadcast otherwise mundane daily functions. And he would treat the often-pesky task of campaign fundraising as an ongoing conversation rather than a plea for cash. “Hola, from Southwest Flight 274, Austin to D.C., seat 15C. What a weekend,” read one illustrative February 26 email from O’Rourke to his subscribers, an email that also included over a dozen pictures of the Democratic candidate for Senate, mostly framed in crowd shots on his travels across the Lone Star state.So far, at least, O’Rourke’s bet has paid off, and it’s paid off big. The campaign announced this past Monday that it had raised an excess of $6.7 million in the first fundraising quarter of 2018 with more than 141,000 contributions. That number nearly matches the massive haul Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) had in the first quarter of her 2012 campaign. In three of the four reporting periods so far, O’Rourke has outraised Cruz. And operatives and advisers are now confidently predicting that O’Rourke will raise the most online of any candidate in Senate history, building a formidable list of supporters along the way akin to that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).“This is the hallmark of a Bernie-style fundraising message—that it's not only about the candidate, and it's not some consultants trying to scam a bunch of old people for $3. It's about inspiring people to do something most might call impossible,” a Democratic digital fundraiser, requesting to speak candidly on background, told The Daily Beast. No longer considered such a longshot, O’Rourke owes his fundraising success to more than just his informal, conversational approach. Cruz’s bete noire status among liberals has certainly played a role as well, not to mention the broader climate that is favoring progressive-minded candidates, even in Texas.But the O’Rourke fundraising operation is still proving to be a remarkable success, one that some of the top digital operatives in the Democratic Party believe could be foundational for future campaigns. At the heart of the operation is a basic idea: that flooding the zone is fundamentally a good thing. Voters can see O’Rourke all the time, in emails, videos and tweets that the campaign posts every day. He broadcasts from settings that politicians normally shun or find so incredibly mundane that they don’t think there is any particular advantage in advertising. He did a Facebook Live post while in line for Whataburger, and during his wait to get a haircut, and while he got gas, and as his son climbed a tree, and as he picked up donuts, and while he drove across the country with Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX). He’s live streamed his jogs, only to be joined by other joggers who have live streamed his live stream. “People wake up early to run with him through the streets of Texas like he is Rocky fucking Balboa,” said one awestruck Democratic operative. Those close to O’Rourke insist that he is making the decisions about when and where to post—something he’s done since his first run for Congress in El Paso in 2012—and that he genuinely wants to be seen as much as possible since he can’t knock on every door in Texas. The goal is to give voters the sensation that they’re actually playing a role in his David and Goliath campaign. And while the cumulative effect has been a smashing success, even close associates concede that they’re still not sure which particular post will work best. \xa0“Did we pick up a lot of donors because they saw him getting a haircut on livestream? I have no idea,” a source directly familiar with the campaign told The Daily Beast. Campaigns have tried this approach before. But the candidate who operatives view as the first to innovate in this fashion failed miserably at doing so.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.During the 2008 presidential election, Sen. Chris Dodd’s (D-CT) digital team spearheaded the use of stripped-down, informal emails, it posted real time updates of donor drives, and ran debate-clocks to monitor how much time (or, in Dodd’s case, how little) each candidate was allowed to speak. Through the service Ustream (a precursor to Periscope and Facebook live) it ran live feeds of the campaign office, of staff interacting with supporters, and of the candidate on the road. Occasionally, it would run all three at once. Dodd dropped out after moving his family to Iowa and still finished with less than one percent of the vote. Others have used similar tactics to better effect. Sen Rand Paul (R-KY) drew attention for broadcasting a whole day on the trail in 2015, an event made even more notable when he called it a “dumbass livestream” while broadcasting. O’Rourke is using “the same tools as a presidential operation,” a Democrat directly familiar with the candidate’s operation told The Daily Beast. In fact, the O’Rourke campaign is employing two firms best known for their work on presidential campaigns: Blue State Digital technology, which worked on Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 runs and Revolution Messaging, which was on Sanders’ 2016 effort.At Revolution, there is one person in particular who operatives say is playing a major role in O’Rourke’s fundraising bonanza. Shelby Cole, a senior digital strategist who is from Texas and has worked a number of smaller campaigns there previously, is point person on the O’Rourke account. Before joining the firm, she ran the email program for Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate Russ Feingold. Feingold lost his bid for his old seat in 2016, but Cole helped him raise $7.4 million online. Revolution did not make her available for an interview and instead referred The Daily Beast to O’Rourke’s campaign. But other operatives who have worked with Cole praised her ability to help sell a candidate to voters without relying on desperate fundraising appeals like some of those much-maligned emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “You can’t look at your supporters as an ATM,” said Josh Orton, former senior adviser to Feingold, told The Daily Beast. “People want to open the emails because they know that they’re being treated like members of a community, members of a movement.”With Cole at the helm, O’Rourke’s team has put this concept into practice better than anyone else currently running. The campaign’s objective has been to build a so-called “ladder of engagement.” If one were to go to O’Rourke’s website at the start of the campaign and sign up out of interest, what might come next would be an ask for that person to sign a petition. After that could come a fundraising appeal. And once there was a committed list of people, the campaign could then ask them to knock on doors or make phone calls on the candidate’s behalf. This allows voters to feel as if they’re being talked to, as opposed to targeted. And O’Rourke supplements that by breaking down walls that exist between himself and the voter, with little flourishes like signing the emails he writes, sending some from his wife Amy, and relaying small vignettes from the trail. One such vignette came in the form of an email from February 2018, when O’Rourke’s campaign told a story about the candidate meeting a man in Archer City, Texas, who had explained to the congressman that the last Senate candidate who came to his city was Lyndon Johnson in 1948.“Keep me on the road,” the email reads. “Keep me doing this the right way, meeting the people that I want to represent and serve.”O’Rourke and his campaign are still tinkering with his approach, cognizant that donations are coming from all types of people and sources. Some donate via the emails and some when they see a comment on one of the Facebook Live streams. As successful as he has been to date, there is room to grow. The vast majority of O’Rourke’s contributors have likely not maxed out, meaning that, as his conversation with them continues, they will likely be giving again. “If I’m Ted Cruz, I look at that and go ‘oh shit, O'Rourke can go back to these donors over and over again,’” Orton said.

  'body': "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was en route to North Korea on Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced.While the exact purpose of the trip was not immediately clear, Trump said only that Pompeo was heading there for preparations ahead of the proposed summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Congressional aides familiar with the trip told The Daily Beast that Pompeo traveled to North Korea as part of U.S. efforts to secure the release of three Americans imprisoned there.Later Tuesday, South Korean officials said North Korea had committed to releasing the American prisoners in conjunction with Pompeo’s visit.“At this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong Un. Plans are being made, relationships are building,” Trump said during a speech explaining his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal.Pompeo’s North Korea trip will be his second to the country. Last month, he traveled to Pyongyang and met with the North Korean leader to begin planning the expected meeting between Trump and Kim.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined to elaborate on the exact purpose of the trip in a statement earlier Tuesday. “The secretary is en route to meet with DPRK representatives.\xa0We cannot disclose the location of his meetings,” she said. “He is traveling to prepare for the historic meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un.\xa0We have no further announcement.”Trump hinted at an eventual release of the American prisoners in a tweet last week, writing: “As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!”As part of his media blitz last week, Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said during a Fox News interview that “we got Kim Jong Un impressed enough to be releasing three prisoners today.” That remark caused top administration officials to scramble.Nauert sought to distance the administration from Giuliani’s comments, saying the former mayor “speaks for himself and not on behalf of the administration on foreign policy.”Two of the prisoners held by North Korea, Tony Kim and Kim Hak-Song, were arrested during the course of Trump’s presidency. North Korea’s state-run news outlet said Tony Kim was arrested at the airport while waiting for a flight in April 2017 “for committing criminal acts of hostility aimed to overturn the DPRK not only in the past but also during his last stay before interception.” Kim had been working in North Korea as an accounting professor at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The university was founded and led by James Kim, an American evangelical Christian who himself was arrested by North Korea in 1998 and charged with espionage.

Kim became a naturalized American citizen in 2008 and had been working at the university as an agricultural researcher, helping the North to develop new technology to improve food production.A third detainee, Kim Dong-Chul, was taken in 2015. North Korean media claimed that Kim had been “caught in the act of receiving a USB and documents with classified information of nuclear activities, military and internal reality of the DPRK” allegedly passed to him by an unnamed person in the North’s Rason Special Economic Zone. In court, Kim confessed to working with U.S. and South Korean intelligence to spy on Pyongyang—a claim widely dismissed as the result of coercion by the North—and was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported last week that all three prisoners had been moved from a labor camp to a hotel near Pyongyang in apparent preparation for their release."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Cambridge Analytica hoped to capitalize on Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton and her ally, an email written by one of its employees indicates. Emily Cornell, the employee, sent the email on July 29, 2016. It went out to people working with Make America Number One, the pro-Trump super PAC funded by Republican super-donors Robert and Rebekah Mercer. After noting some of the firm’s work for the super PAC, Cornell wrote: “With her campaign getting hacked, I can only imagine what a new swatch [sic] of emails will do to her already fractured base!” Cornell did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the email. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica also did not respond to requests for comment. On July 22, seven days before Cornell’s email, WikiLeaks had published almost 20,000 emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The hack—which included emails showing some DNC officials pushing for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the primary—threw the Democratic Party into turmoil. Then-DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from her post because of the hack. On July 27, then-candidate Trump said in a press conference that he hoped Kremlin-backed individuals would find emails Clinton deleted as secretary of State. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said.His allies later said he was joking. Cambridge Analytica has drawn intense scrutiny since the election. This week, the U.K.’s Channel 4 released two documentaries on the company’s internal practices based on hidden-camera footage. In one, a Cambridge Analytica official says the company used Ukrainian sex workers to try to entrap its clients’ political foes. “Just saying we could bring some Ukrainians in,” the firm’s CEO Alexander Nix said to journalists posing as prospective clients. “They are very beautiful. I find that works very well.”Cambridge Analytica announced Tuesday it has suspended Nix pending an independent investigation. “Mr. Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,” the firm said in a statement.'},
 {'title': 'Miss Universe 2013 Host Thomas Roberts Confirms: Trump Stayed Overnight in Moscow',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'In a fateful private White House dinner early last year, President Donald Trump raised with then-FBI Director James Comey the issue of “the golden showers thing”—a particularly salacious portion of an intelligence dossier claiming Trump hired Russian prostitutes to urinate on a Moscow hotel-room bed in 2013, while he was in town for the Miss Universe pageant.According to Comey’s memos about that conversation, Trump claimed it was impossible for him to have done any such thing, because “he had spoken to people who had been on... the trip with him and they had reminded him that he didn’t stay over night in Russia for that.”All available evidence proves otherwise—from flight records obtained by Politico to social media posts from the time to testimony from Trump’s own bodyguard. And now there’s more proof.Thomas Roberts, host of that year’s Miss Universe pageant, confirmed to The Daily Beast on Tuesday that Trump was in Moscow for one full night and at least part of another.“The first time I met Donald Trump it was in Moscow on November 8th, 2013,” the former NBC anchor said. “I taped a sit-down interview with Trump the next day on November 9th. That was also the date for the Miss Universe broadcast.” Roberts continued: “During the after-party for the Miss Universe event, Mr. Trump offered to fly me and my husband back to New York. He said he would be leaving directly from the party. We were unable to accept the invitation. That was the early morning hours of November 10th.”Roberts’ retelling of those days in Moscow represents one of the first public contradictions of the timeline Trump offered Comey. While it does not necessarily prove the existence of a so-called pee tape, it does raise further questions as to why the president misled his one-time FBI director in the first place. The findings of the dossier have already been of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team, with news emerging a few weeks ago that it had corroborated portions of the explosive document. Asked whether he has been interviewed by Mueller’s team, Roberts told The Daily Beast: “No comment.”'},
 {'title': 'Democrats Are Primed to Win Big, Reclaim the House, and Save Our Democracy. Here’s How They Could Blow It.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "GOP Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania announced this month that he was resigning from Congress and told Republicans: “Big wave coming—get off the beach.”Dent is probably right. A little more than six months before the midterms, predictive models point to Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives. A strong history of pick-ups by the party out of the White House, disgust with President Trump, good results in special elections, 46 Republican retirements (compared to 20 Democrats), and an energized Democratic base all augur well.The question isn’t whether the odds favor flipping the House, but whether Democrats should bank on it. And the answer—for anyone who cares about protecting American democracy—is an obvious no. Six months is a lifetime in politics. Trump’s popularity won’t recover by fall, but a deal with North Korea and a couple of other breaks could shift the momentum just enough to protect vulnerable Republican seats. And the recent history of midterms strongly favors Republicans, who took the House in 2010. In 2014, turnout fell to 37 percent, the lowest in 70 years, with the steepest falloff among Democrats.Most Democrats get it; they’re focused and girded for battle, with a bumper crop of young and exciting candidates, including a record number of women. But too many others wring their hands watching cable news without educating themselves about which seats in their states are in play and what they can do to flip them. And a remnant of lefties are still living in Jill Steinland—acting as if the midterms are in the bag and they can indulge in expensive primary fights over minor policy differences that drain resources from the constitutionally critical task at hand.Are Democrats in danger of once again forming a circular firing squad? The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is so worried that it’s pressuring weaker candidates in some districts to drop out in favor of well-funded moderates with a better chance of winning in November. California, where a half dozen seats are flippable (one quarter of those needed to gain control), is a particular concern because the state’s “top two” primary system means a large field of Democrats could split the vote and leave two Republicans running against each other in the general election. Liberal activists say pressure from the DCCC and other Washington types is exactly what they dislike about the Democratic establishment. It’s the same thinking, they claim, that forced the party to nominate Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Their message: Don’t ram moderates down our throats!The problem with this argument is that it ignores the mechanics of actually winning elections, which require party discipline and rejection of the narcissism of small differences. Nominating the most liberal Democratic candidate in a Republican district may feel principled but it reeks of moral vanity. Democrats with their heads screwed on right are reviving an old ethic: party and country over personal preference. In swing districts, that means often resisting the natural inclination to support the candidate they like best in favor of the one who can win in November. In Trump’s America, pragmatism is a moral imperative. Litmus tests—on support for a single payer health care system or even gun safety—are unaffordable luxuries in this year’s primaries. In 1980, Ronald Reagan issued his famous 11th Commandment—“Thou Shalt Not Speak Ill of Another Republican.” With the GOP violating that dictum every day, we’ll see if Democrats pick it up and play as a team for a change. The DNC might consider asking each primary candidate to sign a pledge committing to campaign for the winner.Lest we forget: The stakes are the highest of any midterm election in memory. Imagine if House Republicans sustain heavy losses but hang onto their majority (24 seats as of now) by a few seats. This confounding of baked-in expectations would depress millions and have profound consequences for American life. At a minimum, it would mean: The end of any investigation of Trump, whose presidency would be immediately normalized, with all that implies for his I-told-you-so behavior; new life for a right-wing legislative agenda that would include slashing social spending and, quite likely, finishing off Obamacare; even less oversight of federal agencies emboldened to wreak havoc.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Now imagine if Democrats, in the face of gerrymandered districts and financial disadvantages, re-take the House. It then wouldn’t matter nearly as much if Trump fired Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, and the rest of the Department of Justice. The Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee could hire a large staff to pick up where Mueller left off and use its subpoena power to complete the probe. Even if a Democratic House didn’t vote articles of impeachment (and it probably would), we might finally get to the bottom of Russian intrusion in American elections and Trump’s myriad other assaults on the rule of law. When they speak privately, a surprising number of Republicans agree that their party needs a whipping this year so the process of small-d democratic and small r-republican renewal can begin. Accountability can’t wait. Imagine EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt having to answer for his corruption and vanity on Capitol Hill. He literally wouldn’t have time to redesign his seal, much less trash the environment. Then multiply the idea of true congressional oversight across the federal government. The lame questions aging senators asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg have obscured just how potent an energized majority can be when it wants to tie up a dangerous president in knots. All the country needs is one house of Congress under the control of Democrats to remove or reduce the threat Trump poses in every area except foreign policy. Even there, a Democratic House would find ways to check his power, summoning national security adviser John Bolton to answer for any warmongering. This new world of accountability depends, of course, on money. Well-funded special-election victories for Democrats are misleading; it’s much harder to crowd-source across dozens of districts. Despite slightly more contributions for competitive races, Democrats still trail overall. So far, the Republican Party has raised about $262 million and the Democrats about $206 million for 2018. Some of the Republican haul comes from the $400 million pledged in January by the political network controlled by the Koch brothers, which is aimed at maintaining the party’s control of Congress and the state legislatures that will draw the all-important legislative maps after the 2020 census. Most of that $400 million won’t be donated and spent until the fall, when Democratic challengers now touted as likely winners could find themselves buried under mountains of cash. And we don’t know yet how much more might be coming from other Republican billionaires, for whom $10 or $20 million to GOP candidates in October is like a bar bill. The Mercer family has been sidelined by the Cambridge Analytica scandal but is still expected to kick in tens of millions.Money isn’t everything. To drive turnout, Democrats need a strong “kitchen table” economic agenda and bold ideas that move beyond identity politics. (Marijuana legalization, for instance, turns more young people on than old people off.) But the record conclusively shows you also need the Benjamins: The best-funded candidates almost always win in state and local races. That’s why squandering money and grassroots organizing in divisive primaries or contests far removed from competitive House seats is so aggravating. Every dollar that goes to those races is one less dollar for democracy’s main event in the fall.In New York, supporters of actress Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Sept. 13 Democratic primary, argue that even if she doesn’t win, at least she’s pushing Cuomo to the left. But it’s false for Nixon to charge that Cuomo, for all his faults, is “governing like a Republican.” No Republicans favor banning fracking, family and medical leave, and a big hike in the minimum wage, as Cuomo does.Most unions get this. Despite her Trump-like handicap (being a celebrity who has never held public office), Nixon last week received the endorsement and a line on the November ballot from the Working Families Party. This caused the two major unions that have long supported that progressive third party—the Service Employees International Union and the Communications Workers of\xa0America—to pull out of the WFP. They recognize that intra-party ideological struggle would be fine in almost any election but this one.After all, the New York-New Jersey region boasts at least a half dozen flippable House races. Many ostensibly “woke” New York Democrats are still asleep when it comes to Job One; they often can’t even name the vulnerable incumbent Republicans just a few miles away. If they wake up and research nearby districts, they may find that Nixon’s Not the One—that the one who will help rescue the country from Trump is a moderate military veteran or businessman who might not be their dream Democratic candidate but will do just fine in these circumstances.This same dynamic is at play across the country. In Ohio, former Rep. Dennis Kucinich is challenging Richard Cordray, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. It’s not just that Cordray is a fine public servant and Kucinich a leftwing gadfly who has played footsie with Trump and would likely lose to the Republican in November. The real reason Dennis is a menace is that he’s diverting energy and resources that could benefit inspiring House candidates in Republican districts, like Ken Harbaugh, an Iraq War veteran who co-founded the Mission Continues, in Ohio-7.This time, it’s all hands on deck. To flip the House, Democrats and other concerned Americans will have to dig deep in their pockets, subordinate their particular concerns to the cause of winning, and do what it takes to protect democracy.

  'body': "Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) on Sunday defended himself against criticism over his praise of the Democratic candidate seeking to replace him in the U.S. Senate, while at the same time offering an unenthusiastic endorsement of the Republican nominee.The senator, who is not running for re-election, accused GOP leaders of leaking the details of a conversation during which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reportedly rebuked him for speaking positively of former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, the Democratic nominee for Corker's soon-to-be-vacated seat, at a breakfast with reporters last week.“It’s hard to believe that the leadership of the senatorial committee on the Republican side would even leak that story out to The Washington Post and cause you to ask me about it,” Corker said on CNN’s State of the Union, referring to the Post’s Thursday report detailing the discussion between McConnell and Corker.McConnell was angry with Corker for calling Bredesen “a very good mayor, a very good governor, a very good business person.” The majority leader reportedly told Corker that those remarks were unhelpful for the GOP’s chances of retaining control of the chamber.Corker has said that he wouldn’t campaign against Bredesen because he is a friend. But he has thus far declined to publicly praise Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the outspoken Trump booster who is running against Bredesen, in a similar way. While Corker has said he would vote for Blackburn and has donated the maximum amount to her campaign, he offered an unenthusiastic endorsement of the congresswoman.During appearances on both CNN and ABC, Corker declined to even mention her name, referring to her as “the nominee” and “this person.” When asked why Blackburn would be a better replacement, Corker did not praise her candidacy and instead argued that her election to fill his seat would help Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate.“I think most people in our state—it is a red state—will focus on the first vote she makes, and that’s the vote to elect the majority leader. And I think at the end of the day that’s going to be a big factor in the race,” Corker, the chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on CNN, later adding: “You know I’m supporting the nominee. I’ve worked with the nominee for some time. And I don’t know what else to say.”Corker’s refusal to outwardly campaign for the GOP nominee comes at a particularly thorny time for Senate Republicans, who are already fretting over the possibility that Democrats could re-take control of the chamber in a year when the GOP has a built-in advantage.Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority, but this year’s map is decidedly unfavorable toward Democrats, with 10 of them running for re-election in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016.In Tennessee, where Trump won by more than 25 points, a recent poll showed Bredesen ahead of Blackburn by 10 points."},

And since there was “consideration” (Daniels’ silence) for the money, Cohen can’t claim to the IRS that the payment was a “gift.”\xa0That raises the possibility of tax fraud and it starts with one simple question: Were any taxes paid on the alleged hush money?Cohen should have filed a Form 1099-Misc report with the IRS, alerting everyone of the payment of taxable income of $130,000. Prior to that, Cohen also should have requested and obtained a Federal Employment Identification Number (FEIN) from the IRS for Essential Consultants LLC, because he knew he would be processing payments through this shell company.\xa0Essential Consultants is the same company that was used to receive $62,500 from Elliott Broidy, a top Republican fundraising official who paid Cohen to negotiate a nondisclosure agreement with Broidy’s mistress, a Playboy model. This payment apparently was the first installment of a purported $250,000 commission directed to Cohen for his work, The Wall Street Journal reported. It’s also the second report to emerge of a secret conduit for Cohen to move money in and out in a concealed fashion.No wonder Cohen’s bank, First Republic, issued a suspicious activity report (SAR) to the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Center (FinCEN), according to the Journal. SARs are automatically reviewed by special agents of the IRS Criminal Investigation unit. SARs were also the trigger that set off the investigations of Gov. Elliott Spitzer of New York (for paying escorts through a shell company) and ex-Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (for illegally structuring payments to pay off a victim of sexual abuse).\xa0It is not a crime to conspire to keep an affair secret for money, but conspiracies oftentimes have multiple objectives. Impeding, impairing, and obstructing the IRS from ascertaining the correct amount of tax due with regard to Daniels’ 2016 personal income tax return could be viewed as a criminal conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, known to prosecutors as a “Klein conspiracy.”\xa0Evidence of a Klein conspiracy must include, in addition to “an agreement,” evidence of overt acts engaged in by one or more conspirators to further the conspiracy. And this is where Cohen has some explaining to do. “If the payment to Daniels in exchange for her silence was completely above-board, why didn’t Cohen simply write a check from his personal account to Daniels?”If the payment to Daniels in exchange for her silence was completely above-board, why didn’t Cohen simply write a check from his personal account to Daniels? It may be that Cohen did not want anyone, including the IRS, to know about this “hush money” payment. Cohen sought to conceal this payment from all eyes, including government agencies. Evidence of Cohen’s intent include multiple overt acts for the purpose of misleading and concealing the payment of the money from the IRS. The definition of an affirmative act of tax evasion is “any conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or conceal.”There is evidence already in the public record that Cohen sought to conceal this payment from all eyes—including government agencies. First, he established Essential Consultants for the express purpose of “facilitating” the payment of the hush money in a secretive manner. Second, he provided pseudonyms to everyone involved in the NDA to further conceal their identities (“Peggy Peterson” for Daniels, “David Dennison” for Trump). Third, Cohen sent a wire transfer of $130,000 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC to the client-trust account of Clifford’ lawyer, Keith Davidson, instead of directly to Daniels. Fourth, the payment was styled in the name “Peggy Peterson,” not Daniels (real name, Stephanie Clifford).\xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Now hopefully Clifford did the right thing by timely reporting her receipt of the $130,000 to the IRS on her 2016 tax return. It is however not likely: A Jan. 10, 2018, letter from Cohen containing Clifford’s signature emphatically denies receipt of any hush money. This letter would likely be viewed by IRS Criminal Investigation, and a federal prosecutor, as a false statement further advancing the conspiracy hatched by Cohen. If she intentionally omitted the payment from her tax returns, then she could be subject to a criminal investigation for tax violations as well.Daniels may well have paid her proper taxes now that she has made a public admission regarding the receipt of the “hush money,” but the conspiracy in the eyes of prosecutors would have been committed when the NDA was signed, the money paid, and the overt acts designed to conceal and mislead were conducted.Should any of the conspirators (including possibly Daniels’ former lawyer Davidson, who received the wire transfer into his attorney-client account) choose to cop a plea and flip, for the purpose of cooperating with the government, prosecutors would have another target in mind. It was recently said that Daniels has been contacted and is now cooperating with federal investigators.\xa0“David Dennison” may be in denial about Cohen’s legal danger, but the danger is clear despite all the concealment."},
 {'title': 'Progressives Turn Up the Heat on Mueller Protection Bill',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A bipartisan congressional effort to shield special counsel Robert Mueller from presidential interference is getting a new boost from progressive activists—but it’s one that might not be welcome by the bill’s sponsors, who warn that such intense lobbying campaigns from liberals could scare off the necessary support from Republicans.Stand Up America, an anti-Trump advocacy group that has more than 2 million members, is launching a new online effort designed to engage voters in a fervent lobbying campaign directed at their members of Congress, according to a draft of the group’s plans obtained by The Daily Beast.“Mueller is closing in on the truth, and Trump’s panicking. That’s why we need our members of Congress on the record: Will they protect the rule of law or join Trump’s coverup?” reads an email that members of the group will receive later Tuesday.The legislation, which aims to make it more difficult for President Donald Trump to fire the special counsel without proper cause, cleared a key hurdle last week when the Senate Judiciary Committee approved it with bipartisan support. The vote was 14 to 7, with all Democrats and four Republicans on the committee—including the chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA)—backing it. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) are the leading GOP co-sponsors.But the effort has run into a likely fatal wall of opposition from Senate Republican leaders who oppose the legislation because they believe that Trump will not move to fire Mueller, despite the president’s near-daily characterizations of the special counsel’s investigation as unfair and a “witch hunt.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has said definitely he will not give the legislation a vote on the Senate floor, essentially halting the legislation in its tracks.Stand Up America’s lobbying effort aims to change that by ramping up the pressure on lawmakers in a strategy similar to that of last year when progressive groups mobbed congressional offices and phone lines in opposition to Republicans’ efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The group’s campaign, which has its own web site, is launching later Tuesday, and it follows an effort that saw 40,000 calls to congressional offices in the weeks leading up to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s vote.But some proponents of the bill are worried that despite the intent, the progressive campaign could backfire. The legislative effort, which began last summer, was painstakingly billed as a bipartisan solution to further enshrine the credibility and independence of the Mueller investigation. The bill’s Democratic sponsors have been wary of lobbying efforts that make it appear like a partisan attack on the president, because they feel that it would prevent more Republicans from supporting their cause.“This isn’t, at the end of the day, an attack on President Trump,” a Senate aide directly involved in the effort told The Daily Beast.The aide, who was granted anonymity to candidly assess the new progressive campaign, said the legislation is “designed to strengthen our rule of law” and argued that while Trump has sparked concern among lawmakers for his suggestions that he would fire Mueller, the bill seeks to “address an issue that he’s unintentionally shone a light on.”'},
 {'title': 'Andrew Cuomo, With Hillary Clinton at His Side, Crushes Foes on His Left',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In New York the center is holding. For now. After initially struggling with how to respond to a high-profile Democratic primary challenger on his left in Cynthia Nixon, New York's centrist governor Andrew Cuomo seems to be back in a more solid position. And he got there as he embraced other centrist Democrats derided as relics. None other than Hillary Clinton delivered the keynote at Cuomo's state party convention Wednesday (he presented her with a bouquet of flowers, which made some observers cringe.). Former Vice-President Joe Biden followed with an introduction for Cuomo a day later.In between, Cuomo grabbed 95 percent of his party delegates, ensuring that Nixon would have to petition her way to the ballot in the September 13 primary. (While Cuomo’s support was suspiciously overwhelming, the convention was indeed held at Hofstra University on Long Island — not Pyongyang.) The party ended on a controversial note: Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, endorsed Cuomo, even as he’s said the party shouldn’t interfere in primaries. That’s led to charges the establishment is rigging the system against Nixon — as many claim it did at the expense of Bernie Sanders in 2016.But while it’s early, I wonder if Nixon is, like Sanders, firing up a vocal minority that remains just that: passionate, but unsuccessful at the ballot box in New York. So far I don’t see her ushering in a great Democratic Party crack-up, prompting a majority to oust its putative leader. Rather, Cuomo remains stable after simultaneously mastering four feats so quickly that I can still hear jaws dropping from Jones Beach to Lake Erie: he milked his control over his state party; \xa0convinced the party faithful that New York is resistance-central to the Trump administration (even as he helped Republicans in Albany stay in power in the State Senate); co-opted a left-ish platform; and seized quick-moving events that have changed this race.A poll from earlier this month shows Cuomo 22 points ahead in the primary (although Nixon leads among “very liberal” Democrats). If that enviable position holds in the next survey, the Governor may want to give New York City’s Public Advocate Tish James a gift subscription to the New Yorker. It was the magazine’s website that May 7 broke the story of how what Schneiderman says was perceived sexual role-playing — reportedly while intoxicated — was in the views of many women on the other end of it unwanted, painful, and potentially illegal abuse. Schneiderman resigned later that night. The story of his alleged abuse quickly replaced what we political reporters had been heretofore writing: Nixon was giving Cuomo trouble, leading him not only to exhibit some strange behavior, but to warm to positions he’d heretofore rejected: marijuana legalization; voting rights for parolees; unifying Democrats in the State Senate in Albany.The dominant local political story then morphed into who would replace Schneiderman. That \xa0brings us to James. Apart from leading the City should something happen to the Mayor, the public advocate doesn’t have too much power. But it is a warming spot for ambitious politicians; Bill de Blasio is James’ predecessor.With Schneiderman ousted, James seized the opening, jockeying first to replace him immediately as the choice of the State Legislature. Then, when that backroom deal — intended to open up a game of musical chairs for other politicians looking for a\xa0new office — was exposed to unwanted to scrutiny, James starting gunning solely for a full term as a new candidate.Enter Cuomo.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.For reasons that scratch heads still, James all but let Cuomo shepherd her through a process that helped neuter the governor’s political opponents while undermining her own base. James first won office on the Working Families Party line, where she has joked she’s “godmother.”.But then she refused to run on it again when it came to her first bid for statewide office. James at first denied that Cuomo was orchestrating the move, but it was hard to see otherwise. After supporting him four years ago — following a last-minute backroom deal brokered by Cuomo’s longtime frenemy Bill de Blasio — the Working Families Party now backs Nixon, and Cuomo has searched for ways to undermine it ever since. Cuomo is on his way in his WFP disembowelment campaign as local unions departed the party — with the international head of the subway workers union calling Nixon a “Prosecco-sipping Manhattanite masquerading as a progressive.” The farthest James went was May 21, allowing “there were some issues with a number of party leaders who had philosophical and political differences with the Working Families Party line.” She didn’t specify who those party leaders were, but it wasn’t hard to read between the lines. She’s never been a prolific fundraiser. Cuomo may help her; as of his last filing, in January, he had $30.4 million.In New York, politicians can run on more than one line simultaneously. And working with Democratic leaders, Cuomo helped land James the overwhelming support of the state Democratic party. In return, the pair joined hands as the balloons dropped in Long Island Thursday. It was the precise tableau he craved: James is African-American, and Nixon has been pinpointing black women voters as crucial to a win. (Nixon drew criticism for suggesting African-American and Latino New Yorkers should get first dibs on marijuana dispensaries if they’re legalized as a form of “reparations.” She’s since said she’s not going to use the term anymore.) Like Nixon on the gubernatorial line, others are expected to petition to be on the Democratic ballot for attorney general, including Cuomo’s 2014 opponent, Zephyr Teachout (gaining a surprisingly robust 34 percent of the vote), and Leecia Eve, a former aide to both Clinton and Cuomo. That newly competitive attorney general’s race also works in Cuomo’s favor: it diminishes the focus on him.Nixon was never the party favorite — that’s part of her appeal. She’s been steadily picking up support from progressive groups, including Our Revolution, which formed out of Sanders’ campaign for president. But as Politico’s Edward-Isaac Dovere detailed, the group is flailing and largely ineffective. Cuomo meanwhile has $30.4 million in his campaign kitty as of the last report. There are many reasons why Nixon cannot be written off. Her campaign is run by the same professionals who helped de Blasio win the 2013 Democratic primary when he was an afterthought just weeks before winning. While this is her first run for office she has both national name recognition that ensures coverage, and a real background in New York City politics. More Cuomo gaffes are quite possible, especially if she continues to close the gap between them in the polls. And as Schneiderman’s fall shows, things can change quickly in life and in politics. Angry voters may be more motivated to vote. Then again, the September 13 primary lands on a Thursday (with Rosh Hashanah and the Sept. 11 commemoration the preceding Tuesday). With diminished turnout expected, that requires the turnout operation that Cuomo’s campaign chest and union support provide. Cuomo’s critics gripe that he’s vindictive, trying to divide progressives. “There’s an old saying in political circles, for Andrew Cuomo it’s not enough for him to win — other people have to lose — he really goes out of his way,” Bill Lipton, director of the New York State Working Families Party, told my NY1 colleague Errol Louis.If Nixon’s backers feel that angle entices New Yorkers come election day, then no one should begrudge them. And vindictiveness — if that’s what it is — may not be a healthy way to live. But when thinking about how this governor operates, I am reminded of another quote. It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both, Niccolo Machiavelli wrote. Andrew Cuomo, who has seen an election or two in his 60 years, has — for now — adroitly seized opportunities that left others stunned."},
 {'title': 'Senate Democrats Call For Multi-Agency Probe Into Russia Sanctions Delay',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Three top senators on Friday requested rare multi-agency inspector-general investigations into the Trump administration’s failure to fully implement congressionally mandated sanctions against Russia.In a letter addressed to the inspectors general of the State Department, Treasury Department and Intelligence Community, the Democratic lawmakers said the administration has not complied with the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which was passed overwhelmingly and signed into law last year in part to punish Russia for its election-meddling and its incursions into eastern Europe.“Several mandatory provisions of the law have not been implemented by the administration, despite strong evidence that actions taken by or on behalf of the Russian government are in violation of the CAATSA sanctions law and applicable executive orders codified by CAATSA,” wrote Sens. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH).The letter, which was obtained by The Daily Beast in advance of its delivery to the inspectors general, underscores the intensifying campaign that Democrats and some Republicans are undertaking to push back against the Trump administration’s policies toward Moscow and, in turn, urge the White House to be more aggressive. It also marks the latest of many claims from lawmakers that the Trump administration isn’t fully implementing the sanctions regime—and, in some cases, was keeping Congress in the dark as it missed critical deadlines mandated under the legislation.The House passed CAATSA last summer 419 to 3, and the Senate approved it by a margin of 98 to 2. President Donald Trump signed it into law despite his strong objections to provisions which he argued handicapped his authority. The Daily Beast first revealed the administration’s efforts to weaken the legislation as it was being written, so as to allow for less congressional oversight. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were successful in pushing back against an administration that they feared would be too deferential toward Russia.The legislation was written primarily to target Russia’s defense and intelligence sectors and the countries and entities that do business with them. As written, the law allows for entities that have existing financial relationships with those Russian companies—which were belatedly designated for sanctions enforcement by the State Department last year—to show that they are winding down their financial relationships with those firms and, thus, avoid U.S. sanctions.Menendez, Warner and Brown said the administration hasn’t put in the work to allow that process to unravel, which is undermining the “mandate and intent” of CAATSA.“We also remain concerned that the administration has not formally determined whether individuals are conducting significant transactions with the Russian defense and intelligence sectors under Section 231,” they wrote. “Without such determinations, it is impossible to ascertain whether individuals are substantially reducing significant transactions with these entities as outlined in the law.”The lawmakers also mentioned the Trump administration’s decision to not follow through with additional sanctions last month against Russia over its support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad—just hours after Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, announced on national television that those sanctions would be rolled out.Haley’s remarks came after the U.S. and its allies blamed the Assad regime for a horrific chemical-weapons attack in Syria. Haley said the sanctions would have targeted Russian entities that provided material support to the Assad regime. But the sanctions were nixed within hours, reportedly at the behest of Trump.It is rare for lawmakers to request a multi-agency watchdog review for the same general matter. Menendez, Warner and Brown are the top Democrats on the foreign relations, intelligence, and banking committees, respectively, and each has jurisdiction over the agencies responsible for issuing and implementing the sanctions.The inclusion of the Treasury Department’s inspector general in the letter is notable because the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is a sub-agency within the department, is responsible for enforcing U.S. sanctions against a several countries including Russia, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela. Current and former U.S. officials told The Daily Beast that OFAC is under-staffed and starving for resources at a critical time for the Trump administration’s foreign-policy objectives.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But they have also called attention to the president’s refusal to outwardly criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, his attacks on the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and what lawmakers view as an absent whole-of-government approach to counter the Kremlin."},
 {'title': '‘Heartbroken’ Trump Critic Ann Coulter: He’s a ‘Shallow, Lazy Ignoramus’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Right-wing firebrand Ann Coulter, whose 2016 campaign book In Trump We Trust touted the many virtues of the Republican nominee, is having second, third, and possibly even fourth thoughts about Donald J. Trump.“I knew he was a shallow, lazy ignoramus, and I didn’t care,” Coulter admitted to an audience largely composed of College Republicans and a few hecklers at Columbia University on Tuesday night.It was the sort of anti-Trump invective that Coulter would share privately with pals, including this reporter, over a wine-soaked dinner during the first year of the new administration, but in recent weeks she has increasingly voiced her displeasure in public forums. This time, Coulter—wearing her trademark slinky black cocktail dress, accessorized by a sparkling, handcuff-sized bracelet—repeatedly trashed her former hero during a supposed debate in Columbia’s Roone Arledge Cinema with her good friend, neoliberal blogger Mickey Kaus (modeling a plain blue suit and blue patterned tie).The ostensible focus of the conversation—moderated by Kevin Can Wait showrunner Rob Long, a rare Hollywood conservative (suitless, unshaven)—was immigration policy. It’s a topic on which Coulter and Kaus largely agree (namely, curb the flow of indigent, ill-educated, unskilled arrivals and get rid of the “illegals” who depress the wages of working-class Americans). Also on the agenda was Trump’s apparent lack of interest in fulfilling his central campaign promise to erect a “big, beautiful wall” on the U.S. border with Mexico.The debate also touched upon the opioid crisis—again, a catastrophe created by “Mexicans.” Kaus, in contrast to Coulter, argued that the United States can and should honor a long-standing tradition of admitting a reasonable number of refugees. Coulter, meanwhile, approvingly cited the strict-enforcement positions of the late Democratic congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Houston, the first African-American woman elected from the South, who argued for restricting the hiring of undocumented workers—in the national interest—when she chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration in the 1990s. Both Coulter and Kaus agreed that, in large part due to an “anti-Trump surge,” the GOP is likely to lose the House and possibly even the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections. “It kind of breaks my heart,” Coulter acknowledged of her disappointment with the president, and she recounted a profanity-laced shouting match she had with Trump in the Oval Office last year over what she saw as his lackluster follow-through on immigration policy. “He’s not giving us what he promised at every single campaign stop.”Long’s opening question to Kaus: “Mickey, if a couple of years ago you had written a book entitled In Trump We Trust, would you just feel like a total idiot right now?”“I’d be pretty disappointed. I might even be tweeting nasty things about our president,” replied Kaus, a dutiful Democrat whose vote for Trump in November 2016 was his first for a Republican presidential or any other kind of candidate. “He’s been completely feckless,” Kaus added, noting that illegal immigration from Mexico declined in the initial months of Trump’s presidency but then “started to go back up as people started to realize that Trump’s a paper tiger.”It was four nights after Coulter had aimed a bitter Twitter blast at the 45th president of the United States—who had complained last Friday, after signing the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that contained generous funding for liberal social and cultural programs favored by Democrats, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but zero dollars for his vaunted wall, that he would never do such a thing again.“Yeah, because you’ll be impeached,” Coulter had tweeted to her 1.94 million followers, one of whom is Trump. (Later during the debate, she repeated a report that the president was seriously considering vetoing the spending legislation, but after White House chief of staff John Kelly explained that such a veto would mean missing his planned weekend at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said “f--- it!” and signed the bill instead.)Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

So of course I had to be pedal-to-the-metal for Donald Trump.”“I regret nothing. I’d do the exact same thing. I’d write the exact same book, with the exact same title,” said Coulter, also the author of the racially charged 2015 anti-immigration screed ¡Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole. “We had 16 lunatics being chased by men with nets running for president—and Trump,” she continued. “So of course I had to be pedal-to-the-metal for Donald Trump. I’d been waiting 30 years for someone to say all these things”—i.e., that Mexicans streaming across the border were drug-dealers, rapists, and murderers, among other distasteful characterizations of foreign visitors to America. “I went into this completely clear-eyed.”Then she let fly with her “ignoramus” insult.Coulter, not surprisingly, was targeted by shouted epithets from one or two audience members—who had been cautioned by a university official before the proceedings got under way to behave themselves and not interrupt—when she blamed income inequality in California on rampant immigration.“We are bringing in immigrants who are good for the very rich,” she said. “They don’t live in their neighborhoods. They don’t fill up their schools or their hospital emergency rooms. And, oh boy, you should see how clean Juanita gets the bathtub. You can eat off of it after she’s done.”“You’re a racist!” a young man yelled from the cheap seats.“No, I’m sorry, the people bringing in Juanita, the maid, and underpaying her, are the racists,” Coulter shot back. “You are a moron!” she added—prompting a burst of applause. “You’re very stupid. I can’t argue with stupid people.”A half-hour later, security guys surrounded another young man after he shot up from his seat, approached the front of the auditorium where Coulter was holding forth, and began shouting: “Why are you a racist and a xenophobe?... Ann Coulter has made a career on racism! Ann Coulter has said Timothy McVeigh should have bombed the New York Times building! Ann Coulter has said all terrorists are Muslim! After what happened in Dallas, do you still believe that? After what happened in Las Vegas, do you still believe that? Ann Coulter, can you answer that? Do you still believe that all terrorists are Muslim?”“I do not remind him of his daughter!”Coulter, who by now is as calm handling hecklers as a Vegas lounge comedian, rolled her eyes and, as a phalanx of security men firmly steered her antagonist to the exit, retorted: “Look, I’ve paid you to be a plant and make liberals look stupid. You’ve done your job.” Ironically, seconds earlier, Coulter had mused that if liberal Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a tough-on-trade Democrat, would run for president in 2020, she might actually vote for him.Near the end of the evening, Long asked Coulter if her prescription for Trump’s shortcomings “is less cheerleading and more tough love.”“Tough love, yeah,” Coulter agreed.“So you are in favor of giving the president a spanking?” Long quipped—the night’s only reference, and a veiled one at that, to the Stormy Daniels situation.At which Coulter laughed and said, “I do not remind him of his daughter!”"},
 {'title': 'John Bolton to Kim Jong Un: Give Up Your Nukes Like Gaddafi Did—Before We Killed Him',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "So, President Trump’s has tapped John Bolton to be his next national security adviser.Most readers will be familiar with the broad outlines of the Bolton story – he is famously awful as a boss and his hawkish tendencies border on the absurd. A Republican senate refused to confirm his nomination, by George W. Bush, as Ambassador to the United Nations. The thought of Bolton in New York literally moved Senator George Voinovich, a Republican, to tears.Bolton has, of course, been on his very best behavior. He recently made news by appearing to support the idea of negotiations with North Korea, comparing it to the deal that the Bush Administration struck with Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi in 2003.Don’t fall for it. The agreement with Libya, and how its relates to North Korea, is actually one of the least well-understood episodes in recent diplomacy. But it is important, because it demonstrates how Bolton plies his trade, and the danger he poses.After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Bush Administration faced a delicate situation: There were no weapons of mass destruction! Saddam had, in fact, abandoned his programs and the United States had invaded Iraq anyway. This looked, well, bad. How could Bush convince other world leaders, including North Korea’s Kim Jong Il, to give up their nuclear weapons aspirations if it looked like the U.S. would just turn around and topple them, just as it had Saddam?Bush’s National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, hit on an ingenuous solution. The United States had also struck a disarmament deal with Libya. Why not have Gaddafi vouch for Bush? “North Korea will be surprised to see how much will be possible (if it abandons its nuclear programs),” she reportedly told the South Korean Foreign Minister in 2004. “I wish Kim Jong-Il would talk to Gaddafi.” Rice likely presumed the message would leak, but just to be sure Bolton—at the time, an undersecretary of state—gave a\xa0speech\xa0emphasizing that “Kim Jong Il could follow the advice of Dr. Condoleezza Rice. She was serious when she expressed several days ago her hope that Kim Jong Il would talk to Colonel Gaddafi.” A few days later, Bolton was asked whether the U.S. would “arrange a meeting between Kim Jong-Il and Colonel Gaddafi” and Bolton agreed that “it would make for an interesting conversation.”Of course, we know how that worked out. In 2011, Libyan opposition forces backed by U.S. airpower overthrew Gaddafi. It was, in fact, NATO aircraft that struck the Gaddafi convoy as it was attempting to flee Sirte, forcing Gaddafi out of his vehicle and into the hands of the rebels who brutally murdered him. As Libya collapsed into civil war, the very same John Bolton, by then a television pundit, openly advocating killing Gaddafi. Asked how this squared with his support for the 2003 disarmament deal, Bolton was nonplussed. “Nobody at the time thought it was a get-out-of-jail-free card in perpetuity,” he explained. None of this was lost on the North Koreans.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“It was fully exposed before the world that ‘Libya’s nuclear dismantlement,’ much touted by the U.S. in the past,” North Korea’s state media noted, “turned out to be a mode of aggression whereby the latter coaxed the former with such sweet words as ‘guarantee of security’ and ‘improvement of relations’ to disarm itself and then swallowed it up by force.” States pursue nuclear weapons for a lot of reasons, but chief among them is that the bomb is, in fact, a get-out-of-jail-free card in perpetuity—or at last as close to one as there is. A lot has been made of the fact that Kim Jong Un reportedly told a visiting South Korean delegation that would consider denuclearization. It’s worth looking at precisely what Kim allegedly said: “There is no reason for [North Korea] to possess nuclear weapons as long as military threats to the North are eliminated and the regime's security is\xa0guaranteed.” Kim is doing isn’t offering to give up his nuclear weapons, he’s explaining why he needs them. The notion that Kim would turn around and give up this capability for the deal that preceded Gaddafi’s grisly death is absurd. Kim Jong Un won’t denuclearize for some promises and some face time with Donald Trump. Hell, even Stormy Daniels got 130 large. So why is Bolton talking about Libya at all? His audience isn’t North Korea at all.Bolton wants to give the impression that he gave diplomacy the old college try, before moving on to the urgent task of getting us all killed in a nuclear war. Bolton is willing to entertain some period of negotiations for the sole purpose that, when they fail, he can discredit diplomacy and push for more aggressive solutions. Bolton has long admitted that this is precisely what he did in 2002, when he ultimately supported the Bush administration’s decision to send a diplomatic delegation from the Bureau of East Asia Pacific Affairs (EAP) to Pyongyang. “My first reaction [to the diplomatic overture] was dismay, but the more I thought about it, the more positive I became ….” he wrote in his memoir. “Above all, I had real faith in the North Koreans. They were what they were, and not amount of EAP spin could overcome that. … As [the diplomats] boarded their flight to Asia, EAP began to realize that perhaps this trip wasn’t such a good idea after all.”When Republican national security experts tell you how “effective” Bolton is when it comes to managing the bureaucracy, this is the kind of skull-duggery that draws their admiration. What Bolton was good at doing was appearing to support negotiations while sabotaging them, then turning their failure to his own purposes. It’s hardly bureaucratic brilliance, just a kind of low cunning unencumbered by ethical considerations. Kim Jong Un isn’t going to fall for it. Neither should we."},
 {'title': 'Did FBI Raid Michael Cohen Over Stormy Daniels?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The FBI raided the Manhattan office of President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Monday—seizing documents relating to his $130,000 payout to porn actress Stormy Daniels just days before the election. Federal prosecutors secured the search warrant with the help of special counsel Robert Mueller, The New York Times first reported Monday afternoon.The feds confiscated records relating to several subjects, though the roundup doesn’t appear to be directly related to Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling with the 2016 election, according to the Times.The seizure included emails, tax documents and business records, and communications between Trump and Cohen, the Times reported. Earlier on Monday, Daniels’ attorney filed court papers opposing Team Trump’s motion to compel arbitration after the adult actress sued to break her NDA and speak about her alleged affair with Trump. On Sunday, Daniels—born Stephanie Clifford—renewed her request to depose both Trump and Cohen in the case. For his part, Mueller has reportedly been chasing down witnesses on Cohen since at least last month. Cohen was allegedly involved in negotiations to help the Trump Organization build a tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. Cohen has also been also eyed for allegedly receiving a peace proposal for Ukraine a week after Trump took office, The Washington Post reported. Now Cohen could be investigated for allegedly making an illegal contribution to Trump’s 2016 campaign in the form of the $130,000 payout to Daniels—a possibility that was raised during the porn star’s 60 Minutes interview. Last week, Trump addressed Daniels for the first time and denied he knew of the payment. Asked why Cohen paid Daniels in the first place, Trump replied, “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.”Trump ignored a reporter who asked if he set up a fund for Cohen’s hush money.Cohen’s lawyer, Stephen M. Ryan, called the raid “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” in a statement posted on his website. The search warrants were executed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. “It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients,” Ryan said. “These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Yes, I’d Go to Trump’s Ramadan Dinner, After He Apologizes to Nearly Everybody in America',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Donald Trump, the man who declared “Islam hates us” and wanted a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims coming into America, now wants to have us, Muslims over for dinner. How mighty Trump of him. Although knowing Trump, he’ll probably serve pork chops wrapped in bacon covered in a whiskey butter sauce. In any event, Trump announced over the weekend he was having his first ever Ramadan Iftar at the White House this Wednesday. Iftar, the dinner held at sundown during Ramadan to break the all-day fast, had been become an annual tradition in the White House since the Clinton administration. Trump, however, abruptly ended that practice last year with no explanation-other than the obvious that it plays well with his base considering 65 percent of GOP primary voters supported a total Muslim ban. I’ve been a very vocal critic of all things Trump. But if he invited me to this Iftar, I would attend.  (I was one of the 14 Muslim American leaders invited to the Obama White House for a 2015 meeting.) However, before I would step into the Trump White House, Trump would have agree to one simple condition in advance: He first needs to make a very public apology directed to each and every group he has demonized or discriminated against. In fact, that would be the perfect precursor to the White House Iftar since the holy month of Ramadan is all about spiritual growth. Trump can start by telling the nation he’s sincerely sorry for publicly ridiculing a disabled reporter during the campaign. After that, Trump can show his spiritual growth by apologizing to the women of America for trying to undermine the #MeToo movement. Trump has done this numerous times, standing with the men accused of sexual misconduct and abuse, including his BFF Bill O’Reilly and his former aide Rob Porter\xa0after his two ex-wives had reported they were beaten by him.Trump also needs to offer a huge apology to the African American community for his efforts to silence NFL players trying to bring attention to the institutional racism in our criminal justice system. Trump’s disinviting of the Super Bowl winning Philadelphia Eagles to the White House on Monday\xa0is part of his efforts to silence these black athletes.\xa0 Add to that, Trump should apologize for his racist birther campaign against President Obama.Then there’s Mexicans, together with immigrants in general, who Trump has made a sport of mocking and lying about. They deserve a sincere mea culpa from Trump. Trump also needs to apologize (as well as rescind policies) directed at discriminating against the LGBT community. For example, Trump has imposed a ban on transgender Americans from serving in the U.S. military, his administration has submitted a brief to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Civil Rights Act should not protect the LGBT community and he rejected an Obama era proposed regulation that would have recognized same sex couples have “equal rights in certain Medicare and Medicaid-participating facilities.”And, of course, Trump should apologize to the Muslim American community for ginning up fears of Muslims with lies like “thousands and thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheered 9/11 and his 2016 claim that as Muslims we know “the people that are bombing the planes” but we intentionally not turning them in.Without such apologies, if I or any Muslim attended Wednesday’s Iftar, it would be normalizing Trump’s bigotry and sexism. We would also be turning our back on other minority communities who have stood with us and that we need to continue stand with against Trump’s bigoted policies and hate.And keep in mind, there were a fair number of Muslim American leaders who boycotted President Obama’s Iftar in 2014 to protest his policies such as the NSA’s then surveillance of the Muslim American community. Now personally I oppose boycotts if I think that meeting with the person in power could result in changing policy for the better. In fact, despite some calling for a boycott, I was one of the 14 Muslim Americans who met with President Obama in 2015 for an hour-long meeting in the White House to express our community’s concerns. That meeting did yield some visible results, such as Obama making his first ever visit to an American mosque in 2016. By the way, what did Trump say in response to Obama’s mosque visit? He furthered the right wing lie that Obama was a Muslim (which to the right equals “un-American”) by stating, “Maybe he [Obama] feels comfortable there… There are a lot of places he can go, and he chose a mosque.”But Trump’s attacks on Muslims go far beyond words. Trump has turned his anti-Muslim animus into policy with his attempts to impose his Muslims ban, the genesis of which was his call for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslims. And maybe worse, Trump has reduced the number of Muslim refugees allowed to enter the United State by 90 percent in fiscal year 2018. By doing so, no doubt there are some Muslim refugees now dead who would be alive today if Trump had not rejected their desperate plea to make a new life in America.

We know everything Trump does is designed for one purpose: to help himself—either politically or financially. That’s why meeting with Trump is meaningless. He can promise positive policy changes to people’s face and in front of media like he did after the Parkland high school shooting, but as usual, he did nothing.In this case, the real reason for the Iftar likely has nothing to do with the American Muslim community. Rather it’s Trump’s way to show Sunni leaders in countries he needs as allies in his fight against Iran (like Saudi Arabia) that he actually cares about Muslims.\xa0Don’t be surprised if there are no Shia American Muslim leaders at the Iftar. (Iran is approximately 95% Shia.)In all honesty, I’d prefer Trump agree to my condition. But we know that will never happen. I’m just hoping that other American Muslims don’t allow Trump to use them as props for his political ambitions while normalizing his bigotry and sexism."},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump ‘Cherishes’ Lou Dobbs So Much He Puts Him on Speakerphone for Oval Office Meetings',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It is difficult to fully understand the Trump presidency without first understanding Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business powerhouse host and one of the main precursors to Trumpism.It’s not just that President Donald Trump loves Dobbs’ show and his on-air style. It’s not just that the president asks West Wing aides and confidants if they’ve seen specific, recent segments of Dobbs’ program, or that Trump calls the cable-news personality semi-regularly to gossip or solicit counsel, or that he’s boosted Dobbs on his Twitter account. It’s not just that the president has sat for a friendly interview with Dobbs or that he is on a first-name basis with “Lou.”Indeed, much of this can describe Trump’s relationships with various other television personalities. What sets Dobbs apart is the degree to which the president views him as a political and populism godfather, the #MAGA Socrates to Trump’s Plato.As such, Dobbs doesn’t get to just interview and socialize with the president; he is involved in some of the administration’s more sensitive discussions. During the first year of the Trump era, the president has patched in Dobbs via speakerphone to multiple meetings in the Oval Office so that he could offer his two cents, according to three sources familiar with these conversations. Trump will ask Dobbs for his opinion before and after his senior aides or Cabinet members have spoken. Occasionally, he will cut off an official so the Fox Business host can jump in.Dobbs, these sources all independently recounted, has been patched in to senior-level meetings on issues such as trade and tax policy—meetings that featured officials such as senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, former top economic adviser Gary Cohn, former chief strategist Steve Bannon, trade adviser Peter Navarro, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. During the more intense days of the tax-bill push, Trump made sure to have his White House personal secretary get Dobbs on the line. And toward the conclusion of one memorable meeting, when the line was disconnected and Dobbs said farewell, Trump looked up, smiled, and simply told the room, “Love Lou.”“He cherishes Lou,” a senior White House official told The Daily Beast. And the feeling is, evidently, quite mutual.For anyone who has watched Dobbs’ transformation over the past several years, and his jump from CNN to Fox Business, it’s no mystery why he and the 45th president of the United States get along so well. Over the past decade and a half, Dobbs has transformed himself from a Wall Street ally with a skepticism of immigration into a full-on conservative nationalist-populist and culture warrior.A former colleague told The Daily Beast that before he departed CNN, Dobbs had staffers pull reels of then Fox News star Bill O’Reilly’s show. Dobbs studied the tapes and began to borrow some of the Fox anchor’s on-screen mannerisms, becoming more confrontational with guests with whom he disagreed. Another former colleague said when Dobbs began hosting a radio show in 2007, he studiously listened to successful conservative hosts like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Glenn Beck for pointers and ideas.In the intervening years, Dobbs became one of the most prominent figures in the Fox family as it has embraced Trump’s economic and immigration agenda. And he has been given the green light to pump out as much pro-Trump agitprop as possible in large part because he’s so successful. One former higher-up who still occasionally talks to Dobbs said the veteran anchor gets little direction from executives at Fox Business, who aren’t inclined to mess with his format because of the show’s strong ratings. Dobbs has been the top-rated business network host for almost two years.“Nobody with… leverage is left at Fox,” another former exec told The Daily Beast, when asked why Dobbs is allowed to serve as a booster for Trump so openly. “And if they are, they’re either looking to leave or lazy. Or they believe in the cause.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Fox Business, the White House press shop, and Dobbs did not respond to requests for comment on this story. For Dobbs, however, Trump is a revelation as much as a cause. For years, Dobbs has staked out a position for himself as one of cable news’ most strident and devoted immigrant-bashers, as well as, more recently, a staunch crusader against what he lambastes as multiculturalism’s excesses in American life—to the point where he has repeatedly attacked St. Patrick’s Day and other “ethnic holidays.” Much like the sitting president, Dobbs has also long railed against the forces of political correctness and was similarly an early mainstream promoter of racist Obama birther conspiracy theories. Also like the president, Dobbs earned himself the political backing of Trump’s one-time White House chief strategist and campaign chief. According to two sources familiar with their past discussions, in 2010 Bannon tried, but ultimately failed, to convince Dobbs to run for president as a right-wing populist firebrand.“Dobbs is pretty strong on immigration enforcement issues... so better that the president listen to him than his son-in-law or his daughter,” Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies and a leading activist for a stricter immigration system in the U.S., told The Daily Beast. “Dobbs has been talking about immigration for years. He has a certain body of knowledge that other advisers, even people working in the administration, don’t have.”Krikorian added, “Dobbs tapped into a pool of dissatisfaction [among] the public that already existed. And Trump tapped into it.”Though Trump regularly calls Dobbs to riff on immigration and other issues, some of the president’s earliest political supporters have hopes that the Fox host will play an even larger role in the second year of the administration. That is especially true for those pushing a more nativist immigration policy, who see Dobbs as potentially a useful cog in keeping Trump on his America First track.“I wish the president watched no TV, except Lou Dobbs,” Ann Coulter—a conservative columnist who has over the past year expressed her sense of betrayal at President Trump’s actions versus candidate Trump’s assurances—wrote to The Daily Beast in an email.Coulter had recently appeared on Dobbs’ show to discuss her horror at how the Trump era has played out so far. “I don’t know what happened. But that’s a different president. I haven’t changed. He has,” she insisted.Dobbs was quick to stick up for the president he informally advises and the man he has known for years. Nothing here, to Trump’s “Lou,” was President Trump’s fault, as he pushed back on Coulter’s broadside.“Affirmation complexes are never attractive and unfortunately I believe there is some truth to the fact that there are those in the White House who would like to guide him toward this liberal fantasy that is a nightmare for America and has proved to be such for our middle class, which has been dwindling for the past 20 years,” Dobbs replied. “Under this president, they’re starting to grow and money is starting to come in and we’re starting to see housing prices rise.”—with additional reporting by Andrew Kirell"},
 {'title': 'The Giuliani of 1989 Would Try to Lock Up the Giuliani of 2018',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Once upon a time, Rudy Giuliani, as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, put crooked politicians in jail. This is 30 years ago now, which is a long time, and time, well, it does things to people. In fact, Giuliani himself delivered a pretty observant remark about time Sunday on CNN, speaking to Dana Bash: “Hey, there are a lot of people with decades of service,” Giuliani said. “Some are good, some bad, and some men get consumed with power, and some begin to lie.”You can say that again, bub.Since becoming Donald Trump’s lead lawyer and defender, Giuliani has piled lie on top of lie— statements the Giuliani of the 1980s would have assembled into a devastating dossier that he would have presented with glee to a grand jury. That Giuliani of 1988—so zealous in pursuit of wrongdoing that he had a daughter wear a wire to record a conversation with her mother, a judge accused by Giuliani of a corrupt act (and acquitted!)—would have been scouring the law books looking for a way to indict the Giuliani of 2018.I’ve been writing about these people for 30 years now, and this person specifically, Giuliani, for 29—I met him in 1989. I’ve seen a lot of principles tossed out a lot of windows in these three decades, and a number of politicians who became the very thing they once ran against when they were young. But I have never seen a transformation as thorough and as chilling as Rudy’s.We were never on the same side of the ideological parking lot, and like a lot of people I objected to the gratuitous way he picked fights with political opponents who, funnily enough, were quite often black. But unlike a lot of liberals I had a grudging respect for him. New York City was a mess when he became mayor in 1994, after running and losing in 1989, and he definitely made the place more livable. For the most part, he hired serious people. Most of the time, I had decent to good relationships with a lot of them—Randy Mastro, Randy Levine, and especially his top aide Peter Powers, who was a terrific public servant and a total gentleman (putting out Rudy’s fires, he had to be).Then he started to run against Hillary for Senate. This was 1999. The mayor who had very carefully and sometimes showily distanced himself from the national GOP started to embrace it. He needed to raise millions from Republicans all over the country, so he picked some culture-war fights that were out of character or at least his character as mayor of New York City. Then he dropped out of that race after getting a prostate cancer diagnosis, and in the midst of a high profile divorce his then-wife found about from newspaper reports. . Then, after 9-11, he became America’s mayor. He deserved most of that good press, stupid placement of his bunker notwithstanding, because he did something very surprising. He expressed New Yorkers’ collective grief. You would have expected Rudy to do anger. But he did grief. It was surprising and, apparently, honest. Even an ill-conceived and executed 2008 campaign for presidential didn’t entirely dim his star.But now? Really—he wants to be out there calling men like James Clapper and John Brennan hacks? (That’s who he was speaking of in the quote to Bash above.) He’s really playing along with this ludicrous and cynical lie of Trump’s about his campaign being spied on? He’s become a complete caricature of the man he was 30 years ago. But don’t take that to mean he’s a joke. He’s not. As long as he’s out there lying for the lyingest president in the history of the country, he’s a threat to the Constitution.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The discrediting of the Mueller investigation is also a discrediting of our laws and processes and institutions. Trump has proven repeatedly that he doesn’t care about any long-term damage he does to those, as long as he wins. Hack Republicans like Florida Congressman Matt Graetz don’t care either. I still might have thought that Giuliani would care, a little, and would be more sober and circumspect in his language.But no. He’s parroting the Trump line all the way. That’s another strange thing about this, too. Giuliani was always certainly his own man. He had a coterie of “Rudy men” around him. Now, for these past two years of his life and seemingly to his last days, Giuliani appears content to be a mere bagman—for a president almost certain to go down in history as one of our worst and perhaps our most lawless.Why would he do this? Well, one reason might be that Giuliani has his own motivations for discrediting Mueller, since Mueller may well be snooping around into how Giuliani apparently knew that James Comey was going to reopen the Hillary Clinton probe in late October (read Wayne Barrett’s Beast piece from last fall for the background on this).There may be other reasons we know nothing about. But whatever such facts may be, Giuliani has succumbed to the old adage that he has become what he once beheld. In 1986, when he was putting crooked pols behind bars, he grilled Bronx Borough President Stanley Friedman on his relationships with Roy Cohn—and Donald Trump. Now, he is acting as Trump’s new Cohn. Except that there’s more at stake now than New York City Parking Violations Bureau contracts."},

  'body': "When Rep. Lou Barletta emerged as the victor in the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary on Tuesday night, it was widely observed that voters had gone with someone who was “Trump before Trump.” And for good reason. Barletta has backed some characteristically Trumpian proposals, such as his effort, as the mayor of Hazleton, to make English the town’s official language.And yet, if Barletta (1) is a proto-Trumpian politician, what does one make of his fellow Pennsylvania Republican, House candidate Rick Saccone (2), who once declared, “I was Trump before Trump was Trump.” Can two Pennsylvania Republicans both be the incarnation of the president before the president was the president? And if so, how about three? Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner (3) was declared by the Pittsburgh Tribune to be “Trump before Trump” as well. It is a testament to the degree to which Trump has taken his place at the center of the political universe that so many Republicans in Pennsylvania seems to want to adopt his image as their own. But Keystone State politicians are only the latest crop of wannabes to use the moniker. Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (4) was “Trump before Trump” when he ran last year. Rep. Claudia Tenney (5) has been deemed one herself during her re-election campaign. Current Senate candidates Chris McDaniel (6), Joe Arpaio (7), and Corey Stewart (8) have pitched themselves as “Trump before Trump.” Just-failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship (9) was described as—you guessed it— “Trump before Trump.” Before this cycle, others occupied the role of the president’s forebearer. Chris Christie (10) was called “Trump before Trump” because of his brashness (his lieutenant governor, current NJ secretary of state Kim Guadagno [11], has also earned the title). Jeff Sessions (12) was considered “Trump before Trump” because of his views on immigration. So too was former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (13).Newt Gingrich (14) was called “Trump before Trump” for….. some reason. Rudy Giuliani (15) was “Trump before Trump” because he likes media and is a Republican from New York. Sarah Palin (16) was “Trump before Trump” because she was known as a populist simpleton. Mike Huckabee (17) was “Trump before Trump was Trump” because, as he put it: “a lot of the things that he’s saying, those are things that, in many ways, I’ve been saying those for eight years.” Ted Cruz (18) was pitched to voters as “Trump before Trump was cool” while former Rep. Joe Walsh (19) insisted that people came up to him to say “Joe, you were the local Trump before Trump.”Paul LePage (20) was considered “Trump before Trump” because, well, he’s Paul LePage and yeah, the analogy works so F*&% OFF!And if you dare question why LePage should earn that title let us introduce you to former congressman Michael Grimm (21) who will “break you in half like a boy” if you challenge his one-time labelling as a “Trump before Trump.” Being un-PC, indeed, seems to be a trait that gets you dubbed a “Trump before Trump,” which may be why failed gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino (22) has also earned the title.But even some decidedly un-Trumpian Republicans have been saddled with the label. John McCain (23) and Darrell Issa (24) have all been dubbed “Trump before Trump,” the latter courtesy of former president Barack Obama. Nor is the title limited to currently serving—or even living—politicians. George H.W. Bush (25), Lyndon Johnson (26), William Jennings Bryan (27), Barry Goldwater (28), George Wallace (29), Huey Long (30), Ross Perot (31), and Pete Wilson (32) were all deemed “Trump before Trump.” The more vaunted “Trump before Trump was Trump” title was reserved for two men in particular: Pat Buchanan (33), who ran a prototype Trumpian presidential campaign, and Jesse Ventura (34), once nearly launched a presidential bid alongside Trump. Even some liberal Democrats have earned the “Trump before Trump” title, such as former Sen. Harry Reid (35).Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

And I think the big influences on him are Roy Cohn, Roger Stone, his father, [PR giant] Howard Rubenstein, Vince McMahon, Don King, and Howard Stern. But at the end of the day, it is really just him. He’s a unique guy. There is only one of him.” With such a wide-swath of influences in Trump’s life, perhaps it’s not at all surprising that prominent media personalities have also been dubbed “Trump before Trump” figures.Laura Ingraham (36) is one Fox host that has earned that title. Lou Dobbs (37) is another. Andrew Breitbart (38) was remembered on the anniversary of his death as “Trump before Trump.” And Breitbart’s protege Steve Bannon (39), who helped elect Trump during the 2016 election, was described as “Trump before Trump” for creating “the political philosophy and the political army in waiting that has been the engine for the candidate’s astonishing rise.”Even MSNBC host Chris Matthews (40) has been called “Trump before Trump” though no explanation was offered as to why.Being “Trump before Trump” isn’t a domestic phenomenon. The cliche stretches across the globe. France’s Marine Le Pen (41), Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi (42), Israel’s Bibi Netanyahu (43), India’s Narendra Modi (44), Japan’s Shinzo Abe (45), Russia’s Vladimir Zhirinovsky (46), Switzerland’s Christoph Blocher (47), Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez (48), Hungary’s Viktor Orban (49), Canada’s Stephen Harper (50), Argentina’s Carlos Menem (51), and Great Britain’s Enoch Powell (52) have all been described, at various junctures, as “Trump before Trump.”It was perhaps inevitable that the infamous late Toronto mayor Rob Ford (53) would also earn the “Trump before Trump” honorific. RIP. Tired of this list yet? In Trump-before-Trump-ian fashion, we give you MORE. How about reality TV star Jim Bob Duggar (54), Italian proto-fascist author Gabriele D’Annunzio (55), New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (56), Cincinnati sheriff Rick Jones (57), and one-time Delaware House candidate Fred Cullis (58)? All of them, Trumps before Trump.So which one of the 58 is most accurately described as a Trump precursor? “None,” says Nunberg. “It is like saying who was Tom Cruise before Tom Cruise or who was The Rock before The Rock?” Trump, he added, borrowing a quote from Roger Stone, “is a giant among pygmies.” "},

  'body': 'Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) was jubilant on 4/20. Not because he was high (he doesn’t smoke or drink) but because his colleague, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), had introduced legislation to decriminalize marijuana, marking a major milestone for pot and criminal justice reform advocates everywhere.“It’s extraordinary that he’s coming out as somebody who has not been out before,” Booker told The Daily Beast in an interview after he spoke at Reverend Al Sharpton’s National Action Network convention in New York. “I think it helps to add momentum to the end prohibition movement.”Booker has been at the forefront of the decriminalization push, making it one of his major causes as a senator. And while he sees his fellow politicians finally catching up to both him and the mood of the country, he still worries that the framing of the debate is skewed. It is not so much a matter of states rights versus federal rights, he argued, as it is one of privilege.“I get angry when you see just privileged people, wealthy people suddenly getting into the marijuana businesses and when I see people celebrating,” Booker said, seemingly referencing Friday’s date, “without the understanding that there are people suffering because of past convictions, having had their families destroyed because their wage is suppressed because they can’t get jobs because of what? They got caught for doing things that presidents have done.”“This has been a sin in a sense, the way we’ve conducted this marijuana prohibition,” Booker added. “I mean you literally have presidents admitting to doing this. You have Congress people that have now openly admitted. People of privilege have had de facto legalized marijuana for a long time. We’ve been punishing poor people, been punishing people of color and that’s got to stop.”Even prior to Schumer’s announcement, there was legislative momentum for reconsidering marijuana laws. Just yesterday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) co-sponsored Booker’s legislation which would also allow people to have their records expunged if convicted of marijuana possession. Prior to Sanders co-sponsoring the bill, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) had also backed it. Even some of his Republican colleagues, Booker noted, appeared amenable to changing marijuana laws. Among them are Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), who recently extracted a promise from President Donald Trump to respect state marijuana laws in exchange for Gardner allowing Trump nominees to the Department of Justice to get votes before the Senate.

  'body': "If Scott Pruitt’s tenure at the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency can be likened to an ecological disaster—and according to conservationists, it can—then the confirmation on Thursday of a longtime energy lobbyist to serve as Pruitt’s number-two is the Exxon Valdez. Should the scandal-plagued Pruitt be forced from his seat at the head of the EPA, newly minted deputy administrator Andrew Wheeler stands to inherit his position as head of the government agency tasked with enforcing environmental laws. In effect, Pruitt’s downfall could lead to the EPA being run by a climate-change denialist who has raked in millions in lobbying fees on behalf of polluters the EPA was created to regulate—and who in his spare time has publicly defended controversial alt-right figures by citing online conspiracy theorists.Wheeler started his career at the EPA in the nearly 1990s, drafting guidelines for the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. But his growing influence in Washington began on Capitol Hill, where he worked for more than a decade and eventually rose to become chief of staff for Senator James Inhofe (R-OK). Inhofe, who once brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to illustrate the “hysteria on global warming,” has been a vocal cheerleader of Wheeler’s nomination, declaring that “there is no one more qualified than Andrew to help Scott Pruitt restore EPA to its proper size and scope.”For most of the past decade, however, Wheeler plied his experience in environmental regulation to work on behalf of the energy and chemical industries. As a principal at Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting, his clients have included the nuclear power industry, importers of natural gas, chemical giants accused of dumping toxins in drinking water, and the nation’s largest coal mining company—all businesses that have had past entanglements with federal regulators, and likely would continue to if Wheeler became the head of the EPA.Wheeler has notably advocated on behalf of uranium mining company Energy Fuels Resources Inc., which successfully lobbied the Trump administration last year to shrink Bears Ears National Monument by more than 1.1 million acres, or 85 percent of its original size. The move, the largest reduction of federally owned lands in American history, opened the uranium-rich land up for mining. Other clients include ICOR International, a refrigerant manufacturer which hired Wheeler to lobby the EPA for weaker ozone regulations, and chemical manufacturer Celanese Corporation.But Wheeler’s largest benefactor has been coal giant Murray Energy, the largest coal company in the nation. A review of lobbying disclosures by The Daily Beast found that during his time at Faegre Baker Daniels, Wheeler became the point man for the coal mining behemoth, bringing in at least $3,324,000 in lobbying fees from Murray Energy alone. Murray Energy has sued the EPA on multiple occasions, most notably in an attempt to block the enforcement of carbon emissions restrictions.Asked how the EPA plans to ensure that Wheeler’s past work wouldn’t color his role as deputy administrator, EPA spokesperson Liz Bowman told The Daily Beast that Wheeler “has not lobbied [the] EPA, nor any new EPA issues since President Trump was elected,” noting that Wheeler deregistered as lobbyist in August 2017, shortly before his nomination.“Mr. Wheeler consults with EPA career ethics officials, and will ensure that he is recuses himself from any potential conflicts,” Bowman said.While Wheeler may not have lobbied the EPA, however, he did attend a March 2017 meeting between Energy Secretary Rick Perry and the chief executive officer of his largest benefactor at Faegre Baker Daniels: Robert Murray, of Murray Energy. During that meeting, Murray provided Perry with a proposal that would provide special government subsidies to coal and nuclear power plants—and gave the secretary a controversial bear hug.Wheeler’s record has terrified conservationists, particularly after Pruitt’s escalating ethics scandals have put his future as administrator in jeopardy.“The mission of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment, but Andrew Wheeler has dedicated his career to weakening environmental protections, serving as a lobbyist for numerous fossil fuel clients, including one of our country’s biggest polluters, Murray Energy,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, in an open letter to the Senate ahead of Wheeler’s confirmation. “Wheeler’s inherent conflicts of interest from his long history of ties to the fossil fuel industry make him an entirely inappropriate choice for EPA’s number two leadership role.”Wheeler did not respond to a request from The Daily Beast to discuss his work with Faegre Baker Daniels, but Bowman did direct The Daily Beast to the Office of Government Ethics, which has published a letter from Wheeler to the agency’s career ethics official in which he vows to abide by his ethical commitments.

But Wheeler hasn’t always been a fan of Trump: In a six-point February 2016 Facebook post, Wheeler told his followers that Trump was a “bully” who “doesn’t understand how the government works.”Only seven months later, however, Wheeler had swung hard in the direction of some of Trump’s most fervent fans. In August 2016, Wheeler publicly defended alt-right troll Milo Yiannopolous after the latter was banned from Twitter for encouraging users to harass actress Leslie Jones. In a now-deleted tweet, the lobbyist linked to a six-minute video, “The Truth About Milo,” produced by InfoWars editor-at-large and noted conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson, in which Watson posited that conservatives might be “banned from using the internet altogether if they trigger your butthurt.”Pruitt, for his part, has welcomed Wheeler into the fold at EPA with open arms.“Andrew Wheeler has spent his entire career advancing sound environmental policies and I look forward to him bringing his expertise and leadership to the agency,” Pruitt said in a statement upon Wheeler’s confirmation. “I look forward to working with Andrew to implement President Trump’s environmental agenda.”"},
 {'title': 'White House Aide’s Plan to Stop Leaks: Spy on His Co-Workers',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A former National Security Council official now slated to work for Attorney General Jeff Sessions explored ways to surreptitiously monitor the communications of White House staff for leaks or perceived political disloyalty to Donald Trump, according to three former Trump NSC officials familiar with the effort. Ezra Cohen-Watnick, whom former national security adviser Michael Flynn brought onto the NSC as senior director for intelligence, sought technical solutions in early 2017 for collecting and analyzing phone and other data on White House colleagues for interactions with reporters. He portrayed his desired leak hunt as an “insider threat” detection effort, according to the ex-officials. Those who heard of it presumed it would focus on NSC staffers held over from the Obama administration. It is unknown whether Cohen-Watnick’s efforts actually resulted in any monitoring program. The former officials noted the overwhelming technical and legal hurdles to doing so. One called it “wholly inappropriate” for Cohen-Watnick, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, to do anything of the sort, considering it a blatant attempt at intimidating his colleagues. Another, who agreed the proposed effort was inappropriate, likened it to a “Keystone Cop thing.” “This seemed designed to intimidate rather than protect national security,” said a different ex-NSC official familiar with the proposal. “This seemed designed to intimidate rather than protect national security.”— former NSC officialSome staffers considered Cohen-Watnick’s insider-threat focus ironic, considering that Cohen-Watnick himself reportedly played a role in a Trump White House effort to leak intelligence reports to Devin Nunes, the House intelligence committee chairman. Nunes then subsequently used the reports in a failed attempt to reinforce Trump’s baseless accusation that Barack Obama had placed his camp under surveillance. Cohen-Watnick’s attorney, Mark Zaid, has denied Cohen-Watnick’s involvement in the March 2017 “unmasking” Nunes episode.In a statement to The Daily Beast, Zaid said that Cohen-Watnick was involved in discussions about implementing a Barack Obama-era insider threat program, but denied that it either came to fruition or that discussions of it sprawled beyond protecting classified information.“Ezra worked along with numerous others within the NSC and IC [intelligence community] to facilitate implementation of the Obama Executive Order on insider threats that was issued in the wake of Edward Snowden’s illegal theft and disclosures,” said Zaid, who also represents The Daily Beast, and this reporter specifically, in Freedom-of-Information-Act litigation. “At no time was Ezra undertaking any activities to use the program, which remained under development when he left the NSC, to in any manner unintended by the Obama administration. Any unfavorable insinuations to the contrary are coming from cowardly anonymous individuals who have a personal ax to grind.”Cohen-Watnick is now re-emerging from a post-White House stint at\xa0the software behemoth Oracle\xa0to take a senior advisory role to Sessions, ostensibly about counterintelligence and counterterrorism. After this piece was initially published, Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told the Daily Beast that Cohen-Watnick isn’t a current department employee, something Zaid attributed to “routine employment processing.” Flores would not clarify if Cohen-Watnick would soon be a department employee or if he has not, as reported, been hired.All this is happening right as the White House is once again\xa0obsessed with leaks\xa0and angry at the Justice Department for the Russia probe. Yet practically\xa0every major administration figure,\xa0including Trump\xa0himself, is being accused of leaking.That’s caused Cohen-Watnick’s former colleagues, who spoke on condition of anonymity, to recall the insider-threat episode out of suspicion that his new role is to be a political commissar, ensuring Sessions toes the party line desired by a president who distrusts his attorney general. Unlike previous national-security aides to attorneys general, Cohen-Watnick is not a lawyer, and the Justice Department, for more than a decade, has a formal national-security division working on such issues.“I used to refer to him as the one most likely to end up like Ollie North,” said a former Trump NSC official, referring to the Marine officer and Reagan administration official central to the Iran-Contra scandal who turned a policy laboratory in the White House into an unauthorized operational agency.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The Daily Beast’s sources consider Cohen-Watnick’s communications-interception scheme to be an outgrowth of his focus on loyalty to Trump and desire to pressure career staff sent to the NSC from outside government agencies before Trump’s election. Such staffers were considered with the derisive term “Obama loyalists,” even though most were civil servants, not political appointees. Cohen-Watnick, in his early thirties, was a DIA analyst who caught the eye of the agency’s then-director: Mike Flynn, the three-star Army general who went on to become Trump’s premiere military surrogate on the campaign and then first national security adviser. Flynn took Cohen-Watnick as a senior staffer on the powerful council, where Cohen-Watnick held the senior directorship for intelligence, making him a supremely influential liaison between the intelligence agencies and the White House. There, he was known as a premiere “Flynnstone,” as Flynn’s adherents were derisively called. The term typically referred to the blend of paranoia, ignorance, and blustering contempt for disagreement that Flynn personified, as well as an apparent appetite for war with Iran.Flynn imploded less than a month into the administration—and later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI—but Cohen-Watnick remained at the NSC. He survived until August, despite Flynn’s successor, Lt. General H.R. McMaster, attempting to fire him. Attorney Zaid has also denied that Cohen-Watnick got fired ahead of decamping for Oracle. At the outset of the administration, one ex-NSC official recalled, “they were up in arms over leaks,” even though the former official suspected many of those leaks came from the Trump faithful themselves. “The officials said Cohen-Watnick used to hold what one ex-official described as ‘loud secret meetings,’ in earshot of passers-by, about finding leakers.”Even the terminology Cohen-Watnick and his allies employed, these officials said, spoke to the hysteria around leaks. “Insider-threat detection” most often refers to officials who leak classified information—like Cohen-Watnick is alleged to have done with Nunes. The Pentagon got spun up about setting up programs like that after Chelsea Manning’s mass disclosures of classified information on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The hunt to detect so-called insider threats grew even more intense after Edward Snowden’s appearance on the scene. But none of the ex-officials saw Cohen-Watnick distinguishing between classified information leaking and stories appearing in the press that made the Trump team look bad, dumb, or deceitful. One recalled Cohen-Watnick expressing particular concern around the time that Trump’s disastrous January 2017 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto leaked the following month. Another recalled becoming aware of it after an unclassified draft executive order authorizing new CIA black-site detentions leaked to The New York Times.The officials said Cohen-Watnick used to hold what one ex-official described as “loud secret meetings,” in earshot of passers-by, about finding leakers. A recent New Yorker story on the NSC under the now-ousted McMaster referred to “rumors” spreading inside the White House that “administration officials had established an ‘insider threat’ program at the NSC, and were trying to root out disloyal staffers.” While there was a sense of paranoia early on in the Trump administration from the constant infighting and hostility to non-loyalists in the bureaucracy, few who talked for this story considered Cohen-Watnick’s idea more than fanciful. The technical and legal challenges were—and are—substantial. While privacy expectations over work-phone call logs or emails sent from government accounts or transiting government networks are limited—and ex-NSC officials recalled having to consent to some monitoring of those work devices and accounts upon employment—privacy laws and whistleblower protections apply to government employees who aren’t discussing classified information with journalists, particularly over their personal devices and accounts. The National Security Council is not an operational agency, let alone a law-enforcement agency—one of the central aspects of the Iran-Contra scandal. It isn’t one of the entities authorized to order or perform communications intercepts under the Wiretap Act. As well, laws like the Electronic Communications Privacy Act have “color of law” provisions preventing communications providers from turning over subscriber information to unauthorized entities. “Like with ‘unmasking’ and the Nunes memo, this sounds like some of the [Trump administration’s] haphazard schemes that aren’t well thought through and aren’t going to result in anything meaningful,” said Jake Laperruque, a senior counsel on surveillance issues at the Project on Government Oversight. “For a government agency, the notion of clamping down on any public insight for non-classified information, where there is no breach of the law, is somewhat disturbing.”“I used to refer to [Cohen-Watnick] as the one most likely to end up like Ollie North.”— former NSC officialFrom a technical perspective, the project would likely require outside vendors, so as to avoid tasking the FBI or intelligence agencies with effectively spying on the NSC, and would rapidly create a problem on where to securely store NSC staffer communications data, which would include highly sensitive and inevitably classified material. It would also have represented a substantial management challenge at a time when the NSC was filled with top-level turmoil. Former NSC officials found themselves at a loss to figure out how Cohen-Watnick expected his desired monitoring to actually work. Accordingly, none of the sources who discussed this episode with The Daily Beast were confident that Cohen-Watnick would ever have succeeded in launching an insider-threat program. They considered it instead a misguided effort at intimidation. The Daily Beast has no evidence to indicate any of this actually happened, something Zaid’s statement on behalf of Cohen-Watnick bolsters. “It’s hard to believe this had any chance of coming to fruition, in terms of authorities and actually obtaining and storing data,” said a former Trump NSC staffer. “This seemed more of a knee-jerk retaliation driven by frustration than any serious effort to address a real threat.” Julian Sanchez, a surveillance expert at the Cato Institute, speculated that the most viable path to Cohen-Watnick achieving his initiative would be to “order every employee to ‘consent’ to the disclosure of their records by their telecom carrier.” Even then, however, it would be a legally dubious proposition, since it would effectively force NSC staffers to open their non-work phone and email accounts to the government as a condition of employment.

 {'title': 'Nicolle Wallace: Hannity Runs Trump ‘Like an Asset’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "“With Trump installed as communications director, it only makes sense Fox News personality Sean Hannity is the de facto chief of staff,” Nicolle Wallace said Wednesday afternoon on MSNBC.That was the former White House communications director for President George W. Bush’s big takeaway from a new Washington Post story that reports Hannity is “one of the few people who gets patched immediately to Trump” when he calls and “basically has a desk in the place.” “It's all making sense,” she said of the revelation this week that Trump and Hannity share a lot more than just an attorney. Adding her own reporting, Wallace said that Hannity “plays a big role in personnel decisions,” advocating for figures like Anthony Scaramucci and John Bolton.More than once during the segment Wallace questioned the narrative that Fox News is “state-run TV,” saying, “We should be staring more closely at the White House and saying ‘Fox-run state.’” When one of her guests, Donny Deutsch, suggested that the symbiotic relationship between Trump and Hannity is “somewhat harmless” because it’s so “transparent,” Wallace pushed back. “Here's what I think is dangerous,” she said. “The Nunes memo was a huge ratings boon for Fox.” She explained that Trump’s “hand-picked” FBI director Christopher Wray went to House Speaker Paul Ryan and said, “Please for the love of god don't release the Nunes memo. It's incomplete, it’s inaccurate, it brings into question once of the most sacred processes we have, the secret FISA court.” “This is why I think we get this wrong,” Wallace continued. “Fox isn't state-run media. The state is run by Fox. Sean Hannity needed that story and I think he ran the president like an asset the way people are wondering if the Russians are running the president.” Hannity not only “fueled” the story, she said, but he also “gave the president encouragement to overrule his brand-new FBI director Christopher Wray.” "},

  'body': "In his seminal 1922 book, Public Opinion, journalistic pioneer Walter Lippmann coined the phrase “manufacturing consent,” describing how the Woodrow Wilson administration, for whom he served as part adviser, part raconteur, “was trying, and while the war continued it very largely succeeded… in creating something that might almost be called one public opinion all over America.” Lippmann cited the work of George Creel, a fellow journalist who became chairman of Wilson’s Committee on Public Information, and whose successful use of propaganda included pro-war speeches placed in periodicals, classrooms, newspaper ads and cartoons, placards in store windows and more. “Think of the dogged work,” Lippmann wrote, “the complicated ingenuity, the money and the personnel that were required. Nothing like that exists in time of peace, and as a corollary there are whole sections, there are vast groups, ghettoes, enclaves and classes that hear only vaguely about much that is going on.”Sixty-six years later in their 1988 book borrowing Lippman’s famous phrase, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky lamented the ways in which even without government coercion, the media too often shapes public opinion in ways that coincide with the interests of those with political and economic power, mainly by self-censoring and relying on sources with incentives to maintain the status quo. The book was written at the close of the Reagan administration, fourteen years after Lippmann’s death and 27 years after President Dwight Eisenhower warned of the rise of a military-industrial complex bent on perpetual war, in his farewell address to the nation in 1961.By the time Chomsky and Herman’s book was published, Americans had added to the experience of World War I the righteous intervention in World War II (coupled with the villainous internment of more than 100,000 Japanese Americans), the conflict in Korea (1950-53), the war in Vietnam (1961-73), a failed military invention to free U.S. hostages in Iran (1980), the disastrous loss of 241 marines in a truck bomb attack in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 followed days later by the invasion of Grenada, and a raid on Tripoli, Libya (1986). By the following year, 27,000 American troops were invading Panama, a year before Reagan’s successor, George H.W. Bush launched the first Persian Gulf War. Subsequent presidents would initiate military action in Somalia (1992), Haiti (1994), Bosnia (1995), Kosovo (1999), Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). President Obama sent U.S. troops to participate in the NATO coalition that helped overthrow Muammar Qaddafi in 2011 (an intervention he would later say spawned his worst mistake: underestimating the viciousness of the aftermath) though he was denied authorization after going to Congress for lawful clearance to strike Syria two years later, after the dictator Bashar al-Assad used sarin gas to put down a rebellion against his regime at the bitter end of the Arab Spring. And of course, Obama dispatched Navy Seals to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. Over time, manufacturing consent through wartime intervention has become more challenging for U.S. presidents. Lyndon Johnson lost control of the narrative of Vietnam when Walter Cronkite and other journalists exposed the truth that overrode the government’s storyline. Carter was undone by the narrative of failure in Iran. Reagan faced deep skepticism over the swift U.S. exit from Lebanon after the Beirut massacre and the near simultaneous entry into Granada, plus the near presidency-ending Iran-Contra scandal. And Clinton was accused in heavily freighted media reports, of “wagging the dog” by dropping bombs on targets in Sudan linked to Bin Laden, as the Monica Lewinsky scandal spiraled. There’s no reason to believe that Donald Trump knows any of this. He is famously averse to reading and there’s no evidence he has spent any time as president studying history. But he does understand the media, being a creature of it himself. And he surely intuits the degree to which military action can yet have the effect of uniting the country behind a president, including by focusing the media on the components and execution of the mission, rather than on questioning its propriety. That was especially true after 9/11, when the Bush administration’s march to war in Iraq after a swift sidetrack from Afghanistan went virtually unchallenged by an enthralled American press.Ironically, Trump rallied his base during the 2016 election in large part around the notion that the powers that be weren’t skeptical enough about the intelligence that presaged the U.S. invasion in Iraq. It’s one of his chief talking points against the intelligence community he seems to so deeply revile for its insistence on questioning the nature of his relationship with Putin’s Russia. And Trump was a vocal opponent of a strike against Syria in 2013, with the tweets to prove it. Clearly, Trump has the ability to quickly discard these ironies. He also has the performer’s muscle memory to recall how he was praised by members of the press and by a bi-partisan chorus in Congress, including Republicans who, like him, had opposed the very same intervention by Obama, after authorizing a bombing raid against Syria for a chemical weapons attack that killed children in August 2017. This despite Trump’s boasting about the blithe manner in which the authorization took place, at Mar-a-Lago with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, over chocolate cake. Months before, Trump addressed a joint session of Congress after having shunted responsibility for the death of a Navy SEAL in a disastrous Yemen raid onto the military brass, and was lauded as having “become president” in the moment of his address merely for pointing out the dead SEAL’s widow in the congressional gallery.The lesson that Trump surely has taken from his 448 days (and counting) in office, including from the wistful hopes draped at various stages onto the barred shoulders of his chief of staff John Kelly, his defense secretary James Mattis and his recently sacked national security adviser H.R. McMaster, is that the path to public praise tends to run through “his” generals. Trump’s military strike on Syria came on an especially fraught day for his administration. On Friday, we learned from NBC News that deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Robert Mueller investigation, is bracing himself to be fired; from CNN that FBI agents seized recordings between Trump's longtime fixer Michael Cohen and the lawyer who represented two of the women who have claimed to have had sexual relationships with the real estate mogul-turned-president: porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal; and from McClatchy that Mueller is in possession of evidence confirming a crucial piece of the Christopher Steele dossier—that Michael Cohen did indeed travel to Prague in the summer of 2016, despite insisting to the media and to congressional investigators that he wasn't there. Trump has never been under more pressure, with multiple investigations of himself and his cronies under way. He remains deeply unpopular. And the FBI director he fired, James Comey, has reportedly already moved 200,000 copies of his best-selling book that eviscerates Trump’s character, likening him to a mob boss. We cannot know if Trump sought to shield himself against the metastasizing cancer engulfing his White House by shifting the country’s theater of imagination to Syria, absent some telling statement from the president himself. But the question hangs in the atmosphere. It will surely lurk in the margins of discourse among our friends and our enemies around the world, shrouding the exercise in Syria in deep cynicism, even in the face of Assad’s extravagant evil.After all, Trump is the same American president who slammed the door on Syrian and other refugees. Just weeks before Friday’s bombing, he was reportedly demanding a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria before being talked out of it by his national security team. The narrative of Trump’s rise to political power was about putting “America first” and curtailing non-European immigration and multilateral trade, not the military adventurism he has adopted as president, including bringing war fetishist Bolton, a man with no personal military experience, into his cabinet. There has been no authorization to use military force issued by Congress since the AUMF after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. And there is that spiraling investigation that threatens Trump’s very tenure in the White House.

Bush style. So maybe this goes no further. But if it does, and it becomes apparent that the president of the United States is using military action to remake his presidency, we should all hope for sober but firm skepticism from the public, the media and our elected representatives (though who are we kidding when it comes to the current Congress), to keep the war dog’s tail from wagging.

 {'title': 'Megachurches Are Turning Into MAGA-Churches',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "About a month ago, The New York Times ran a much-discussed story, “A Quiet Exodus: Why Black Worshipers Are Leaving White Evangelical Churches.” The piece detailed how formerly interracial megachurches were becoming MAGA-churches, with Donald Trump’s presidency being the source of the exodus. Black worshippers who left the comfort and familiarity of the black church to forge an inclusive, integrated church with their white neighbors now find themselves church-less. The support of Trump’s divisive rhetoric within their predominantly white churches made their continued attendance untenable. Many of these African Americans now randomly select a new church each week in the hope of finding a new spiritual home.While it is true that black parishioners are leaving white churches in droves, Trump isn’t the cause. He merely exacerbates a festering wound that white evangelicals have for years proven themselves incapable of healing, despite their attempts to convince us of the opposite. Growing up in the suburbs of Atlanta, I constantly heard the refrain, “11 o’clock on Sunday morning is one of the more segregated hours in Christian America.” Martin Luther King Jr. said this phrase on Meet the Press in 1960, but the reality he described continued for many years thereafter. Segregation may have officially ended in the 1960s, but across the South, whites and blacks still lived largely separate lives. And the few African Americans who lived in predominately white environments still mostly attended black churches. Church, and the barbershop, remained one of the few places where the black community could congregate.King did not aspire to have a segregated church, and he welcomed white parishioners to Ebenezer Baptist Church. Likewise, as racial progress expanded in the South, despite the growing influence of the religious right, many African Americans aspired to break the South’s segregated status quo. The racial progress of Bill Clinton’s presidency emboldened many African Americans to leave the comfort of the black church and actively seek out churches with a racially mixed congregation. My mother was one of those people.“For my mother, my sister, and me, the fissure began during the Monica Lewinsky controversy, as our minister began injecting conservative politics more and more into his sermons.”For the majority of my youth I attended an integrated church. It wasn’t a megachurch, but it had about 700 parishioners, and it was about 50-50 black and white. The sermons were fine, and it would be unfair to label any of the white church goers or ministers, and leaders of the church as racist. They wanted an integrated church as much as we did, but around the time I left for college in the early noughties my mother’s commitment to the church began to wane, and now she attends a predominantly black church.For my mother, my sister, and me, the fissure began during the Monica Lewinsky controversy, as our minister began injecting conservative politics more and more into his sermons. He’d denounce Bill Clinton at almost every opportunity, and he seemed entirely unaware that the black members of his church were so firmly in Clinton’s corner that some considered him “America’s first black president,” in Toni Morrison’s phrase.We honestly did not care that our minister was a conservative. Almost every white person around us was a Republican, and we found ways to get along. He based his distaste of Clinton on moral and political justifications, but not race. Yet his analysis, religious teachings, and idea of morality clearly did not incorporate the perspectives, experiences, and opinions of the black community or his black parishioners.His inability to adequately incorporate black life into his sermons made all of us feel unwanted. He was neither malicious nor racist, and his inadequacy with considering and understanding race was just a logical byproduct of living in a religiously and culturally segregated society. As African Americans in a predominantly white community, we did not have that problem. We constantly thought about the experiences of our white neighbors as we searched for common ground in attempts to be neighborly and build a strong, diverse community inside and outside the church.Throughout the South, the cultural onus has always been on African Americans to adopt white ideals with little to no expectation of reciprocity. This inequality influences every aspect of society, including the church.

Every Sunday, we’d quietly hope and pray that he would stop telling us to vote for George W. Bush because Bush was supposedly a good Christian as he lambasted Clinton and Al Gore: Gore was guilty by association. Soon thereafter my family and many of the other black families also left the church.This same dynamic is happening today with white evangelicals and the African Americans who attend their churches. The progress of Barack Obama facilitated this push toward integration. And Trump’s racially divisive rhetoric and outreach to the evangelical community has inclined ministers to both discuss politics in the pulpit and espouse beliefs that run counter to their black members’. The moral authority of white evangelicals has disappeared in the eyes of black and countless other Americans.The harsh reality of today’s black evangelical exodus, and the smaller but similar one from 20 years ago, is that white Southern society has always intended for churches to be segregated, and progress makes this racially oppressive status quo abundantly clear. White evangelicals have thrived in a vacuum devoid of black parishioners, and until recently, they took extraordinary measures to ensure that their churches remained segregated. Throughout Southern history whites forcefully prevented blacks from worshipping alongside them. The few pre-Civil War “integrated” churches required blacks to sit in the back. And during Reconstruction, when blacks demanded representation or the opportunity to preach from the pulpit in these “integrated” churches, the white members either left or forced out the black worshippers. This forced segregation remained the norm until the 1960s.My dad grew up in Alabama during Jim Crow and the civil rights era, so he’s seen the Ku Klux Klan and everyday whites terrorize black church goers, and he grew up in a segregated worshipping environment. For him Saturday—when you get your haircut at the barbershop for church—and Sunday were the two greatest refuges from white oppression, when he and his friends could relax and worship without the threat of white terror.Not surprisingly, African Americans would spend the entire day at the barbershop or church to seek sanctuary. My dad has always attended a predominantly black church and still spends most of Sunday at his church.Honestly, the convenience of a shorter sermon at an integrated church as we attempted to build bridges with our white neighbors appealed to my mother, my sister, and me until the futility of that endeavor became clear.Today’s exodus doesn’t show only how divisive Trump has made our society, but instead, how divided it has always been."},
 {'title': 'FBI Texts: ‘Catastrophuck’ Trump Nearly Drove Agents to Quit',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Forty-nine new pages of text messages between two FBI agents who investigated potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin were turned over to Congress on Thursday. The exchanges—once thought to have been lost in an FBI-wide glitch—further reveal the antipathy both agents felt toward the newly elected president, as well as the dread they felt following his firing of the FBI director.The tranche of messages exchanged between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, provided to Congress and reviewed by The Daily Beast, were sent between Dec. 16, 2016, and May 23, 2017—the period including President Donald Trump’s inauguration, his firing of FBI Director James Comey, and the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the investigation into Russian election interference.The texts paint a portrait of two beleaguered federal employees who were equal parts anguished by and aghast at Trump’s election, torn between “our strong but flawed organization” and a “catastrophuck” president.“I kept telling myself the organization is much bigger and stronger than any one person, that we’ll endure,” Strzok texted Page four days after Comey’s unceremonious firing. “But that didn’t seem to help.”The messages were originally thought to be deleted, casualties of a glitch impacting roughly 10 percent of FBI cellular devices. They were later recovered, however, with the use of forensic tools by the Justice Department’s inspector general, who is currently heading up an investigation into the FBI’s investigations into both Clinton’s emails and Russian interference in the election.Both Strzok, the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division, and Page, a fellow FBI employee with whom he was romantically involved, were removed from Mueller’s team after the special counsel was informed of these and other messages between the two that criticized Trump. Some Republicans have pointed to the exchanges as evidence that Mueller’s team is irreparably biased against the president, who told The Wall Street Journal in January that Strzok had committed a “treasonous act” by suggesting before the election that the FBI aggressively investigate allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin.“This is the FBI we’re talking about—that is treason,” Trump said at the time. “That is a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.”While the newly revealed text messages further show the personal contempt in which Strzok and Page held Trump, they do not provide any apparent evidence that the duo was part of a “secret society” conspiring to undermine the president—as Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) first suggested upon the release of the first batch of text messages in February.In their exchanges—in which Page called Trump an “idiot” and “a douche,” among other insults—Strzok and Page had also criticized liberals, including Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Eric Holder, and Bernie Sanders. Former colleagues have denied that Strzok was biased in his official role on the Mueller team, and Strzok had also told Page at one point that “my gut sense and concern is there’s no big there there.”That “gut sense” did not prevent the pair from venting about the president, particularly in the early days of his administration, when they exchanged a music playlist of songs from nations whose citizens had been banned from entering the United States and mocked the president’s early-morning Twitter rants.“You see the tweet about the Seattle judge?” Strzok texted on Feb. 5, one day after Trump called into question the legitimacy of a federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban by calling him a “so-called judge.”By mid-May, the morning of a Trump tweetstorm in which he called the investigation into potential collusion “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!” neither agent could muster more than shock.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Wow wow wow,” Page texted that morning. “Sad for me, even Bob Mueller can’t stop the 4:20 wakeups.”“How far we’ve gone...” Page texted on Feb. 27, linking to a New York Times article noting former President George W. Bush’s criticism of Trump’s nascent presidency. “Yeah we’re pretty much a catastrophuck right now,” Strzok responded, quoting a source in another Times article who said of Trump that the Russians “think he is unstable, that he can be manipulated.”Investigations into the Trump campaign’s potential links to Russian intelligence were a frequent topic of conversation between the two agents, even in the early days of the Trump administration. Less than a week after Trump’s inauguration, Page texted Strzok an ominous “It begins…” linking to a Times article titled “Russian Charged with Treason Worked in Office Linked to Election Hacking.”The pair’s hostility to Trump—and apparent frustration with their work at the FBI—peaked in the aftermath of Comey’s firing.“We need to lock in [redacted],” Page texted Strzok at 5:29 a.m. on May 10, the morning after Comey’s firing was announced. “In a formal chargeable way. Soon.”“I agree,” Strzok replied. “I’ve been pushing.”Later that day, a press briefing in which then-deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Comey had committed “atrocities” during his time at the FBI prompted another outburst of incredulity.“Are you watching this sh*t?!??” Strzok texted. “Huckabee said [Comey] had ‘lost confidence of rank and file of fbi’.”Strzok and Page’s deeply held frustrations—evident throughout the 49 pages of texts reviewed by The Daily Beast—crested the week of Comey’s firing.“Lisa, don’t think for a second that you’re not extraordinarily excellent at what you do,” Strzok texted Page in a pep talk the day before Comey’s firing. “Don’t doubt yourself. You’re awesome. And don’t quit. I get the impulse, I’m there with you, but don’t quit. Need you in the foxhole.”“F the foxhole,” Page replied. “I’m done with the greater good. It’s not worth this.”After Comey’s departure, the mood between Strzok and Page became even more grim.“Having a tough time processing tomight [sic], Lis,” Strzok texted Page at nearly midnight that Saturday. “Feeling a profound sense of loss.”“I feel that same loss,” Page replied. “I want to see what the FBI could become under him! His vision of greatness for our strong but flawed organization. I’m angry. Angry and mourning.”“We will endure,” Page continued, “we just won’t be as good.”"},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "California was supposed to be a state of immense electoral opportunity for Democrats in 2018. But as pivotal congressional primaries approach, it now risks becoming the staging ground of a political nightmare, having already forced the party to funnel millions of dollars in varying directions and with differing purposes.That’s because California has a top-two primary system, in which the two leading primary vote getters move on to the general election regardless of their party affiliation. With crowded Democratic fields in key districts—including those Hillary Clinton won in 2016—that may result in no party candidate moving on to the next round of voting at all.Faced with this calamity, gamesmanship has prospered. National Democrats are targeting second-tier Republicans. Local Democrats are targeting each other. Other Democrats are trying to prop up specific Democrats. And now national Republicans are trying to both target leading Democrats and bolster second tier Republicans. Confused? It’s fine to be. Let’s try and clear things up a bit. California’s 48th DistrictRep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) holds the Orange County seat, which includes Huntington Beach. But he is being challenged by both Democrats and Republicans. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has backed real estate executive Harley Rouda and recently launched a $400,000 joint TV ad buy to help him. The committee’s ad spending has totalled nearly $1.7 million according to FEC filings. But not all of it is pro-Rouda content. The DCCC has also focused some of its attacks on knocking down Republican candidate Scott Baugh, a previous member of the California State Assembly. Baugh is also being hit with negative ads from Priorities USA and House Majority PAC, with the purpose to deny him a second place finish.Rouda, alas, isn’t loved by all Democrats. While he is being aided by the DCCC he is also taking on fire from his left with the pro-science progressive group 314 Action targeting him in an ad. The spot, obtained by The Daily Beast, references an age discrimination case against Rouda’s company from a decade ago. The group is running those spots on behalf of their preferred Democratic candidate, neuroscientist Hans Kierstead.Complicating things a bit further is that Baugh, while not the incumbent, is now getting some tangential support from the GOP establishment. Recently, the National Republican Congressional Committee has jumped in to the race, plotting a six-figure buy to turn out Trump voters in 48th district as well as two others. The beneficiary of the expenditure is, ostensibly, both Republican candidates. California’s 39th DistrictDemocrats are marginally less concerned about this district, which includes parts of Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties and is represented by retiring Republican Rep. Ed Royce. But with six Democrats and seven Republicans running to replace him, it’s still become a bit of a money pit. The DCCC has spent almost $2 million here, a great percentage of which is against two Republican candidates: Shawn Nelson and Bob Huff. They had previously added Navy veteran Gil Cisneros to their “Red to Blue” program, which provides additional resources to Democratic candidates, even as Cisneros was getting into a nasty primary fight with fellow Democrat Andy Thorburn. In April, Cisneros’ campaign threatened legal action against The Intercept for publishing a voicemail the campaign alleged he didn’t actually make. The story and Thorburn alleged that in a message left on Thorburn’s home phone, Cisneros said he was going to engage in a sharply negative campaign. It remains unclear who left the message. Following a brokered agreement from the state party to avoid negative campaigning, the DCCC made another $285,000 investment for Cisneros including a Spanish language ad. The NRCC’s digital get-out-the-vote campaign is running here too.California’s 49th DistrictGet The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Four Democrats are duking it out to advance to the general election in November, including Doug Applegate, who previously lost to Issa in 2016 by less than one percent. But the the DCCC is not spending on behalf of Applegate—who had been accused of abusing his ex-wife, a claim she says is false—or any of the Democrats for that matter. Rather, the committee is targeting the Republicans in the race; specifically, state assemblyman Rocky Chavez, who has been hit with more than $480,000 in negative spending in the last week and half alone. Chavez has recently polled as the top vote-getter with Applegate in second place. Close behind them were Democrat Mike Levin and Republican Diane Harkey. But not all Democratic groups are staying out of their party’s primary. Sara Jacobs, the only woman running on the Democratic side, has received around $1.6 million in ads and mail campaigns over the last month from the Super PAC arm of Emily’s List. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics estimates that it is the fourth most expensive House district race in the country based on outside spending. California’s 45th DistrictThere is nowhere near as much outside spending going on this Orange County district represented by Rep. Mimi Walters (R-CA). But a proxy fight is emerging in the Democratic primary. Professor Katie Porter, who studied under Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at Harvard Law School, is being backed by the Emily’s List PAC. Additionally, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee launched a final-week ad campaign on Facebook, Instagram and Google targeting one of Porter’s opponents, Dave Min. The buy cost the group $20,000 and could increase pending on online fundraising, a spokesperson for the group said. While the battle here is exclusively on the Democratic side, with Walters facing no Republican challengers, it is another district where the Democratic party is feeling bullish. A recent poll, commissioned by the progressive End Citizens United group, found Porter narrowly leading Walters in a prospective general election matchup."},
 {'title': 'A ‘Suicide’ Mission: White House and GOP Leadership Fear New Obamacare Repeal Push',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Persistent chatter that congressional Republicans will take another swing at repealing and replacing Obamacare this summer has increasingly drawn the ire of leadership and the White House, where there is virtually no desire to walk down that legislative path again. Numerous White House officials scoffed at the prospect of an actual Obamacare-repeal revival, saying they can’t fathom depleting political capital on a project with virtually no chance of passage this close to the midterm elections. One West Wing official called it a “suicide” mission. A senior administration official said the issue wasn’t being taken seriously inside the building because the president’s team has concluded “the votes aren’t there.”With Trump and his aides eager to avoid revisiting one of their biggest legislative humiliations, the likelihood of Obamacare repeal and replace actually getting another hearing is incredibly remote. But that hasn’t stopped some in the party from fretting that the issue remains a political tripwire. In leadership circles, there is an emerging fear that those floating the idea of taking another whack at Obamacare repeal and replace are setting up a lose-lose situation in which GOP lawmakers look either feckless for ducking the issue or impotent for again failing to successfully pass it. “All these people out there not responsible for elected real-life senators don’t seem to realize there are consequences for failed votes,” said one top Senate GOP aide. “We experienced them last summer. I don’t understand why we would want to have that again.”Or, as one top Democratic aide put it: “I can’t believe they would be so stupid. That said, they often surprise me with how stupid they are.” For an Obamacare repeal-and-replace effort to actually have a chance at passage, a number of unlikely hurdles would have to be cleared. The first would be for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to introduce a budget that included instructions for a health-care overhaul to be considered by a simple majority vote. Then, McConnell would have to convince all other 49 voting Republicans (Sen. John McCain has been at home battling brain cancer) to back that budget, a tall task as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) traditionally votes against such measures.At that point, the party would need to introduce an Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill. The prevailing theory is that the legislation introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) would be the most likely vehicle. But McConnell would have to somehow persuade the same GOP senators who voted against all prior efforts—namely Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski—to drop their opposition, on top of convincing those lawmakers from Medicaid expansion states that a bill that switches to a per-capita cap on funding for the program is worth supporting. And he’d have to do this all while assuming the House will follow suit—a proposition based on a similarly shaky foundation. “I didn’t hear anybody seriously talking about Obamacare,” one House GOP lawmaker told The Daily Beast of chatter in that chamber. “They have their panties in a bunch right now on immigration and, secondarily, on the [spending cuts] package.”With no cover from the administration and little-to-no assistance from GOP leadership, those hoping to revive Obamacare repeal and replace have adopted a ground-up approach.In April, a group of conservatives put together guidance for another bid to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. The effort was and is being spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation and entails meetings with health-policy analysts to generate a consensus plan that would make it to the president’s desk. Those involved acknowledge the heavy lift, but the hope is that activists might pressure lawmakers to move before they potentially suffer losses in the midterm elections. “There’s growing recognition that the current system is not meeting the intended goals,” Naomi Lopez Bauman, director of Healthcare Policy at the Goldwater Institute, told The Daily Beast. “We know there are obstacles, but this is such an important issue that there’s also recognition that the status quo is not going to get better.”The Goldwater Institute, along with everyone from former Sen. Rick Santorum to Grover Norquist, have signed on to consult on the plan. In broad strokes, it would allow for money to be provided to states in the form of block grants that would replace Obamacare’s payments to private insurers.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The hope was to formally introduce a bill by mid-June. But as spring turns to summer, and no plan has materialized, some lawmakers are left to publicly encourage the party to put a final end to the notion that Obamacare will ever be fully wiped from the books.“We’ve got to give up on repeal and replace,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said at a town-hall meeting in Iowa last week. But for some directly involved with the plan, it’s vitally important to at least try to get something accomplished, precisely because, as it stands, Democrats are using Republican inaction on health care as an electoral cudgel. “We need to have a plan that we can talk about as we go through the elections,” one source working on the initiative, requesting to speak on background, told The Daily Beast. “What it’s going to take is a political imperative to act. Republicans thought it was an existential crisis if they didn’t get tax reform done.”Norquist also sees the prospect as a boon for Republicans’ electoral fortunes. “Why not add another feather in your hat in addition to the tax cut?” Norquist told The Daily Beast. “I think people should be ready for it because it may happen. I think it would be a huge political winner.”Inside the White House, the tactic being adopted is decidedly less optimistic. Rather than re-tackle the longstanding GOP promise to nuke the Affordable Care Act, Trump has been determined to declare that the mission of repeal and replace has already been accomplished.“We had Repeal & Replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway,” the president tweeted Monday morning, in a clear dig at McCain for his vote against repeal. “Individual Mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. Drug prices coming down & Right to Try!”The tweet continued the president’s spin that the 2017 tax bill’s repeal of the individual mandate (perhaps the least popular aspect of Obamacare) was tantamount to a form of ACA repeal. One source who’s been close to Trump for years referred to this play as a “coping mechanism” and said that in private conversations, the president has been repeatedly and emphatically critical of McCain for his vote, wondering if the Republican senator did mainly to spite Trump. “‘Blame John McCain, then pivot to how great it is that the [individual mandate] is taken care of,’ is the president’s messaging strategy for this. Shift blame, show a win,” a senior Trump aide told The Daily Beast."},
 {'title': 'Trump Chaos Is Turning Pennsylvania’s Purple Districts Blue',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In 2016, Pennsylvania was key to President Donald Trump’s victory. But in 2018, the state is shaping up to be ground zero for a likely Democratic wave.The newly redrawn congressional map, which nixes some GOP-gerrymandered districts, is Republicans’ chief concern and completely out of their control. But the size of that Democratic wave will depend on whether voters in suburban areas, many of them Democrats who supported Trump in 2016, are wary of giving Republicans another mandate to govern.The suburbs of major Pennsylvania cities like Philadelphia were trending Democratic even before Trump came onto the political scene. But as moderate Republicans are having an increasingly difficult time navigating Trump’s takeover of the GOP, many of the same suburban voters who propelled Trump to the White House have turned against Republicans in recent special congressional elections—namely in Pennsylvania’s 18th district, where Democrat Conor Lamb defeated Republican Rick Saccone in a district that Trump won by 20 points in 2016.Perhaps more problematic for the GOP, the party is continuing to lose the advantage of incumbency in districts that lean left. Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA) became the latest Republican to announce his retirement last week, leaving his party to defend his suburban Philadelphia seat in a year when Democrats need to flip at least two dozen seats nationwide to give the speaker’s gavel back to Nancy Pelosi. The Cook Political Report on Tuesday moved Costello’s district from a “toss-up” to “likely Democratic.”In an interview, Costello warned that the 2018 elections represent—in particular for those who did not vote in 2016—the “first chance to protest” against the unified Republican government under the leadership of the president. That anger will be directed toward elected Republicans, he said, regardless of whether those lawmakers view Trump favorably.“There’s going to be a group of voters who voted for the president that may not be pleased with job performance or view him favorably, and this will be their opportunity to consider voting against him—and they do that by voting against their Republican member of Congress,” Costello told The Daily Beast. “That’s not even a working hypothesis anymore. That’s reality.”Those Republicans who have already called it quits are putting the blame squarely on Trump, and are warning of large-scale buyers’ remorse among the same Pennsylvanians who backed the president in 2016.“Suburban Republicans are at much greater risk under this presidency. It’s not just in the suburbs of Philadelphia but in the suburbs of New Jersey and in Minnesota, Colorado, California, Florida and elsewhere … more traditionally suburban districts are clearly more vulnerable in this political environment,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), a moderate Republican who announced last year that he wouldn’t be seeking re-election to his Allentown-area seat, said in an interview.While Costello cited the fact that his new congressional district makes it nearly impossible for any Republican to win there, in an interview on MSNBC he hinted that many of the same suburban voters who went for Trump aren’t prepared to reward the GOP with another win this time around.“There’s no question that it was going to be tough in light of what’s happening in the suburbs across the country,” Costello said. “In my district … the local Democrats and the left has become more engaged and, candidly, more angry by the week as President Trump says things and does things which many Republicans, myself amongst them, from time to time do disagree with.”The chaos surrounding the Trump White House 14 months into his presidency is presenting real problems for elected Republicans. Costello said he and his colleagues are routinely put into a bind whenever they want to condemn the president’s actions or words—risking drawing the ire of Trump’s base while at the same time taking heat from newly energized Democrats for not going far enough to distance himself from Trump. All the while, he added, Republicans are being forced to weigh in on the president’s alleged marital misdeeds, high-profile White House staff shake-ups, and other negative stories.“We’re talking about porn stars and the president rather than tax policy or what we need to get done by the end of the year,” Costello said, referring to porn star Stormy Daniels’ allegations of an affair with Trump.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But this year, moderate Republicans who out-performed Clinton in their own districts are choosing to retire rather than risk becoming a political casualty at the hands of Trump.Costello was re-elected in 2016 by 14 points even though Clinton won his district by one point. Clinton won Costello’s new district, under the congressional map ordered by the state’s supreme court, by 10 points. In other words, Costello was in trouble regardless of what’s happening on the national political stage.“The reason that Democrats have done as well as they have in Pennsylvania in statewide elections, despite the fact that Republicans hold the legislature and the congressional delegation … is largely because the Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley suburbs have been trending Democratic,” Terry Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College, told The Daily Beast.“The reason Trump won is he engaged the rural and small-town voters, many of them Democratic in the northeast and southwest in the old mining and and mill town parts of the state,” Madonna said.Complicating matters further, it all comes at a time when Republicans on Capitol Hill are openly disagreeing about how to craft a November strategy that minimizes the expected damage to their congressional majorities.Conservatives argue that the best way to counteract the groundswell of opposition against Trump, in the form of a massive Democratic wave, is to double down on the base—that is, keeping pushing conservatives legislative agenda items in order to give the GOP base a reason to vote in November.“The people of this country came out by the millions to support Donald Trump, support his agenda and the policies that he’s pushing forward. And he has been delivering day in and day out on that front,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday. “I think the people that voted for and came out and supported him still do so.”But moderates like Dent and Costello have said that playing to the base will further embolden Democratic opposition to Trump, leaving suburban Republicans in a difficult bind as they try to appeal to the same Democrats who voted for Clinton.“That doesn’t mean Republicans in suburban districts can’t win. It just means that it’s a very catch-22 type of conundrum that we find ourselves in,” Costello said on MSNBC on Tuesday. “... I’ve lived through it for the last year and a half.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Has No Plan to Counterpunch Michael Avenatti',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Michael Avenatti, the pitbull lawyer representing the porn star alleged to have had an affair with President Donald Trump, is currently the hardest working man in show business—but it’s still unclear who exactly is paying for his frenetic services.In particular, reporters were inquiring as to whether political opponents of the president—and not merely said porn star, Stormy Daniels, and sympathetic donors—were footing the bill.Avenatti emphatically denied that any “political party or PAC” was “funding this effort.” And, as mostly happens these days, the news cycle moved on. But the fact that he was only then being asked those questions exposed something totally out of place about the Trump-world scandal du jour. For weeks, Avenatti has been a thorn in the president’s side. In seemingly endless and continuous string of cable news hits, he has called into question the veracity of Trump’s insistence that there was no affair with Daniels. He has pursued legal challenges to a nondisclosure agreement between Daniels and the president’s top fixer, Michael Cohen. He has vexed the president’s own legal team, getting them to haphazardly admit that Trump knew about hush money payments. And he has exposed a secretive network of finances that allowed Cohen to both pay off Daniels (and, potentially, other women) as well as recruit business for a shadow-lobbying operation during the Trump administration.Avenatti has done it all with little, if any, coordinated pushback from the president or his allies. Inside the White House, aides say that anything related to the Stormy Daniels-Michael Cohen saga is purview of outside counsel. At the Republican National Committee, sources say, there is no rapid-response-like operation designed to counter-balance Avenatti’s numerous media appearances. Conservative outlets allied with the president have covered the drama but they have largely avoided doing the type of oppositional digging that they have undertaken on other real and perceived Trump foes. And Republican strategists seem unclear as to whether anyone is gearing up an operation any time soon.“No one seems to understand why the RNC, America Rising and other GOP groups aren’t doing even basic political blocking and tackling with Avenatti,” said on GOP operative. “He’s essentially gotten a free pass from them.”It is, in many respects, the most unexpected of plot lines: a president who regales in throwing counterpunches simply choosing to not throw one at all. In the past, Trump has taken delight in going after his legal foes, including judges and even women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual harassment or assault. And when it’s not him, his aides and allied institutions have picked up the slack. For former FBI Director James Comey, the RNC took the lead in rapid response during the Higher Loyalty media blitz.But with respect to Avenatti, Trump—famous for his hate-tweeting and his penchant for punching down—has remained conspicuously silent—even on his Twitter feed.It’s not because he doesn’t have any thoughts on the matter. According to two sources close to the president, Trump has privately branded Avenatti a wannabe bigshot and a “loser.” A White House official noted that Trump has explained his decision to not go after Avenatti publicly because he deems him a “total loser” not worthy of Trump’s acknowledgement, whether on Twitter, in public statements, or in response to shouted questions from the White House press corps. It is, in other words, strategic non-engagement. And though it’s not like Trump to bite his tongue, other strategists on the Republican side say it is the smart move to make; if only because any alternative would only elevate Avenatti further.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“It’s a sideshow,” said Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush’s former press secretary, who has questioned Avenatti’s motives but, he noted, only when asked on TV. “And the fact that [the Cohen-Stormy case] is being investigated in the Southern District of New York and not by [special counsel Robert] Mueller underscores that it is a sideshow.” “I can see why the Trump White House wants to concentrate its fire where the fire matters most,” Fleischer added. “And that’s with Mueller.” For Avenatti, however, the absence of pushback from Trumpland is not indicative of a well-thought out game plan but, rather, of the absence of a gameplan at all. “Strategy? They have a strategy? I thought their approach was centered on tic tac toe,” he said to The Daily Beast. The pugnacious, telegenic lawyer insisted that Trump and his senior staffers are spooked by him. He claims to have heard “from multiple people” that “the White House is prohibiting people close to the president from going on camera with me on any show,” and that he has even been told by TV bookers West Wing officials have “pulled the plug” on media appearances when they’ve caught wind that Avenatti would be on the same segment. Avenatti noted that his tweets trying to bait Fox News host Sean Hannity—one of President Trump’s closest outside advisers and loyalists—into granting him an on-air interview have not yet been successful.“Never happened. We don’t get into that,” White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said, however, when asked about Avenatti’s claims. “We don’t get into his media.”Whether the White House can sustain that distance from “his media” is both a matter of impulse control for the president and political pressure for the administration. Just this week, Avenatti dropped a bombshell (major parts of which were corroborated by news outlets, including The Daily Beast) on how Cohen had moved to massively profit off of his relationship with the president. This included revelations that Cohen received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a company connected to Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch reportedly questioned by federal agents working with special counsel Robert Mueller.The revelations subverted a news cycle that was poised to be dominated by generally positive news for the president, including the release of prisoners held in North Korea. Rudy Giuliani, another Trump attorney, went as far as to accuse Avenatti of timing his release to coincide with the Trump administration pulling out of the Iran deal, saying, “Avenatti saw this coming and wants to stink it up as much as possible.”By Friday morning, another negative Avenatti story had surfaced, this time on Fox News, with a focus on his past business dealings.“No question that they are trying to do a hatchet job on me because they can’t deal with the facts and evidence in the case,” Avenatti alleged."},

  'body': "The Trump administration says it has reached a deal to send an unnamed U.S. citizen it has held without charge in military detention for the past seven months to another country, according to court papers—something the man’s attorneys are fanning out to stop. Should the unnamed citizen, whose detention was first reported by The Daily Beast in September, be sent abroad, it would short-circuit a potential landmark case defining the scope of the Trump administration’s detention powers. It’s also a case, national security lawyers have pointed out, with the prospect of declaring the entire U.S. war against the so-called Islamic State illegal. The U.S. citizen’s name remains a secret, but he is also, according to an earlier Justice Department filing, a citizen of Saudi Arabia. The court papers do not name the country that the government intends to send the citizen. Since September, the U.S. military has detained him in a facility in Iraq.In January, the government confirmed to the federal judge hearing his so-called habeas corpus case—a challenge to his detention without charge—that it intended to send him abroad, rather than risk losing the habeas case. “Releasing [the man] from U.S. custody into the custody of another country with a legitimate interest in him is one of the options under consideration,” it wrote, urging Judge Tanya Chutkan not to “foreclose” an option challenged by the man’s attorneys. In late January, Chutkan, opting for a middle ground, instructed the administration to give 72 hours’ notice of a transfer. The government appealed to a federal circuit court the following month, and a three-judge panel heard the appeal on April 5. But before any ruling, the government on Tuesday filed a heavily redacted notice informing all sides of its intent to go ahead with a transfer in the required 72-hour window. Its argument, delivered by an unnamed senior State Department official, is that Chutkan would damage U.S. diplomacy by preventing the transfer. “It is vital diplomatically that the United States is able to follow through promptly on its commitment,” the diplomat wrote in a Monday declaration filed in court. “A temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction prohibiting or delaying [redacted] would undermine the United States’ credibility with an important foreign partner that has agreed to this request… The Department of State must have the ability to make reliable representations and commitments when engaging directly with [redacted] on a matter of such sensitivity,” the diplomat argued, adding that additional legal delays “could adversely affect [the country’s] willingness to engage with the United States on some future detainee transfers.” Since President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. has conducted no detainee transfers. Guantanamo Bay holds the same 41 detainees it had on Barack Obama’s final day in office. The unnamed U.S. citizen “is challenging his transfer to the country under consideration presently,” confirmed Brett Max Kaufman of the American Civil Liberties Union, one of his attorneys. “The Trump administration has been detaining this American citizen unlawfully for more than seven months, and forcibly rendering him to another country would be an unconscionable violation of his constitutional rights,” said Jonathan Hafetz, the lead ACLU attorney on the case. “The government has no legal authority to detain this U.S. citizen in the first place, and it clearly lacks any legal authority to transfer him to the custody of another government. He should either be charged or freed, not handed over to an unnamed foreign government.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Chutkan has yet to rule on the merits of the detention. At issue is the government’s claim that its war-making powers against ISIS extend to detaining the unnamed citizen, who surrendered to U.S.-allied proxy forces in Syria. But the government’s legal authorities for that war stem from two authorizations to use military force (AUMF) that long predate the existence of ISIS: the 2001 AUMF to avenge the 9/11 attacks; and even the 2002 AUMF for the invasion of Iraq.Should Chutkan rule against the government, she would likely end up saying that the lack of its detention authority indicates that the AUMFs in question do not sufficiently authorize the war against ISIS. Some senators this week unveiled a new AUMF that would explicitly authorize that war. Chutkan announced that she will hold a hearing on Thursday morning in D.C. on the potential transfer. It might portend a resolution to the first major detention case of the Trump era—without resolving its central questions. "},
 {'title': 'Watch the GOP Freak Out Over This Muslim Candidate',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It was just a few months ago that a GOP activist in Minnesota introduced a resolution calling on the Republican Party there to “minimize and eliminate the influence of Islam.” The resolution contained the typical BS talking points idiots on the right spew, such as Muslims want to destroy America. (Tell that to the 5,000 plus American Muslims currently serving in the U.S. armed services and the families of those Muslims buried in Arlington National Cemetery.) The resolution even seeks to ban Muslim leaders, religious or otherwise, from ever delivering a speech or invocation at a Republican convention or event. Now before you dismiss this as the rantings of a madman, think again. The Minnesota state GOP chair, Jennifer Carnahan, refused to denounce the resolution when asked about it by the local media because she “did not want to prematurely judge the situation.” And even her statement responding to the resolution seemed to be dog whistle politics saying that the Minnesota GOP welcomes anyone “who shares our values.” Add to that, two GOP Minnesota legislators claimed in January that Muslims were trying to “infiltrate” the Republican Party and one of the current GOP candidates for governor, Phillip Parrish, recently refused to even meet with Minnesota Muslim community leaders saying that “Islam is not a faith.” I think you get the idea: the Minnesota GOP—just like the Republican party’s national leader Donald Trump—demonize Muslims in the hopes it attracts votes. That’s why it’s truly inspiring that one of the three leading Democratic candidate for Minnesota governor, Rebecca Otto, announced on Monday that her running mate as lieutenant governor would be Muslim American Zarina Baber. If the Otto/Baber ticket wins, Baber will make history as the first Muslim woman in U.S. history ever to hold statewide office.Just the thought of the Minnesota GOP anti-Muslim bigots freaking out over a Muslim lieutenant governor brings me an inappropriate amount of joy. But Baber is not just a Muslim; she holds many of the traits that Trump has lashed out against. She’s also an immigrant (from India), a woman, and brown. Baber is a quadruple threat to Trump and many in his base.“Estimates are that Muslims make up over 200,000 of Minnesota’s five million residents. And in the past few years the community has become far more politically engaged.”Baber, though, was not chosen simply because of her faith. She has truly earned her place on the all-female ticket with Otto, the current Minnesota state auditor who first won statewide election to this position in 2007 and has since been reelected to that post twice. Baber began her political activism decades ago by volunteering on the campaign of the late progressive icon, Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone. For the past 25 years, Baber has worked as an information technology professional and a health care advocate. She established a free health clinic that has been operating for over 20 years, sits on the board of the nonprofit Advocates for Human Rights and is a founding member of the National Democratic Muslim caucus. When does she sleep?!In announcing Baber as her running mate Monday, Otto explained that Baber’s background is perfect to help tackle one of the top issues she is campaigning on: Implementing a single-payer healthcare system in the North Star state.But there’s clearly another reason why Otto chose Baber. In Minnesota, the Muslim community is growing in political strength. Estimates are that Muslims make up over 200,000 of Minnesota’s five million residents. And in the past few years the community has become far more politically engaged, much of it in response to the type of the anti-Muslim hate that Minnesota’s GOP and Trump have spewed. There has been an effort for years to organize the Minnesota Muslim community, after all the first Muslim American to ever be elected to the U.S. Congress is Keith Ellison who hails from the state. And I’ve personally been to Minnesota various times in the past for events where Muslim leaders urged members of the community to register to vote. But it was the open bigotry of Trump together with his Muslim ban that made it clear to all in the Muslim community that the stakes were too high to simply sit by idly. That’s why in the midst of Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016, various Muslim organizations united in Minnesota to launch an “unprecedented mobilization effort” to not only register Muslim American to vote, but to encourage them to get involved in politics and even run for office. And in November 2016, history was made with the election of Ihlan Omar to the Minnesota state legislature, the first Somalia Muslim refugee to ever be elected to that position in the United States.That’s why when Baber was announced as Otto’s running mate you saw her flanked by Muslims on stage. And while Baber doesn’t wear a hijab (the simple head covering), another Muslim woman on stage standing directly behind Baber during the announcement by Otto was. That might not seem like a big deal, but back in 2008 then candidate Barack Obama’s presidential campaign staff removed two women wearing hijabs from standing directly behind Obama during a rally because they apparently had concerns about them being featured in press photos. (An Obama campaign spokesperson apologized later that day for the incident.)What we are seeing in Minnesota with the Muslims community is simply the story of America on display. Minority groups that have been demonized in the past to score political points—be they Black, Jewish, LGBT, Latino, etc.—have found that engaging in politics can be an effective way to push back against the hate. It makes politicians aware that there are political benefits to appealing to these minority communities. And in turn, it sends a message to the politicians spewing hate that they will suffer electorally.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'body': 'Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) is calling on the Treasury Department to prioritize the release of the Harriet Tubman $20 bill in a letter she sent Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday.The letter comes after The Daily Beast reported that the schedule for redesigns of the $20, $10, and $5 bill to feature civil rights and women’s icons has not been finalized under the Trump administration. Shaheen asked Mnuchin if the Department of the Treasury plans to release the new notes by 2020, the 100th anniversary of the amendment that gave women the right to vote and the tentative redesign release date announced by the Obama administration in 2016. “This recognition is long overdue. Women have been a critical part of our nation’s history and values, and the lack of a woman on our American currency is glaring oversight,” Shaheen wrote. In 2016, the Treasury Department announced plans to place Tubman’s likeness on the $20 bill, replacing President Andrew Jackson who would move to the back. The back of $10 bill will nod to leaders of women’s suffrage like Sojourner Truth and Susan B. Anthony, while the back of the $5 bill will feature civil rights leaders like Marian Anderson.According to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the $10 bill will be the next note set for recirculation in 2026. The rollouts for new bills could be delayed even further due to anti-counterfeiting efforts; the $20 bill is the most counterfeited U.S. bill, according to Reuters. \xa0'},
 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Says His Lobbyist Landlord’s Clients Didn’t Have Business Before the EPA. They Did.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As he doggedly tries to save his job amid a mounting ethics scandal, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has insisted that there was no formal or informal conflict of interest when he rented a room from high-profile Washington D.C lobbyist, J. Steven Hart. “Mr. Hart,” Pruitt claimed in an recent interview with Fox News on Wednesday, “has no clients who have business before this agency.”A review of lobbying disclosure forms and publicly-listed EPA records, however, suggests that Pruitt is either lying or is woefully unfamiliar with the operations of his own agency. Far from being removed from any EPA-related interests, Hart was personally representing a natural gas company, an airline giant, and a major manufacturer that had business before the agency at the time he was also renting out a room to Pruitt. One of his clients is currently battling the EPA in court over an order to pay more than $100 million in environmental cleanup costs.The New York Times previously reported that Hart’s firm, Williams & Jensen, represented a company that got a pipeline expansion project approved by the EPA. But that only scratches the surface of Hart’s deep involvement in the energy industry—and advocacy on behalf of clients with business before the agency that his one-time tenant leads.Hart himself was part of a team of four Williams & Jensen lobbyists that has reported lobbying Pruitt’s EPA. They did so on behalf of Owens-Illinois, a glass bottle manufacturer that paid $39 million in 2012 to settle EPA allegations of widespread Clean Air Act violations by a subsidiary. In June 2017, while Pruitt lived at Hart’s DC condo, another of the company’s subsidiaries settled additional EPA allegations that it violated the same law.“We know that Steven Hart’s firm had clients before the EPA,” said Craig Holman, Government Affairs Lobbyist for the good-government group Public Citizen. “So his insistence that there is no conflict of interest is just off the wall.” Even clients of Hart’s who didn’t enlist him to lobby the EPA directly had at least tangential business before the agency. Among them is industrial equipment manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker, which is currently in litigation with the EPA over its own environmental liabilities. In 2014, the EPA ordered the company to pay $104 million in cleanup costs at a superfund site in Rhode Island. Black & Decker disputed the ruling, but estimated in its most recent annual shareholder report, it expects that it may eventually have to pay between $68 million and $140 million in remediation costs at the site. The case is currently working its way through federal court, an EPA official confirmed to The Daily Beast. And Pruitt himself has directly weighed in on the matter, elevating the superfund site as a target for immediate and intense attention.Hart’s other clients include Cheniere Energy, which as Fox’s Ed Henry noted operates liquified natural gas terminals on the Gulf Coast and is reportedly one of the best positioned companies for Pruitt’s American gas export campaign. “Steve has never represented them,” Pruitt insisted to Henry. In fact, lobbying disclosure records show that Hart has personally represented Cheniere since Williams & Jensen signed the company as a client in 2004.In a separate interview with The Daily Signal, the news arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, Pruitt claimed that “[Hart’s] firm represents these [energy industry] clients, not him. There has been no connection whatsoever in that regard.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In fact, Hart represents numerous firms in the energy space, in addition to Cheniere. Black & Decker subsidiary Stanley Oil and Gas “provides world-class pipeline services and equipment in more than 100 countries, offshore and onshore,” according to its website. Another Hart client, Smithfield Foods, manufactures energy through the use of animal waste collected at its hog production facilities. Hart’s lobbying on behalf of the company routinely includes advocacy on energy policy issues.Other Hart clients have had business before the EPA on either ceremonial or non-energy related matters. Hart represents the Coca-Cola Company, which has landfill and bottling operations that have fallen under the EPA’s purview. Hart represents United Airlines, which is involved in an aircraft drinking rule program for which the EPA—while Pruitt was staying at Hart’s condo—issued self-inspection requirements. And until December 31 of last year, Hart represented the American Automotive Policy Council, a trade group formed by Chrysler, Ford Motor Company and General Motors; automakers that have numerous policy interests the overlap with the chief environmental protection agency in America. A request for comment to Hart was not returned seeking clarity as to what, if anything, he did to advance his clients interests before the EPA. In some cases, however, it is clear that his clients fared poorly. This past week, for example, Pruitt announced that he would be rolling back Obama-era car emissions standards, a policy that both Ford and GM have been vocal about not supporting, as one plugged-in Hill source explained. The EPA did not return a request for comment. "},
 {'title': 'Stormy Daniels Spanked Donald Trump With TRUMP Magazine—and a Picture of His Own Face',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Nobody was ever spanked with a more appropriate object than the one Stormy Daniels recalls employing on Donald Trump. “He’s like, ‘have you seen my new magazine?’ Daniels recounted to Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes of her encounter with Trump in 2006.Some have suggested that the magazine was Forbes. But the timeline doesn't add up. The spanking took place in July 2006 and the Forbes magazine with Trump on the cover came out in September 2006, with a dateline of October 2006.The only new magazine that Trump would have called his own at that time was the premiere issue of TRUMP magazine. It had just been produced under a licensing agreement with Trump in the way of other properties to which he lent his name and spoke of as if they were his, in this instance all the more so because he was a major shareholder in the publishing company.He was, of course, on the cover.“He was showing you his own picture on the cover of a magazine,” Cooper remarked to Daniels. “Right, right,” Daniels said. “And so I was like, “Does this-- does this normally work for you?’ And he looked very taken-- taken back, like, he didn’t really understand what I was saying. Like, I was, ‘Does, just, you know, talking about yourself normally work?’ And I was like, ‘Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.’”Daniels laughed at the memory. She continued, “And I’ll never forget the look on his face. He was like-- I don’t think anyone's ever spoken to him like that, especially, you know, a young woman who looked like me. And I said, you know, ‘Give me that,’ and I just remember him going, ‘You wouldn’t.’ ‘Hand it over.’ And-- so he did, and I was like, ‘turn around, drop ’em.’ So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little-- you know had underwear on and stuff and I just gave him a couple swats.”Along with Trump’s photo, the magazine’s cover was emblazoned with the words ON TOP OF THE WORLD. Another cover line read:“BUBBLE? WHAT BUBBLE? Real Estate Tips From Trump U.”What made it the perfect paddle to be used on such a supreme con man was that TRUMP magazine led investors to lose their savings in three distinct ways.One way was by investing in the company that published it.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The ebullient elder Trump was slated to get a six-figure annual license few as well as 16 percent of the stock. The New York Post knew nothing of the elder Trump’s tryst with Daniels and was just being clever when it when it asked what name he would adopt if he went into porn.“Big,” Trump said, then offering a second choice: “The Trump Tower.”The hype, along with an insistent sales force making cold calls a la “The Wolf of Wall Street” convinced investors as far away as Holland to put in sums as big as six figures. Most of them appear to have lost whatever they invested.A second way to lose money through Trump magazine was to follow the tips from Trump University touted by the cover line and detailed by the accompanying article. The magazine relayed reassurances from Trump that that there was no real estate bubble. And, even if there were, and even if it burst, he would welcome it because he could go in and make a lot of money.“At the launch party for the mag that Stormy would later spank him with, Donald was asked what his porn name would be. ‘Big,’ he said,  or ‘The Trump Tower.’”A bubble bigger than anybody imagined did in fact burst two years later, nearly wiping out Trump himself, not to mention investors who followed his advice. The global economy almost collapsed. The third way to lose money through Trump magazine was to be persuaded by the article not just to follow bum tips from Trump University, but also to enroll as a student and begin paying excessive fees for instruction of little value. Trump University was a passionately for profit, ostensibly educational enterprise. Ronald Schnackenberg, its sales manager in 2006, would describe it, as “a fraudulent scheme” that “preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money.”Trump University’s victims would subsequently sue and receive a $25 million settlement in restitution for the tuition and other fees they were hustled into paying. Nothing at all has gone to investors who lost by either investing in the magazine itself or by following the advice offered by its pages.One person who almost did make money as a result of TRUMP magazine was a publishing executive named Mitchell Schultz. He suggested that an animated cartoon series called Trump Takeover would be a good way to promote the magazine and might even become a hit on its own. The episodes he proposed included one in which the hero SuperTrump becomes the President of the United States.“And saves America,” the episode summary reports.Tramp liked the idea and entered into a licensing agreement with Schultz, who received 300,000 shares in Premiere Publishing. The stock briefly topped a dollar and it seemed Schultz might actually profit from his efforts. The one hitch was he proved unable to sell it.“I was running around trying,” he told The Daily Beast. “I said, ‘I’ll give you half price.’ I couldn’t do it. Nobody would bite.”He wistfully added, “Everybody lost money.”In recent days, Schultz became aware that Stephen Colbert and Showtime were coming out with an animated series called “Our Cartoon President.”Schultz still had a licensing agreement with Trump for a cartoon series and he has been consulting with an entertainment lawyer to see if he has ground for legal action against Colbert.Unlike with Stormy Daniels, Trump actually signed the agreement with Schultz.“He did,” Schultz told The Daily Beast. “We have a written agreement.”Schultz reported that since his publishing days he embarked on a new career in a fledgling industry that has a future, however distant.“I’m a certified space tourism specialist,” he told The Daily Beast. Meanwhile, Schultz has maintained a SuperTrump website and blog, along with a bitcoin endeavor called SuperTrump’s CryptoMANIA Investment Club. He sometimes calls himself Mr. SuperTrump. He allows that he was amazed when the hero of his proposed cartoon went on to become president in real life.“Can you believe that, right?” Schultz said.And now that surreal reality has been joined by Stormy Daniels’ revelation that she spanked the future president with a copy of TRUMP magazine, the most perfect of paddles.“I got a kick out of that one,” Schultz said."},
 {'title': 'Trump Hits ‘Fever Pitch’ About Finally Firing Rosenstein, Mueller, and Everyone Else Probing Him',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Rumors that President Donald Trump was close to firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or special counsel Robert Mueller have surfaced before. But the ones circulating on Monday evening—and the sources who were passing them on—were serious enough that on Tuesday morning, some Senate Democrats felt the need to huddle in anticipation of it actually happening, and happening soon. In fretful tones, they discussed what they would do in the immediate aftermath of Trump potentially axing the man investigating the possibility that he had colluded with Russian actors during the 2016 campaign and the DoJ official overseeing that investigation. Spearheaded by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) office, the outlines of a game plan for the constitutional armageddon emerged. As reported by CNN, lawmakers would demand that all documents related to the Mueller probe be preserved and that Republican lawmakers immediately and publicly join them in condemning the act. They would also go on a PR offensive, with sources telling The Daily Beast that, among other things, the party would task legal luminaries to fan out to media markets across the country to echo their shock with the president’s dispatching of constitutional norms.As of early Tuesday evening, Democratic leadership had no reason to ring this bell. But the seriousness with which they’ve begun not just considering the possibility but planning for it underscores the immense tenseness of this current political moment. Inside the White House, that tension is simmering, too. Senior staff have long been accustomed to hearing Trump privately discuss his desire to kick Mueller and Rosenstein to the curb, while failing so far to actually follow through—a bit of temperamental musing that occurred as recently as December, The New York Times reported Tuesday. It has become so commonplace, in fact, that it’s bordered on being considered routine. “Stop asking me if [Trump is] considering firing [Rosenstein], my answer is always going to be the same,” one West Wing official told The Daily Beast earlier this week—meaning, “yes.”But some of President Trump’s aides say there has been a conspicuous uptick this week in his ire toward the deputy attorney general. One White House official described it as reaching a “fever pitch” after reports emerged that Rosenstein had signed off on an FBI raid of the hotel and home of Trump’s longtime consigliere, Michael Cohen, over, among other things, matters related to hush money payments. Two senior White House aides told The Daily Beast that as soon as they saw the reports surface, they assumed, and feared, that the president would see it on a feedback loop on Fox News, grow incensed by it, and lash out accordingly. Another aide said the president appeared far more personally bothered by that Cohen news than anything else on his plate this week, including the atrocity in Syria for which his administration may be compelled to take military action.It doesn’t help Trump’s mood that some of his favorite TV hosts and informal political advisers have been publicly calling for the ouster of Rosenstein, Mueller, and the rest of “them.” On Monday, Fox Business star Lou Dobbs tore into the deputy attorney general. Fox News host and fellow Trump confidant Sean Hannity told viewers Monday evening that “this is now officially an all-hands-on-deck effort to totally malign and, if possible, impeach the president of the United States. Now, Mueller and Rosenstein have declared what is a legal war on the president.”On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not have much to add when pressed during the briefing if Trump had talked about nixing Sessions, Mueller, or Rosenstein in the last 24 hours. “I haven’t had any conversations with him on that,” she told reporters. She did not, however, shoot down the premise. “I can’t speak to it beyond that,” Sanders added.She also stressed that Trump had the legal authority to fire Mueller if he wanted. That is in sharp dispute. According to Department of Justice regulations, the special counsel may only be removed for “good cause” by the acting AG (in this case, Rosenstein, since the actual attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the investigation). Rosenstein is a presidential appointee and can be dismissed without cause. Should he be fired, the next to assume supervision of the special counsel’s office would be Solicitor General Noel Francisco, former Justice Department attorney Neal Katyal told The Daily Beast. (Katyal drafted the DOJ’s special counsel regulations in 1999.) If Francisco refused to fire Mueller, Trump could then theoretically fire him, until he found someone who would find the “cause” needed to fire the special counsel. (Hypothetically, Trump could also order the regulations—which are not law—to be repealed and fire Mueller himself, as Katyal has written.) To date, there has been nothing to give credence to the idea that there is cause to fire Mueller. A Department of Justice review cleared Mueller of potential ethics issues last May and Rosenstein has testified that he has found no reason to terminate him.

Nor has it stopped his press secretary from asserting that the president has the legal authority to do so. But while Democrats seem to be frightened, many Republicans continued to act on Tuesday as if it would never transpire. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fielded several questions about it during his weekly leadership press conference, each time shooting down the idea that Mueller had anything to worry about and dismissing the need to pass legislation protecting the special counsel. His colleagues echoed his calm. “I think we’re fine,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) said of the possibility that Trump may follow through on his Mueller threat before breezing through a gaggle of reporters.—with additional reporting by Jackie Kucinich"},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A flamboyant personality and a love-hate relationship with scrupulous honesty helped former Trump campaign adviser and longtime presidential ally Roger Stone build an unlikely career. Those same traits, however, threaten to ensnare the political consultant in Robert Mueller’s ever-widening prosecutorial net.On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Stone, in emails written to an associate of WikiLeaks founder-slash-embassy crasher Julian Assange, had solicited “damaging” information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the late stages of the 2016 presidential campaign.In those emails, sent to radio personality and perennial candidate for New York office Randy Credico, Stone requested that Credico ask Assange release to him “emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal in 2011.”“Please ask Assange for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30—particularly on August 20, 2011,” the Journal quotes one email as saying.When told by Credico that WikiLeaks would likely have published such information if it possessed it, Stone replied: “Why do we assume WikiLeaks has released everything they have ???”The emails appear to contradict Stone’s sworn testimony before the House Intelligence Committee last September, during which he said his solicitation of information from WikiLeaks indicated that he “merely wanted confirmation” that Assange had information about Clinton.That inconsistency is the latest wrinkle in Stone’s long-inconsistent description of his relationship with Assange, as well as any role he may have played in the actions of a Russian intelligence officer who took credit for providing WikiLeaks with stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee.On August 8, 2016, during a speech to the Southwest Broward Republican Organization, Stone told the audience that he was in communication with Assange regarding the Clinton Foundation, comments which were captured on video:“I actually have communicated with Assange,” Stone told a questioner who had asked for a “forecast” of potential October surprises. “I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation, but there’s no telling what the October surprise may be.”Stone would later claim he meant that he was communicating with Assange through “an intermediary.”'},

  'body': 'Michael Cohen’s legal troubles have claimed another victim: his personal memoir.Earlier this year, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer met with a number of publishers in New York, pitching a book which had been tentatively titled Trump Revolution: From The Tower to The White House, Understanding Donald J. Trump.In a copy of the proposal obtained by The Daily Beast, Cohen said that the book would detail his experiences serving as the Trump “family fix-it guy,” and would include his observations about everything from the 2016 campaign to what the proposal described as “the unfortunate saga involving Stephanie Clifford, also known as ‘Stormy Daniels.’”According to two sources with knowledge of the agreement, Cohen reached a deal to publish the book with Center Street, the conservative imprint of Hachette Book Group. But the same sources told The Daily Beast that in recent weeks, the book deal had been called off amid Cohen’s legal woes.In the months after shopping the book, Cohen became further engaged in a protracted legal fight with porn-actress Daniels over a $130,000 payment he made to her before the 2016 election to stay silent over her alleged affair with Trump. More seriously, federal prosecutors in New York have been investigating his personal business dealings.Daniels’ manager Gina Rodriguez told the Associated Press in February that Cohen had invalidated his non-disclosure agreement by promising to talk about the porn star in his book. It is unclear whether Cohen pulled the plug on his book himself, or Center Street backed out of the deal. The publisher did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When reached by The Daily Beast about this story, Cohen simply responded, “Who is this?” He did not respond after The Daily Beast reporter clarified who he was."In my experience, it is never a good idea for a guy who is under criminal investigation to be writing a book about the very topics for which he’s being investigated,” Stormy Daniels’s attorney Michael Avenatti, a leading antagonist of Cohen and his boss Donald J. Trump, told The Daily Beast on Thursday. “How stupid could you be?”When asked if he were Cohen’s attorney if he would have advised Trump’s longtime fixer to kill the book, Avenatti replied, “No question.” Cohen’s actual attorney, Stephen Ryan, did not respond to The Daily Beast’s questions on this subject.One of Cohen’s stated motivating factors in writing a memoir was his desire to tell the Trump story right—or his version of right.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

(It was, after all, Cohen who created the website “shouldtrumprun.com” back in 2011.)Cohen’s relationship with one of the aforementioned Trump operatives-turned-authors, Lewandowski, has been especially fraught for years. As The Daily Beast reported earlier this week, multiple sources in Trumpworld described something akin to “sibling rivalry” between the two men, each vying for the political and personal affections and approval of Trump.After Trump’s surprise election-night victory, Cohen saw Lewandowski poised to make potentially millions of dollars, due to his proximity to Trump, in the influence industry and Washington “swamp”—and the president’s personal lawyer wanted in on the action, as well.Ironically enough, Cohen’s impulse to, like Lewandowski, cash in on the Trump era via influence peddling is in part why Cohen has landed in scalding-hot water with the feds.And now all the scandal has, at least for now, cost him his book.“I have been working on a book and am extremely thankful that is has been well received and sought after by multiple publishers,” Cohen told The Daily Beast early this year.

 {'title': 'GOP Senators Losing Their Cool Over White House Vetting Fails',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Republican senators are growing increasingly frustrated with the White House for foisting upon them a parade of controversial cabinet nominees whom they believe haven’t gone through a proper vetting process.Throughout much of the Trump presidency, those frustrations have been shielded from public view out of deference to the president’s right to pick his own team. But a revolving door of high-level staff departures has forced GOP leaders to set aside valuable floor time—and expend already thin political capital—on tricky confirmation fights over controversial replacements. And not everyone is pleased.“I understand that the president wants his people—and we want to be deferential as much as we can—but it would be nice to know some of the issues that come up after the fact, before the fact,” said Sen. John Thune (R-SD), the third-ranking Republican in the Senate.The latest, most glaring pressure point—and the one to which Thune was alluding—emerged this week with the nomination of Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson, who currently serves as the top White House physician, has been accused of being drunk on the job, over-prescribing medications, and creating a hostile work environment. He has either denied, or stressed his desire to explain away, those allegations. But an equally significant concern among Republican senators is that those allegations surfaced not from an internal White House review, but through a vetting process conducted by the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, which is overseeing the confirmation.“In this case, I get the sense that there wasn’t any vetting, so I think that calls [the White House’s vetting process] into question,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) told The Daily Beast. Jackson’s confirmation hearing, which was initially scheduled for Wednesday, has been put on hold as the White House digs in to defend him. But with little overt support coming from Republican lawmakers, that defense might prove both brief and useless. On Wednesday night, The Washington Post reported that Jackson was considering dropping his bid. Should he withdraw, it would save lawmakers a potentially difficult vote. But it would do little to ease the tensions that have emerged between Congress and the administration. In addition to Jackson, the Senate is also considering nominees for the State Department and the CIA, alongside various ambassadorships.They also are being forced to grapple with the ethical lapses of cabinet members they’ve already voted to confirm, chief among them Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, whose own waves of controversy—from his living arrangements to his travel expenses—have sparked additional criticism of the White House. “If they prove to be true,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said of the allegations against Jackson, “it does raise questions about the vetting process, as do the allegations involving the allegations against Scott Pruitt that date back to his days in Oklahoma.”Many Republican senators remained reticent to publicly criticize the administration’s vetting of high-level nominees. But aides lamented what they viewed as a haphazard process that appeared more focused on whether a prospective nominee disqualified himself or herself by saying something negative about the president than whether he or she was qualified for the post.“The deliberation before nominating Ronny Jackson appears to have been little more than something like, ‘Ronny told a funny joke during my physical. Let’s make him VA secretary,’” a senior Republican aide told The Daily Beast. “Perhaps the staff dedicated to combing potential staff assistants’ Twitter feeds for phrases like ‘Cheeto Jesus’ and ‘tiny hands’ should be involved in the vetting process of senior staff and cabinet nominees.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Jackson’s nomination has been, for many on Capitol Hill, the perfect illustration of this problematic vetting process. His primary qualification for the post seemed to be his proximity to Trump and his praise of the president’s health when explaining the results of a physical on live television. Indeed, even before the allegations against him came to light, lawmakers were concerned that Jackson did not have the leadership experience necessary to run a behemoth of a department that has vexed top military leaders, seasoned bureaucrats, and high-profile business executives before. “Particularly with a position this important, this big, it’s concerning that they didn’t have a better vetting process. I had my concerns from the beginning in terms of qualifications and experience, but these new allegations are something that should have been explored and explained before he was offered up,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said in an interview. “This is not ideal. In particular when it’s someone so close to the president, but without any general qualifications for the job. That’s a concern that’s shared by a lot of my colleagues.”"},
 {'title': 'National Democrats Want to Make Judicial Elections the Next Crest in the Blue Wave',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Former Vice President Joe Biden did a robocall on Monday. Eric Holder’s group, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, has spent $165,000. Tom Steyer’s organization is running a get-out-the-vote operation. And a pro-business advocacy group has dropped nearly a $1 million. The recipients of this political largess aren’t running for a governor’s seat or the Senate or even a high-profile House race. Rather, they are the two candidates duking it out for a seat on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court in a race that comes to a close April 3. The contest pits Rebecca Dallet, a Milwaukee County Judge and national Democratic favorite, against Sauk County Judge Michael Screnock, who has the backing of, among others, the National Rifle Association and Republican Governor Scott Walker. So far, an excess of $2.5 million has been spent on TV ads in the election, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. That’s not an altogether remarkable figure. But the parachuting in of national figures combined with that investment, demonstrates the degree to which parties and allied outside groups have put an increasing premium on judicial races. At the start of 2017, 20 out of 38 states that elect their justices had at least one sitting justice who had been involved in a $1 million-plus election—compared to just seven states holding that distinction in 1999. And though it’s a non-presidential election year, the trend could very well continue through 2018, as Democrats hope to capitalize on their current electoral momentum with 74 judicial seats in 32 states in play in 2018.The framework of the elections vary state by state and for years, conservative-leaning local groups have often paid more interest and attention to judicial contests than their Democratic counterparts. Wisconsin, Democrats hope, will be emblematic of a new political dynamic as the party looks to more forcefully target all corners of electoral politics, from congressional seats, to statehouses, to the countries’ courts, its district attorneys and even sheriffs. “Increasingly, I think, us along with a lot of progressive actors have really felt that elections pose one of the most powerful ways to change policy,” Faiz Shakir, national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Daily Beast in an interview. “In a large race...there are so many issues at play and it’s unlikely that you could just make criminal justice the sole major issue at play. Whereas in some of these smaller races, and ones that have less turnout, you can really make it a threshold question.”Shakir said that the ACLU has spent roughly $120,000 on the Wisconsin race, in addition to conducting phone banks, canvassing and sending out mailers. They do not endorse or oppose candidates but rather engage in voter education. Its more aggressive dip into judicial contests likely won’t end in Wisconsin either. After this race, the group will be taking a look at the open seat on North Carolina’s Supreme Court though nothing is set in stone in terms of tangible action. Holder’s involvement in Wisconsin has been a bit more direct. In addition to the $165,000 his group put into digital ads, the former Attorney General also spent a couple of days in the state in mid-March “encouraging people to get engaged and vote for Rebecca Dallet,” Patrick Rodenbush, communications director for NDRC told The Daily Beast. Wisconsin is one of twelve states NDRC is targeting as part of its campaign to promote more fairly drawn congressional maps. While Rodenbush said they have not made specific decisions on down ballot races in the fall, he said the NDRC will look at the state Supreme Court contests, citing the importance of the body in producing fairer maps in states like Pennsylvania.As of now, ACLU and NDRC are the two primary, progressive-minded national outfits that are focusing specifically on these judicial contests. But in the Wisconsin race, billionaire Tom Steyer’s NextGen America is also involved. Olivia Bercow, press secretary for the group, told The Daily Beast that their “youth organizing team” has been doing door-knocking in Madison and Milwaukee. Additionally, NextGen America is raising money for Dallet on its online fundraising platform. “We're committed to electing progressives up and down the ballot in 2018, and expect to educate and turn out young voters in races from judicial contests to Congress to Governor,” Bercow said of future plans. As for Biden, he came to the Wisconsin race by happenstance. The former Vice President only learned about Dallet’s contest after the executive director of his PAC, American Possibilities, talked to a state chair in Wisconsin who mentioned it, according to a Biden aide who described the backstory to The Daily Beast. Biden’s view, said the aide, was that “If I could be helpful, I’d like to be helpful.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Along with his endorsement, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) have backed Dallet as well. The national exposure has been a boost for Dallet. But not without some negative side effects. Being so closely associated with some of the luminaries of the Democratic Party has led Screnock’s campaign to charge that she has “liberal activist policies.” Dallet didn’t help her cause when she reportedly told the crowd at a San Francisco fundraiser: “your values are our Wisconsin values that we’ve lost along the way.” Republicans have taken notice of the Democratic efforts.“Liberals and progressives, like Eric Holder, have an organized effort to pick off partisan state Supreme Courts to short-circuit the legislative branches of government to rig the system to their own advantage,” David James, spokesman for the Republican State Leadership Committee told The Daily Beast. “You have a very desperate Democrat party looking for alternate avenues to push their agenda because they have failed miserably at the state level in the past decade.”According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, the Republican Party of Wisconsin had contributed almost $300,000 to Screnock as of March 27. The NRA has dove in too, saying in its endorsement that Screnock “is a committed judge who will interpret the Constitution the way our Founding Fathers intended.” Whoever wins on Tuesday will serve a ten-year term. If Dallet is the victor, she’ll reduce the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3. As judicial elections emerge as the next big frontier in big-moneyed politics, some experts worry about the pernicious side-effects, chief among them the increased politicization of the judiciary and the heightened likelihood of potential conflict of interests. “I don’t think it’s good for our system to have judges looking like politicians in robes,” Alicia Bannon, Deputy Director for Program Management at the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program told The Daily Beast. Bannon said that at this point, it’s hard to predict what spending will look like in future 2018 contests because the investments are often concentrated in the last few weeks of the campaign. She noted also that in non-presidential election years, there is less spending overall. But, even so, the larger trend is still worrisome. “It creates an appearance that special interests may be able to buy justice,” Bannon said. "},
 {'title': 'Ex-EPA Official’s Legal Advocacy Outfit Embroiled in Vicious Leadership Struggle',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A leading conservative legal advocacy group is at risk of dissolving amid an ugly internal fight over control of the organization.The Free Market Environmental Law Clinic is known for its use of the legal system to advance conservative energy and environmental policy goals. But now its executives—including a former senior official at Scott Pruitt’s Environmental Protection Agency—are waging a legal battle for control of the group.At the center of the allegations is David Schnare, the ostensible head of FME Law. Schnare founded and led the group until he was appointed to a senior EPA position in January 2017. Now Schnare’s onetime colleagues are accusing him of, among other things, misrepresenting the group’s structure to the IRS in order to obtain tax exempt status, attempting to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from the group for himself and a partner, and threatening to report FME Law for allegedly illegal fundraising practices unless it agrees to the “payout.”Schnare denies all of the allegations. “The arguments aren’t grounded in facts,” he told The Daily Beast in an interview. “It’s all based on incorrect data.”Some of the legal issues will be hammered out in a Virginia court this week, where Schnare is set to present evidence countering his former colleagues’ allegations. The whole thing, he says, is “like a bad divorce.”The spat represents a dramatic and sudden decline for an organization at the vanguard of conservative legal advocacy efforts. It also illustrates the challenges and divisions that have popped up in segments of the conservative movement as it’s transitioned from pure opposition during the Obama years to, under Trump, a position of major influence on high-profile policy-making decisions.Schnare first joined the EPA in 1978 and served as an attorney in the agency for 33 years. He returned in January 2017 as a member of the Trump administration’s “beachhead” team. But he lasted less than two months in the post. Schnare quickly clashed with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, whom he felt was not aggressive enough in rolling back Obama-era regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. After Schnare’s departure in March, he vowed to publicly expose his internal adversaries, but declined to go into detail about his interactions with Pruitt or internal deliberations at EPA.“He wanted to be treated like he was the president,” Schnare said of Pruitt. “I think you could describe me as prescient.FME Law is one of a handful of groups that has used the courts to attempt to enact conservative energy and environmental policy reforms. It has been party to nearly two dozen federal lawsuits against the EPA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and other federal agencies, seeking to roll back environmental regulations and produce public records revealing regulators’ internal discussions and decision-making process.At FME Law’s helm since its founding were Schnare and Chris Horner, a member of Trump’s EPA transition team and an attorney affiliated with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a leading free market think tank. Horner is a prolific filer of open records requests and lawsuits seeking to compel their production. The author of the the 2012 book The Liberal War on Transparency: Confessions of a Freedom of Information “Criminal,” Horner was a frequent thorn in the side of Obama’s EPA, exposing, among other revelations, then-Administrator Lisa Jackson’s use of a private email address, and the alias Richard Windsor, in some internal communications.Schnare and Horner conceived FME Law, initially called the George Mason Environmental Law Clinic, in 2011. According to an email from Schnare, it “came out of Chris and my joint efforts to build an organization that can push back against the overreach of government action.”After years of collaboration, and some notable victories, Schnare and Horner are now at each other’s throats. And FME Law may shutter altogether as a result.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The problems began when Schnare took a leave of absence from the group to join Trump’s EPA. He told colleagues that he expected to spend three or four years at the agency and then retire. As his last official act, he installed another attorney, Chaim Mandelbaum, as FME Law’s executive director, and stepped back from day to day operations.But Schnare insists that he retained his official position atop the group, and that he resumed day to day management after leaving the EPA. He also had significant control over the group’s finances, having at one point deposited FME Law funds in a savings account opened under his social security number. After he left for EPA, Schnare says, financial control was handed off to Mandelbaum. But internal documents show that the group’s directors had to take action in late June 2017 to remove Schnare’s name from one of the group’s bank accounts, though Schnare says that FME Law was always the account’s official owner.In late 2017, a new board prepared to take the helm at FME Law. On a conference call, the board, including its incoming chairman, Matthew Hardin, asked to review the organization’s financial position. Mandelbaum provided a one-page, bullet-pointed list of liabilities and assets, showing it had about $920,000 of the latter.But when the board requested all of the group’s books and financial records, according to the complaint, Mandelbaum balked. He indicated that he did not recognize the new board’s authority to request the information—and in fact said that the board did not have any authority at all.In an email two days later, Schnare explained the problem. “It appears I made some significant errors when preparing the by-laws and related papers for FME Law,” he admitted. In particular, the group was structured to give controlling authority to its board, but under Virginia law a law clinic’s board members must be registered to practice in the state, and only one of the new board members was. Schnare had assumed that he was the sole “member” of the corporate entity housing FME Law. But its bylaws appeared to contradict that conclusion as well.Schnare and Hardin agreed to hire an outside law firm to sort out the matter. But what they found was even more damning: The group was legally paralyzed. “As currently organized, FME cannot act,” the firm, Gross & Romanick, concluded in a January 2018 memo. “The board of directors is not properly constituted to manage a [professional limited liability corporation].” Schnare could be considered a governing member, but “in signing the bylaws that indicates there are no members, he disclaimed any membership interest that he may have had.”Schnare says the latter conclusion was erroneous, that the law firm was working with incomplete documentation, and that FME Law never had bylaws or an operating agreement.Ordinarily, the firm wrote, those sorts of issues could be resolved by a court-appointed receiver brought on to address the problems with its corporate structure. But it turned out that Schnare hadn’t just goofed up FME Law’s bylaws; Gross & Romanick concluded that he also made material misstatements in his application to the IRS for 501(c)(3) nonprofit tax status that could land the group in legal jeopardy if a court-appointed receiver reported the issues to the IRS, as it would be legally obligated to do. (Schnare says he did inform the IRS of the underlying issues, and while the group’s later annual tax filings note that it is a professional limited liability company, not a corporation—the distinction at issue—he has acknowledged that its initial application for tax exempt status misstated its corporate form.)That left the group in limbo, and its ostensible corporate officers fighting it out over control of the organization. And according to Schnare’s internal antagonists, this is when the threats began.FME Law’s legal complaint says that Schnare began requesting “a payout” to “keep things quiet” about the legal issues created by the group’s initial tax filing in 2011. “If the IRS were to investigate and rule that tax exempt status was improperly obtained, FME would likely be forced to disgorge any monies raised and any contributors would have to amend their personal tax returns to reflect donations to a nonexempt entity,” Gross & Romanick had warned. “In such a scenario, it is likely that the members of the board would have some exposure for misrepresenting the status of the organization.”The “payout” was to be in the range of $280,000. Schnare says that it wasn’t hush money, but simply an effort to reconcile contractual obligations to contractors. The bulk of the funds were owed to Mandelbaum under the terms of his contract, he said. He declined to say where the rest of the funds would go.Schnare, FME claims in its complaint, also threatened to sick Virginia authorities on the group, and on Horner in particular. “Things are getting out of hand,” he wrote in a Jan. 27 email to Horner. “It is in no one’s interest to end up in court, especially yours as it would be discovered that you engaged in fundraising without FME Law or yourself being registered to do so, placing you subject to criminal penalties.”At a meeting the same day, according to FME Law’s legal complaint, Schnare suggested that “the Democratic attorney general of Virginia” would be keen to investigate the group due to its conservative political leanings.Asked whether those amounted to threats, as his former colleagues alleged, Schnare said, “I have no idea how thin their skin is.” He quickly added, “There were no threats, absolutely none,” and noted that a recent investigation by the Virginia Bar had cleared him of allegations surrounding those statements.But that hasn’t smoothed relations between Horner, Hardin, Schnare, and others who once worked together amiably. “It might be possible that we would dissolve,” Schnare said, “in which case there are people with whom we have longstanding relationships who would like to carry on the work we’ve been doing.”“There’s no reason not to carry on those relationships,” he said, “even though the friendships have died.”"},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "New York Democratic gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon roasted her primary opponent Gov. Andrew Cuomo during an address in Albany on Tuesday. “Vote for the homo, not for the Cuomo,” Nixon said during her rebuttal to the annual Legislative Correspondents Association dinner. The line was a reference to the 1977 New York City mayoral campaign which pitted Ed Koch against Cuomo’s father Mario. During the campaign, flyers appeared with the line saying “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo,” which Koch had blamed on the Cuomo camp.When Nixon first announced her run earlier this year, former New York City Council Speaker and mayoral candidate Christine Quinn\xa0referred to the new candidate as an “unqualified lesbian,” for which she later apologized. Nixon subsequently began printing campaign buttons and t-shirts with the phrase on them. The rest of the former Sex and the City star’s 12-minute address was similarly merciless.“I hear that Andrew Cuomo has not attended this event very often as governor and I’ve been trying to figure out why,” Nixon said. “Because it’s such a fabulous evening. It must be either that he dislikes the press, or that he can't laugh at himself or just that he won't come to any event that’s less than $25,000 a plate.”She also referenced a famous line from Michelle Obama in the 2016 presidential campaign, in the context of Nixon’s desire to legalize marijuana. “It’s like Michelle Obama sort of said: When they go low, we get high,” Nixon joked.She also poked fun at how her upstart candidacy has already influenced Cuomo’s policy positions from the left, saying, “At the rate Cuomo is changing, I expect that he’ll be rolling a joint in his first campaign ad.”Linking the process of coming out as gay to Cuomo being an allegedly fake Democrat, Nixon said: “I think it’s time for Andrew Cuomo to come out as a Republican. The rumors have been out there for years. He’s not fooling anyone. Who knows why he’s stayed in the closet this long.”"},
 {'title': 'Does Jesus Want Gun-Toting Christians?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "“If you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one,” Jesus once told his disciples. Also Jesus: “all who draw the sword will die by the sword” and “turn the other cheek.” These words exemplify the very different portraits of Jesus that Christians have when it comes to issues like gun control, gun rights, and self-defense.Is it ethical to defend oneself or one’s family? Does Jesus want his people to be packing?By the numbers only, most Christians support stricter gun control laws. According to a national tracking poll of Americans from Morning Consult—following the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida—approximately 62 percent of all Christians “strongly,” or “somewhat,” support “stricter gun control laws in the United States,” while 33 percent do not. In fact, the majority of Christians (Protestant or Catholic) appear to support stronger gun laws to varying degrees: Protestants (60 percent), Roman Catholics (67 percent), and evangelicals (58 percent). But this is not the same as saying these Christians oppose gun ownership, self-defense, or justified wars. The reality is more complex. For example, according to data from Pew Research analyzed by Christianity Today, most white evangelicals who own handguns also carry (65 percent), but most evangelicals also support stronger restrictions for things like mental health issues (89 percent), background checks at gun shows (80 percent), or bans on assault-style weapons (63 percent). \xa0Theologians, however, do not live by statistics alone; they look to the Bible for God’s overall message. So why do Christians come away from the same Bible with different perspectives on the issue of guns and self-defense?First, there are those passages where Jesus advocates a nonviolent approach to one’s enemies, such as “blessed are the peacemakers” (Matt. 5:9). “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’,” preaches Jesus in Matthew 5:38-39. “But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.” But these non-violent passages may not be the final word on the subject. When Jesus warns his disciples that things are about to get rough—meaning he is about to be arrested and crucified—he tells them in Luke 22:36-38, that “if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.” The disciples take him literally and say, “here are two swords,” and Jesus tells them “that’s enough.” Shortly after this, however, there is a plot twist; when the high priest arrives to arrest Jesus, Peter takes out his sword and cuts off the ear of the priest’s servant. Jesus doesn’t congratulate him on his swordplay. Instead, he heals the ear and says “No more of this!” (22:47-53). In a parallel telling of the story, Jesus tells him, “Put your sword back in its place...for all who draw the sword will die by the sword” (Matt. 26:52). So which is it? Does he want the disciples to defend themselves with swords (guns, for the modern Christian) or not?

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Larry Pratt, the executive director emeritus of Gun Owners of America believes he does. According to Pratt, the Second Amendment’s statement that “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” is literal and sanctioned by God. \xa0“The Founders considered that self-defense and the ownership and carrying of guns is a God-given right,” Pratt tells The Daily Beast. “And there is a basic principle regarding the protection of life found in the Book of Proverbs [25:26]: ‘Like a muddied spring or a polluted well are the righteous who give way to the wicked.’”According to Pratt, this God-given right is why the Militia Act and the Second Amendment were passed so closely together. “In that Act, all military age men were required to have a military long gun,” says Pratt. He adds that while this doesn’t include artillery, “the idea was that whatever every soldier had to own, so every man had to own.” And this is because, as he sees it, the Republic’s founders believed God intended individuals to defend themselves. “Christ made the same point to his disciples shortly before he was murdered by the Romans,” adds Pratt, pointing to Christ’s command to buy swords in Luke.More than a theological ideal, there are also practical applications of this reading of the Bible—like protecting one’s church during worship. Pastor Jeff Ryan of Calvary Bible Church in Rogers City, Michigan, sees no reason for the Second Amendment to be “revoked or changed.” It is essential for maintaining liberty, he tells me, though he supports “reasonable regulation” when it comes to keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals or the “mentally unstable.”“I serve two churches,” says Ryan, who also acts as an interim pastor at a small church in a farming community. “I know of one person who carries in the smaller, rural church.” \xa0For reasons of protecting his congregation, Ryan’s not opposed to congregants carrying during worship, though safety remains an open conversation.“A couple of years ago,” says Ryan, “we faced a situation where a mentally unstable man was threatening me and others, and we were uncertain of his whereabouts. One man came to me privately before the service to let me know he carried, and he would sit in the back and watch the door during the service (which he continues to do). At my primary church, in that situation, we locked the doors and called someone (an off-duty deputy, the son of a member) to be present on those two Sundays during the crisis. But on a normal Sunday, I do not know of anyone who carries, though we would welcome that from our known members.” Physical threats against churches is not unheard of, and last year First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas was the target of such an armed attack. In that instance, Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 individuals, wounding 20 others. He was eventually shot by an armed neighbor while fleeing. When asked about Jesus’s teaching to turn the other cheek, Ryan sees that as forbidding vengeance. He understands concealed carry in church as a “safety measure.” It is one thing to not seek personal revenge, he says, but that “doesn’t mean that we just let evil people run rampant in our community or in our churches. It’s about letting God be God and leaving it to him and his ways to right our wrongs.”But if there is anything obvious in American Christianity, it is that there is more than one way to read the Bible. Not all Christians agree that Jesus’s teachings allow for a concept of justified force. Dr. Ron Sider, distinguished senior professor of theology, holistic ministry & public policy at Palmer Theological Seminary and author of Nonviolent Action: What Christian Ethics Demands but Most Christians Have Never Really Tried, believes that Jesus taught pacifism. “It is quite clear that Jesus was teaching in a context where many of his Jewish contemporaries wanted the nation to rise up in an armed rebellion against Rome,” Sider tells me, but “Jesus clearly says, I don’t want my disciples to kill; I want them to love their enemies” (Matt. 5:44). According to Sider, the idea of a just war and the right to self-defense appears in Christianity after Emperor Constantine legalized the faith in the Edict of Milan in 313. Until that time, he says, “every Christian writer that writes about the topic of killing, whether it is abortion, capital punishment, or war, says that Christians should not, and do not, do that.”In the hundred years following Constantine, he says, things changed. It is only with the highly influential theologian, St. Augustine that the idea of a just war—fighting to defend one’s nation—appears. Though, even then, he adds, Augustine did not believe in killing for personal vengeance.Sider says that the “vast majority of scholars” do not see Jesus as advocating for buying swords in Luke 22:36.“I mean, it’s just absurd to think that two swords would be enough even for twelve disciples,” says Sider. “And furthermore, just a few hours later, one of the disciples (Peter), in fact, uses a sword and cuts off the ear of the high priest’s servant when they come to arrest Jesus, and Jesus rebukes him in a general way, saying, those who use the sword will perish by the sword.”Daniel Kirk, pastoral director at Newbigin House of Studies, also believes that an American vision of individual gun rights and self-defense is not the same as Christ’s. \xa0“As an American,” says Daniel Kirk, “my current view is that the Second Amendment gives us the right to defend ourselves against government forces. The firepower required for this in the twenty-first century cannot be safely kept in a home. People should have the right to own military grade weaponry that is always stored and locked in armories with their local well-regulated militias, national guards, etc. Hunting and self-defense are other issues that we need to separate from conversation about our Constitutional rights.”“As a Christian,” he clarifies, “my position on guns is not a reflection on particular verses but the overall Jesus narrative. In both the gospels and the New Testament letters the self-giving love of Jesus to the point of death defines faithful Christian ethics. Devoting oneself to instruments designed for the purpose of taking human life is a non-Christian practice.” When it comes to Jesus telling his disciples to buy swords—and his disciples response that they have two—Kirk and Sider believe the disciples are missing the point and that Jesus is speaking symbolically about troubling times ahead. “The disciples, who are forever misunderstanding the suffering nature of Jesus’s mission, try to use the sword for self-defense,” says Kirk, “but Jesus persists in his life-giving mission of holistic restoration….It was not an abandonment of his non-coercive deployment of power in favor of armed revolution or even violent self-defense.”Kirk adds. “The story of our salvation is trusting God to the point of death. How can choosing to send someone else to their death be an expression of faith?”Larry Pratt disagrees with this view of Jesus, noting that Christians who point to passages like Jesus’s rebuke of Peter after he cut off the servant’s ear are ignoring a parallel telling of the story in Matthew 26:53-54. There Jesus reminds Peter that if he wanted to defend himself, he could easily call on his Father and immediately have at his “disposal more than twelve legions of angels.” “The context makes it clear that these were not timeless commands such as ‘Don’t murder,’” says Pratt. Jesus chided Peter because his actions ignored why Christ was being arrested in the first place—“only the death of the Son of God could pay for man’s sin,” says Pratt. What these individuals have in common is the belief that God wants them to preserve life. The question is, whose life? In any case, the decisions come with serious ramifications and responsibilities. For example, when asked what Sider would do if an intruder threatened the life of his family, he said that while he thought such a situation would be extremely rare, he would have to follow Jesus’s command for nonviolence and trust God. “In a situation, where somebody was threatening to kill my wife or children, I would pray fervently. I would express love to the person, and I would say, ‘In the name of the risen Jesus, Lord of history, I command you to stop.’ And if I died, and my family died, I would trust that would be a better outcome than my trying to kill such a person.”For others, however, protecting life means living with other choices.“It is part of caring for our people, just as a parent may choose to do in their home in caring for their family,” says Jeff Ryan. “Our mission is to preach the gospel of the kingdom of Christ, but that does not take away the right to defend ourselves.” "},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump Does Deals, and Ivanka Trump Does Well',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The president likes a deal, and this is a moment for Republicans, who are beginning to show some spine, to make one. How about they work with Trump on his trade war—or is it a trade skirmish? He can have naming rights in exchange for his opening up the books on his and Ivanka’s continued business dealings, in particular those with China. Congress has negotiating power right now with Trump given that he’s in the hole over his impulsive, unilateral proposal to lift sanctions on Chinese telecom giant ZTE. This came in too-close-for-comfort proximity to Ivanka getting seven trademarks in a month from China worth millions, bringing to 13 her total over the last year. The Chinese love celebrity goods, but not that much. With Trump and Ivanka having so many intermingled interests—in business, in government, in a father-favorite daughter relationship, it’s no wonder there’s curiosity mingled with suspicion about how they are handling it all, and whether they’re working solely for the country and not for themselves.A look at the ZTE proposal is a case in point. Even for Trump of the Instant North Korean Summit that may yield a hamburger franchise, cooking up this deal with Xi on his own was remarkable. There was no interagency review. He didn’t get the go ahead from anyone in his Cabinet, nor his economic advisers. He simply announced by tweet, “President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost.”Who knew? The Commerce Department had just put the sanctions on; they were hardly going to lift them. And the usually quiescent Congress, which can see its way clear to go along with a bogus conspiracy at the FBI and blaming Democrats for children going missing at the border, couldn’t stay quiet on a sweetheart deal with the Chinese. On Face the Nation this past Sunday, Sen. Marco Rubio said he spoke with Trump on Friday and still didn’t understand why he wanted to let ZTE off the hook. The Florida Republican said he viewed ZTE as part of China’s effort “to overtake the United States by stealing and by cheating and they’re not going to stop until they know there are real consequences for doing it.” As of a few weeks ago, Trump couldn’t have put it better. As usual, there is collateral damage when the president goes rogue. As first reported by BuzzFeed, an assistant secretary of Commerce was frog-marched out of the building last week by security just as ZTE was becoming a problem. The White House doesn’t comment on personnel matters but it’s curious that Erin Walsh—a former Goldman Sachs executive, respected global economist concerned about trade and China, and Senate-confirmed official—would be treated this way at the moment Trump needs someone with a title to believe saving ZTE is a good idea. Trump lamented last week how many bright-eyed people (he’s thinking Michael Flynn) came to Washington to serve only to be cruelly ruined by the press. The bright-eyed person at Commerce wasn’t ruined by the press. She was ruined by the president. Right now, there’s no congressional oversight and no real ethics review given that the head of that office resigned in frustration at how little the Trumps were willing to divulge and how unwilling to change their M.O. from hustling out of Trump Tower to governing in the White House.Trump should be willing to put more transparency on the table for help in his erratic effort to improve the trade deficit with China,, especially when he needs Congress to make room for his friends and family program. One day it’s steel and aluminum and soybeans, the next day he loves the 747 and farmers too much for that. That’s more at play when it comes to keeping XiI in the mood to look kindly on Ivanka, whose success is dependent on Beijing’s largesse. Clothing already has a carve out. Perfume, throw pillows, housewares—there’s hardly an end to the need for trademarks. Dad already proved invaluable when Ivanka sat in on a meeting with Xi at Mar-a-Lago early in the administration. A raft of trademarks was forthcoming. It’s unusual for Trump to be confronted about his conflicts. There are so many of them, and so many other scandals that there’s just not enough ink to spill on all of them. His hotel gets scrutiny because there it sits a few blocks from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., a show of conflict every night as people pay $50 for a hamburger and $700 for a room to bank credit with the president should it ever be needed. Ethics experts are certain this violates the Constitution when it comes to foreign officials. So far no one’s been able—or willing—to do anything about it. It’s even more unusual for Ivanka to be questioned about her conflicts. She may be a White House adviser and famous business executive but she’s treated more like a first daughter in her teenage years deserving protection from the meanies in the press. On Tuesday, when a question about her new trademarks came up in a conference call about a White House sports initiative, she dropped off the line, according to The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman. Reporters couldn’t see that Ivanka was wearing her unpaid adviser hat, not her Trump Inc. one available with free shipping on her website. HuffPost recently reported that Ivanka took in $1.5 million from the Trump Organization since her father became president. Trump may well have to come to the bargaining table involuntarily. If Trump doesn’t drop the ZTE thing altogether, Republican senators are threatening to thwart him with legislation passed by a supermajority that can’t be vetoed. Think of the last time they posed any such resistance. How’s never?So really. Can’t we all get along, if not on Mueller, or Sessions, or Roseanne Barr, on taking a knee or building a wall, at least on the Trumps coming clean on their business affairs in China so that Congress can get more of a grip on what’s right and what isn’t? There is no saying for sure that Ivanka got her trademarks because Trump plotted with Xi to rescue ZTE. But until the Trumps give Congress a glimpse behind the curtain, the burden of proof is on the president and his daughter to prove otherwise.'},
 {'title': 'Lawyer Claims Trump Knew About Schneiderman’s Misconduct Years Ago',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In a letter to a judge submitted Friday, New York attorney Peter Gleason tells a convoluted tale of how he was informed of ex-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's behavior towards women years ago—and so was President Trump and his personal attorney Michael Cohen. Gleason, a “civil rights and personal injury” lawyer, alleges in the letter that two “unrelated” women approached his office “approximately 1 year apart” in 2012 and 2013, both claiming that the former state attorney general was “sexually inappropriate with them.”Gleason states that he advised both of these women to stay quiet, telling the first that the powers at be would eventually tilt towards protecting Schneiderman, and advising the second not to report this to the AG’s office—claiming his previous experiences reporting corruption to the office were “ignored” or “prosecuted elsewhere.” Enter Stephen Dunleavy, a former New York Post columnist and host of tabloid show A Current Affair during the 1980s and ’90s. Gleason claims he spoke to Dunleavy to make sure the women’s stories were not pushed “under the rug.”From there, Dunleavy allegedly told Gleason what he would speak to Donald Trump—just New York real estate mogul and reality TV show host at the time—about the issue. Gleason claims that Cohen then called him, confirming that Dunleavy spoke to the president.Gleason submitted the letter to obtain a “protective order” against any communications he had with Cohen “concerning two women that were sexually victimized by Mr. Schneiderman” in order to protect their privacy.While there is nothing currently public to corroborate Gleason’s claims, a Trump tweet from 2013 seemingly alludes to Schneiderman’s sexual misconduct, pairing him with Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer—both politicians disgraced by sexual-misconduct allegations.“Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone,” Trump wrote in September 2013. “[N]ext will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner.”Trump was also publicly feuding with Schneiderman at the time over an ongoing Trump University case. According to Bloomberg, “Schneiderman sought to sue Trump University in state court in 2012, and filed a complaint the next year in federal court.” Schneiderman claimed that Trump University was “defraud[ing] students”—a case he prosecuted up until last year’s settlement.Additionally, in a 2014 article in The Observer, which was run by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner at the time, Trump is quoted saying that he wouldn’t quietly settle Schneiderman’s case against him. “At this point in life, I’m just not going to be pushed around,” he said. “I’d rather spend more defending myself than it would cost to settle.”The future president even tweeted at J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon that same year, telling him to “stop settling” with “lightweight” Schneiderman.Although, given Trump’s penchant for tough talk about his own business dealings and harsh tweets about his rivals, these comments are not necessarily corroborating evidence of any prior knowledge of allegations against Schneiderman.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

According to the New York Daily News, he was once “a cop, a firefighter, a real-estate investor and a failed politician.” He ran for Manhattan DA in both 2013 and 2017. He put his own place up for his client’s bail in 2012, and attempted to buy Elvis Presley’s home with a friend. "},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Pentagon Opens Up Guantanamo Bay to New Prisoners',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is now formally set to receive new inmates for an indefinite stay, the Pentagon confirmed Wednesday. In what amounts to a fulfilled campaign promise for Donald Trump, who had pledged to refill Guantanamo with “some bad dudes,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis delivered a long-expected detentions policy to the White House, a day after the deadline set by Trump’s January executive order paving the way for new Guantanamo detainees. “This policy provides our warfighters guidance on nominating detainees for transfer to Guantanamo detention should that person present a continuing, significant threat to the security of the United States,” said Navy Cdr. Sarah Higgins, the Pentagon’s detentions spokesperson. Much remains unclear about the new policy, which neither the Pentagon nor the White House released. The criteria for determining the threshold for a detainee’s “continuing, significant threat” was not defined, nor was who within the chain of command will be empowered to recommend that decision. National Security Council representatives did not immediately respond to questions. “‘Continuing, significant threat,’ while it might read as more narrow than previous [policies], the determination is largely going to be a subjective one rather than an objective one,” said Vince Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. “It provides no more clarity and guidance for people implementing or challenging that policy than previous ones.” As of Monday, Mattis had not seen any policy recommendation his subordinates had developed. “Right now, I’m not working that issue,” he told reporters earlier this week. But Mattis indicated his disinclination to return to the physical abuses that occurred at Guantanamo during Donald Rumsfeld’s tenure, saying he was “absolutely certain that there is not one thing going on down there that would not be in accordance with the international protocol—the Geneva protocol.The U.S. military is not known to have detainees in custody in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, its primary warzones, outside of an anonymous American citizen captured in September and held in Iraq since as an enemy combatant. \xa0Yet on Tuesday, the State Department announced that the military had begun “operations to liberate the final ISIS strongholds in Syria,” heightening the prospect for U.S. troops to capture Islamic State fighters. There were 41 men detained at Guantanamo at the time the Pentagon gave its new detentions policy to the White House, all of whom have been there for over a decade, the vestige of Barack Obama’s broken promise to shutter the facility. Under the Trump administration, the process for transferring detainees cleared by an interagency panel out of Guantanamo has ground to a halt. It is unclear if the new detentions policy will place any additional urgency on transfers or entrench the indefinite nature of Guantanamo captivity. A 2008 Supreme Court ruling, Boumediene v. Bush, provides Guantanamo detainees with the right to challenge their detentions in federal court, but that so-called habeas corpus process has been a slog as well. Similarly, the new detentions policy comes as Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) have proposed a new legislative footing for continued U.S. wars against a host of terrorist groups. Their bill text contains no new language on detentions, but battlefield captures are traditionally considered an entailed aspect of military operations, meaning their bill would authorize detentions for members of ISIS—something arguably absent under existing authorities.“This policy rips the lid open for refilling Guantanamo,” said Warren of the Center for Constitutional Rights. “It has the same generalized deformities that previous policies have, leaving it to people on the ground to make determinations about dangerousness that will follow through another generation of detainees to fight the same legal battles as the previous generation.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

It’s the first detainee transfer of the Trump administration, and it brings the Guantanamo detainee population down to 40 men. For now."},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump Is Competent at One Thing: Making the Media Jump From Scandal to Scandal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'I’ll say one thing for Donald Trump. He can take any problem and push it off the front page. As with a child, it doesn’t have to last long, just enough time to get a respite from one scandal by shifting attention to another.\xa0Take the summit. Back in March, as a 60 Minutes interview of Stormy Daniels was scheduled to run in a week and was Topic A in Washington, Trump leapt at the flimsiest of\xa0\xa0chances to negotiate with Kim, abruptly switching his strategy of demeaning Kim Jong Un to sitting down with him on the basis of almost nothing. The South Korean envoy Chung Eui-yong had simply told Trump that Kim was eager to meet and it was due, Chung said, to Trump’s “leadership and maximum pressure policy.”\xa0Or naievete. Trump either considered the invitation a breakthrough due to his willful ignorance of history or a welcome opportunity to move the conversation away from his lawyer trying to enjoin CBS from airing the Daniels’ story, or both. A summit could permit him to so dazzle the world with his peacemaking skills, it could dominate coverage for weeks,\xa0drowning out two more women lawyer Michael Avenatti says are in the wings ready to offer proof he paid them off.\xa0One day the murderous dictator was Little Rocket Man with a small button; the next, a leader worthy of sitting across from the most powerful man in the world. There was nothing in writing but Trump nonetheless made a pop-up appearance in the press room to tease that he would have a really big announcement soon.The Insta-Summit was so sudden his national security staff was caught off guard, yammering platitudes about it. Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, about to be fired, was in Djibouti, having been banished to a tour of “s-hole” countries in Africa. He pretended a meeting was fine but just this week, Tillerson warned of leaders who push “alternative realities” when “America\'s future [should] be fact-based—not based on wishful thinking, not hoped-for outcomes made in shallow promises."\xa0Trump’s wishful thinking got wall-to-wall coverage, his gauge of success. The summit not only cut into time spent on the porn star, but also time for other scandals, like EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt living large in a lobbyist’s townhouse, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin making up an award to justify an all-expense paid European vacation with his wife, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s $139,000 door, and everyone, it seemed, flying everywhere like royalty. In the glow, Trump came to believe he could bring peace to Asia before Jared Kushner brought it to the Middle East. Maybe he would win a Nobel Peace Prize. “People were saying so,” he claimed at a recent campaign rally. That would show Obama.\xa0But then reality set in. With\xa0June 12\xa0in Singapore looming large, diplomats had to get down to brass tacks. They could no longer pretend Trump had gotten anything substantive in exchange for Kim getting a U.S president to grant him an audience. Kim reiterated his position that denuclearization was not on the table. The White House pretended this was "fully expected.”\xa0 Trump said only, “We’ll see what happens.”\xa0\xa0In the meantime, Kim’s threat wasn’t without a silver lining. At\xa0Wednesday\xa0morning’s pool spray, it dominated the questions. Rather than being bombarded with questions about a $500 million loan to a Trump-branded golf course in Indonesia after Trump said sanctioned Chinese phone company ZTE should be “put back in business fast,” he was asked about Kim’s reversal—not a welcome turn of events but less toxic than putative bribery.In another substitution of one story for another, Trump turned uproar over a hateful insult out of the White House aimed at Sen. John McCain into one about an investigation into “the traitors and cowards” who leaked it. Aide Kelly Sadler told the communications team not to bother coming up with a strategy to counter McCain’s opposition to the nominee to head the CIA because “It doesn’t matter. He’s dying anyway.” Why wouldn’t Sadler think she could dance on the deathbed of a Navy pilot tortured in a Vietnamese prison for five years with impunity when Trump called McCain a chump for getting himself captured while he, Trump, was enduring his own Vietnam protecting himself from STD’s? Neither has publicly apologized.\xa0Everyone thought that would change at a lunch\xa0Tuesday\xa0with Senate Republicans, five of whom had already castigated Trump. McCain could go rogue, but he is one of them, admired by most, beloved by many. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had just returned from a long trip to Sedona, Arizona to see him one last time. But by the time Trump sat down to lunch, McCain had become a sidebar to Trump’s hunt for the real leaker, or leakers, with security officials with high-tech gear searching staffers for forbidden cell phones. Though senators found time to lavish Trump with praise and ask him not to jeopardize the mid-terms with a government shutdown, not one brought up McCain.\xa0\xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'What Else Does Stormy Daniels Have on Trump?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The first time Stormy Daniels was threatened over her alleged affair with President Trump, she was in a Las Vegas parking lot with her baby daughter. A stranger approached the porn star in the weeks after she spoke to In Touch magazine in May 2011 about her romp with the reality TV star, according to Daniels’ hotly anticipated CBS 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper.Daniels said she was heading to a fitness class and collecting a diaper bag from the back seat of her car when the man warned, “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.” Before he walked off, the creep said, “That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.”Daniels, 39, told Cooper she never saw the man again. “But I—if I did I would know it right away,” she said in the Sunday evening program. “If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know” his face, she added.The adult film actress—who is suing to void a “hush agreement” about her alleged affair with Trump—said she was too afraid to go to police.The interview marked the first time Daniels spoke publicly, on national television, about what led to the infamous “hush agreement.”But the segment left burning questions unanswered, including whether Daniels has text messages and photographs relating to Trump. (According to Daniels’ NDA, she agreed to hand over any such images and texts. Her attorney, Michael Avenatti, alluded to having pics in a Twitter post last week.)And the program didn’t address why Daniels was paid the very specific and relatively paltry sum of $130,000 for her cooperation. For his part, Cooper grilled the porn star about why she was speaking out to set the record straight, even as she risked a million-dollar fine. “The program didn’t address why Daniels was paid the very specific and relatively paltry sum of $130,000 for her cooperation.”In court papers, Trump’s legal team has claimed Daniels owes Cohen and/or Trump $20 million in damages, or $1 million per breach of the NDA.“I guess I’m not 100 percent sure on why you’re doing this,” Cooper told Daniels. “Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself,” she replied. She added that she’s “not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

She was never paid.And she apparently kept quiet after the warning in Las Vegas.Five years later, Cohen would ultimately pay Daniels $130,000 for her silence. Cohen has denied threatening Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who’s made life hell for the White House in recent months. Still, Daniels would allegedly face threats to keep quiet again—after The Wall Street Journal revealed she signed a nondisclosure agreement about her romp with Trump 11 days before the presidential election.Daniels said her former attorney and former manager pressured her to sign statements, which Cohen released to the media, denying the Trump affair.“If it was untruthful, why did you sign it?” Cooper asked. Daniels replied: “Because they made it sound like I had no choice.” There was no threat of physical violence, Daniels added, but she believed she would face legal troubles. “‘I was concerned for my family and their safety,’ Daniels said.”“As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was, ‘They can make your life hell in many different ways,’” Daniels told Cooper. When Cooper asked who “they” was, Daniels replied, “I’m not exactly sure who ‘they’ were. I believe it to be Michael Cohen.”Before the 2016 election, people offered Daniels “large amounts of money” to spill on her tryst with Trump, she said. “Was I tempted?” Daniels told Cooper. “Yes, I struggle with it. And then I get the call. ‘I think I have the best deal for you.’” Daniels’ former lawyer told her Cohen was willing to pay for her secrecy, she said. She signed the agreement because it would protect her child from the news. “I was concerned for my family and their safety,” Daniels said, echoing one friend’s statements to The Daily Beast on why she took the money.When Cooper suggested viewers would have doubts, Daniels said the small payout she accepted proves her story isn’t about the money. “I think the fact that I didn’t even negotiate, I just quickly said yes to this v—very, you know, strict contract. And what most people will agree with me extremely low number. It’s all the proof I need,” Daniels said. She continued, “I turned down a large payday multiple times because one, I didn’t wanna kiss and tell and be labeled all the things that I’m being labeled now.”Plus, she didn’t want her family exposed to the media frenzy. Daniels said that “everything that I was afraid of coming out has come out anyway, and guess what? I don’t have a million dollars.” She laughed, “You didn’t even buy me breakfast.”Daniels declined to answer when Cooper asked whether she turned over any Trump-related video images, pictures, emails, and texts when she signed the NDA.“You don’t want to say one way or the other if you have text messages or other items?” Cooper asked. “My attorney has recommended that I don’t discuss those things,” Daniels said. “‘You don’t want to say one way or the other if you have text messages or other items?’ Cooper asked.”But the interview was as much about Cohen as it was about Daniels. Trevor Potter, a former Federal Election Commission chairman, told 60 Minutes that Cohen’s hush money appeared to be an illegal campaign contribution.“It’s a $130,000 in-kind contribution by Cohen to the Trump campaign, which is about $126,500 above what he’s allowed to give,” said Potter, who helms the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “And if he does this on behalf of his client, the candidate, that is a coordinated, illegal, in kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election, of benefiting the candidate by keeping this secret,” Potter added. Potter said that if Trump repaid Cohen, Trump should have reported the reimbursement. But even if Cohen was repaid, he violated contribution limits. “I guess it mitigates it if he’s paid back by the candidate because the candidate could have paid for it without limit,” Potter told Cooper.And if Trump never repaid Cohen—as Cohen claimed to The New York Times—“Then he is still out on the line, having made an illegal in kind contribution to the campaign,” Potter said. “You’re saying this is more serious for Michael Cohen if the president did not pay him back?” Cooper asked, to which Potter replied in the affirmative. Cohen has said the hush money had nothing to do with the election. Yet Avenatti, Daniels’ attorney, questioned why Cohen didn’t make a deal with the porn star months or years earlier.“Daniels’ former attorney had FedEx-ed her signed NDA to Cohen at his work office in Trump Tower.”“So why didn’t he?” Avenatti told Cooper in his own interview. “It just slipped his mind? It’s just a coincidence that, in the waning days of the campaign, he thought to himself, ‘Oh, you know, I know I’ve been thinkin’ about this for years. Perhaps now is a good time to get that NDA executed with Stormy Daniels.” Avenatti pointed to Cohen’s use of his Trump Organization email on documents relating to the Daniels payout. He also revealed that Daniels’ former attorney had FedEx-ed her signed NDA to Cohen at his work office in Trump Tower. “This idea that there’s a separation now between Mr. Cohen, individually, and the Trump Organization, or Mr. Cohen, individually, and Donald Trump, it—it—it’s nonsense,” Avenatti told Cooper. Cohen did not return messages left by The Daily Beast on Sunday evening.After Sunday’s episode aired, Avenatti addressed the alleged threat to Daniels in 2011 and insinuated Trump’s team was behind it.“There can be no question where this threat came from. It could only have come from one place,” Avenatti hinted on Twitter.Meanwhile, Potter said the FEC isn’t the only problem Trump could face.Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, has also reportedly looked into dealings involving Cohen.Potter said Cohen’s actions unrelated to Russia could be of interest to Mueller, too. The Justice Department “has determined that looking at what [Paul] Manafort did in other contexts is relevant to the investigation. And I think you can say exactly the same thing about Cohen,” Potter said. Mueller has filed a litany of criminal charges against Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, some of which aren’t related to the Russia probe. “[Cohen] was involved indisputably with Trump Organization activities with Russia and negotiations with the Russians,” Potter added. “Mr. Cohen is in the middle of a place that’s of great interest to the special counsel.”Potter then noted another politician who was prosecuted for an undisclosed campaign contribution: former Sen. John Edwards. The North Carolina pol was accused of using campaign cash cover up an extramarital affair—and love child—before the 2008 presidential election.Potter said Cohen’s case is more damaging, however, as the payout came in the days leading to Election Day, and as allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump became a national controversy. “‘Mr. Cohen is in the middle of a place that’s of great interest to the special counsel.’”The 60 Minutes episode ended with Daniels defending her intentions. Cooper questioned why the X-rated actress would deny her affair with Trump in three different statements after her NDA was exposed this year.“But come on. You would not sign statements one, two, three times about something which you knew to be a lie,” Cooper told her attorney.Avenatti replied, “If the president of the United States’ fixer made it clear to me, either directly or indirectly, that I needed to sign it, and I was in the position of Stormy Daniels, I might sign those statements.”Daniels said she felt “intimidated” and “bullied” and “didn’t know what to do.”“And so I signed it,” Daniels continued. “Even though I had repeatedly expressed that I wouldn’t break the agreement, but I was not comfortable lying.”Cooper then asked Daniels, “How do we know you’re telling the truth?”Daniels replied that she had no reason to lie and is potentially putting herself in danger by coming forward. She suggested that writing a book or making bank off her rendezvous with the future president wasn’t a guarantee. She said she could be “shunned” and “be alienating half of my fan base right at this very moment.”Cooper highlighted the statements of another famed porn actress, Jenna Jameson, who recently blasted Daniels’ media campaign and called it “career suicide.”“The left looks at her as a whore and just uses her to try to discredit the president. The right look at her like a treacherous rat. It’s a lose-lose. Should have kept her trap shut,” Jameson tweeted in January.Daniels told Cooper, “I think that she has a lotta wisdom in those words.”Last week, when a Twitter user asked Jameson what she thought about Daniels’ case, she replied, “I think it’s another unimportant distraction.”And on Sunday, Jameson tweeted, “I’m just glad I’m getting rest from being called a whore today” with the hashtag #StormyDanielsDay.Cooper ended the segment by asking what Daniels would say to Trump if he’s watching her 60 Minutes report.She replied, “He knows I’m telling the truth.”"},
 {'title': 'The Damage of Trump’s Low-Bar Presidency Is Worse Than You Think',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "We are so distracted every day by the latest Trump scandal that it becomes hard to recognize the collective damage being done by his presidency. It’s not just the breaking of the norms. It’s is the massive lowering of expectations that people will have in their politicians and their governing institutions.\xa0Take this past week. We were told three different story lines on one separate story after it was revealed—in a wholly separate matter—that Trump had dictated that glowing 2015 health report from his doctor. But it’s more than just the misdirection and mistruths. It’s the cynicism that accompanies them. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) now says the Department of Veterans Affairs is unmanageable. “I’m not sure anyone can run the VA,” he confessed, as the nomination of Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson to head the department teetered in the balance. “It’s so big, it’s one of the biggest bureaucracies in the federal government.” Meanwhile, President Trump says he thought the job would be easier and that nobody knew how complicated health care would be. He has, in short order, created The Low-Bar Presidency, an administration in which we have grown to expect that the spokespeople mislead, that Cabinet officials are corrupt, and that the commander in chief is learning on the job. Most of us are shocked in real time. But the existential question is whether the Low-Bar Presidency ends when Trump’s tenure does. Or will our expectations forever be lowered because of what he has managed to do less than 18 months into office? Will we assume, from here on out, that our politicians lie so cavalierly to us? That they misuse our taxpayer funds for the betterment of their private lives? That they are incapable of meeting the challenges of governance? If so, the costs could be horrifying. A population that believes its elected representatives will fail them will stop demanding success, or truth, or competence, or ethics. We won’t throw the bums out. We’ll grow accustomed to living with them. We’ve been through a crisis of confidence before—as recently as the 1970s. “Americans heard for years that the presidency had grown too complex for one person to manage, that the office had been crippled,” Time magazine’s Lance Morrow recalled in 1986, before adding that, “Reagan seems to slide through a presidential day with ease.” But since the Gipper rode off into the sunset, we have reverted to form. Just last year, Jeremi Suri’s book, The Impossible Presidency: The Rise and Fall of America’s Highest Office, made this same argument. In the May 2018 edition of The Atlantic, John Dickerson did the same:. “No one man—or woman—can possibly represent the varied, competing interests of 327 million citizens,” he wrote.Instead of giving presidents a pass for poor leadership, perhaps we should examine how one man did defy the doomsayers. As Morrow wrote, the fundamental reason Reagan defied the odds is simple: “Reagan seems to derive his strength from the fact that he does exactly what he says he will do.”“He told the air-traffic controllers what he would do, for example, and when they persisted in their strike, he fired them and made it stick. All that has a tonic effect,” wrote Morrow.

Whether it’s DACA or TPP or gun control—or sitting down with Robert Mueller or reimbursing Michael Cohen—he consistently has a casual relationship with the truth. Either that, or “his truth” keeps changing. If it feels like a form of psychological manipulation, that’s because it is. As conservative commentator Amanda Carpenter’s new book argues, Trump is “Gaslighting America.” We’ve had our share of liars and incompetents in the Oval Office, but never before have we had a president so masterful at psychologically manipulating us and making us question our own perception of reality. “The difference is that Clinton and Nixon used gaslighting to try and create this alternative reality as a defensive measure when they were caught doing something wrong,” Carpenter explains. “Trump is different on an extreme level because he does it\xa0offensively.”The end result is a public that doesn’t trust its government to tell the truth—or have confidence that it can properly function. It is the Low-Bar Presidency. And not only does it rejigger our expectations and change our level of tolerance for this kind of behavior in real time, it also invites the next president (regardless of party) to act this way too down the road. Call it normalizing bad behavior, or creating permission structure, if you will. We have broken the seal; the genie is out of the bottle."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Faced with mounting concerns from the Republican Party that former coal executive Don Blankenship could win a crucial U.S. Senate primary in West Virginia on Tuesday, President Trump tweeted that voters should stay away from the man who served a year in jail after being found culpable in the deaths of 29 miners during a 2010 explosion. “To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference,” Trump tweeted. “Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State... No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!”The president of course was referencing when Judge Roy Moore won the Alabama Senate primary last year, only to lose in a historic upset to now-sitting Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL). Blankenship shrugged off the tweet in a statement to reporters, saying Trump “is a very busy man and he doesn’t know me and he doesn’t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.”“The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the president’s agenda,” Blankenship continued. “Tomorrow, West Virginia will send the swamp a message—no one, I mean no one, will tell us how to vote. As some have said, I am Trumpier than Trump and this morning proves it.” '},
 {'title': 'Kremlin Used NRA to Help Trump in 2016, Senate Report Says',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Senate Judiciary Committee said Wednesday that the Russian government apparently used the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. Documents suggest the Kremlin used the NRA to offer the campaign a back channel to Moscow—including a potential meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin—and might have secretly funded Trump’s campaign, the committee said. One of the Russians named in the report even bragged she was part of the Trump campaign’s communications with Russia, The Daily Beast reported last year. The NRA spent a record $30 million on Trump and the FBI is reportedly investigating whether any of the money came from Russia. U.S. law prohibits foreign money to be spent on elections.Two Russian nationals figure prominently in the alleged scheme: Alexander Torshin, deputy governor of the Kremlin’s central bank, and his then-deputy Maria Butina. Torshin met Donald Trump Jr. at the NRA’s 2016 convention in Kentucky and hosted an NRA delegation in Moscow in 2015. Torshin was previously accused by Spanish investigators of laundering money for Russian mobsters, an allegation he denied. (Last month he was sanctioned by the U.S.)Butina founded a pro-gun group in Russia before coming to the United States in 2015 when she immediately began ingratiating herself in conservative circles. Butina started a business with NRA member and GOP activist Paul Erickson. In May 2016, the same month Torshin met Trump Jr. at the NRA convention, Erickson emailed a Trump advisor about setting up a meeting between the candidate and Putin.“Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” he wrote, according to the New York Times. “He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election.”The judiciary committee’s report was released on the same day the Senate intelligence committee broke with Republicans on the House intelligence committee and said Russia clearly favored Trump in the 2016 election.'},
 {'title': 'Don Blankenship Is Rising as the Republican Party Sinks',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Seriously? Don Blankenship can win that GOP Senate primary in West Virginia? It sure looks possible. I doubt we’d see Donald Trump tweeting what he tweeted Monday morning, begging the state’s Republican voters to steer clear of Blankenship, if the Republicans weren’t afraid that he could win. In response, Blankenship went anti-swamp more than anti-Trump. Swampy Republicans were “misinforming” the president, whose agenda Blankenship would support in the Senate. In fact, said Blankenship, he is “Trumpier than Trump.”How can this be happening? The guy spent a year in prison related to the deaths of 29 men in the worst coal disaster in the county in 40 years. What has it come to, that voters could do this? Of course even if he does win, it’s just the party nomination, not a Senate seat—yet. But we can no longer say anything’s impossible. I remember the geniuses who said Donald Trump becoming president was impossible. I was one of them.I grew up in West Virginia, and I know—or knew, once upon a time—its politics very well. When I was a kid it was a fairly liberal state. For something else I’m writing, I just happened the other day to go look up the roll call votes on the civil rights and voting rights acts of 1964 and 1965. All five of the state’s House representatives (then; it only has three now) voted for both. The Southernization of the state started in the 1980s as the number of union jobs decreased and social issues came to the fore. That crescendoed in 2000, when George W. Bush beat Al Gore there. It was a surprise to the national pundits but not to me. The state was pretty conservative already by then.The main issue was coal, and one of the people who led the charge to the right was Blankenship, lavishing money on Republican candidates for the state legislature and most controversially the state Supreme Court. Slowly, the Democrats—except Joe Manchin—were beaten. By the time of the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in April 2010, it was pretty much a one-party state.But this of course goes well beyond one-partyism. It’s not as if the other two Republicans running aren’t right wing. They’re way over there. But one’s in Congress, and the other is the state attorney general. They’re swamp creatures. Voting for them isn’t a big enough middle finger to society, evidently.Davitt McAteer is a lawyer in Shepherdstown in the eastern panhandle and a mine-safety hero. In the West Virginia I grew up in, he was recognized and honored as such. He’s been investigating mining disasters since Farmington 1968, which I remember as a kid (that’s Joe Manchin’s hometown, incidentally). \xa0He led one of the investigations into the Upper Big Branch disaster. He says the story Blankenship is peddling now, about the disaster being the fault of the government, is a top-to-bottom lie. “His assertion,” McAteer says, “is simply scientifically wrong.”McAteer walked me through the specific issues at hand—the levels of methane in the mine and the ventilation issues that helped cause the explosion. In sum, he said, the mine was relying on a system of “trap doors” that had to be opened and closed at the right times to ventilate the mine, a technology that McAteer says is 100 years old. Inspectors warned about this. And now Blankenship is blaming the inspectors. “Inspectors did a great job of trying to create and keep ventilation,” McAteer says. “He did not operate the mine in a safe way.”West Virginia has been beaten and battered. There’s not much life in the southern part of the state. I have a friend who told me that he’d heard of people moving out of the state who were unable to sell their houses, just left them. You read all the time about men who used to make $70,000 or $80,000 with overtime now working three jobs to make $25,000. For many, this happened in the last seven or eight years, when the natural-gas market leveled coal.So Blankenship, who’s been out of the game since the 2010 disaster, “has successfully pointed out that he created jobs and that in his absence these jobs have ceased to exist,” McAteer says. “It’s not true, but it doesn’t matter. If you’re a guy who’s out of work and you hear that, maybe it makes a certain sense to you.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Maybe they are to some extent. But I think it’s more emotional. We’ve seen it before. What made Alabama Republicans nominate an accused pederast? Anger at the establishment. You call Roy Moore a perv? Well, if you hate him, that’s good enough for me, they said. I’m for him. Same with Blankenship. Same, for that matter, with Trump.If Blankenship wins tonight, where does this stop? Because this is not a West Virginia thing. This is a GOP thing. Who’s next, an actual murderer? As long as he just killed a liberal, and not a “real” American, why not?And I’m sure Manchin will be happy if Blankenship wins, as well he should be. The other two candidates are far more serious competition on paper. But then again Hillary Clinton thought that about Trump. "},
 {'title': 'Former Cambridge Analytica Guru Christopher Wylie Claps Back at Critics: I Am a Genuine Whistleblower',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'LONDON—The former Cambridge Analytica data guru who came forward to claim that the Trump political consultants had misused 50 million Facebook profiles in the 2016 presidential election has hit back at critics questioning his status as a genuine whistleblower.Christopher Wylie said the prospect of being “crushed” by billionaire Republican backer Robert Mercer prevented him from coming forward sooner.Since Wylie went public, Facebook shares have tanked, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica has been suspended, and U.S., British, and European authorities have launched inquiries into the use of personal data in the 2016 campaigns.Wylie believes the data analytics and targeted online campaigns he helped to pioneer at Cambridge Analytica were intrinsic to the campaigns that upturned the political world in 2016—first through Brexit and then the election of Donald Trump.The Daily Beast asked Wylie why he had not blown the whistle before it was too late to stop Brexit and Trump. “I didn’t fully appreciate the impact of what I helped create until 2016 happened,” he said. “Very soon after that, I started working for The Guardian, originally as an anonymous source.”Wylie began communicating with investigative reporter Carole Cadwalladr a few months after Trump’s shock election victory. He said he went to the authorities first and then began to leak information about the work of Cambridge Analytica by the spring of 2017.“Firstly, we should be encouraging people who know about wrongdoing—even if they were involved in it—we should be encouraging those people to come forward,” he said. “Secondly, I didn’t come forward because I got sued almost immediately after leaving [in late 2014] and I had to sign not just an NDA but an undertaking of confidence, and it was quite intimidating to go up against Robert Mercer, who’s a billionaire who threatens to crush you.”Mercer, who was Trump’s biggest backer in the race against Hillary Clinton, is a major investor in Cambridge Analytica but has never been on its board, and a source told The Daily Beast this month that he was just a passive investor while his daughter Rebekah has a more hands-on role and a place on the board.Wylie told The Daily Beast that it wasn’t Rebekah Mercer, whom he said he met several times, who paid close attention to the data scraping and voter targeting tools Cambridge Analytica was using. “No, that was Robert Mercer. Robert Mercer was interested in what we were doing—in terms of the actual technical processes,” he said. “Rebekah Mercer just wanted stuff to happen. She is a difficult and demanding woman to work for.”Wylie said that after Trump’s election, which came almost two years after he had left Cambridge Analytica, the first action he took was to report himself and the company to the authorities in Britain, where he lives.“The other thing that I did is I went and talked to other people I know to gather evidence,” he said. “That took months and months and months, and I promise you that was very difficult to do because when you talk to someone who has been intimidated over and over and over again by a billionaire and by Steve Bannon, it is hard to convince them to risk trusting someone else with information that could be incredibly compromising to them.”'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Pro-Trump YouTube duo Diamond & Silk appeared Thursday on Capitol Hill to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. It didn’t take them long to make false statements.The flamboyant duo—whose real names are Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson—became a cause célèbre among conservative lawmakers at this month’s Facebook hearings. Allegations that they were censored by the social-media site received more attention than serious, global issues—among them, genocide—related to the site.After repeated grilling from Republican lawmakers on the alleged blocking of Diamond & Silk content, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg apologized for “an enforcement error” and said the website had reached out to the duo to resolve the situation. The pro-Trump pair claimed they never heard from Facebook, but email and social-media evidence emerged proving them wrong.On Thursday, the duo themselves came before Congress for a separate hearing. And moments after swearing an oath, they repeated the false censorship claim, replying in the affirmative when asked if their content was “blocked” by Facebook. "Facebook censored our free speech!" Diamond shouted, before alleging that President Trump is the biggest victim of alleged social-media censorship.Then the duo proceeded to make even more blatantly false statements.Diamond claimed that she and Silk have “never been paid by the Trump campaign.” But Federal Election Commission documents show exactly the opposite. In November 2016, the pair were given $1,274.94 for, what was recorded as, “field consulting.”When confronted with those receipts by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the duo snarled back: “We are familiar with that particular lie. We can see that you do fall for fake news.”Jeffries reminded the pair that they were under oath, and asked, “Who is lying here?”The pair claimed in separate moments that either the FEC made a mistake in its documentation, or that the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, may have reimbursed them for air travel to stump for Trump. At one point, Diamond accused Jeffries, who is also black, of racial motivations for interrogating them over the campaign funds.Members of the committee were seen holding back laughter as Diamond & Silk engaged in shouting matches with multiple Democratic lawmakers. “This is a stupid and ridiculous hearing," Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) eventually declared.'},

  'body': 'In his new book, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) defends his decision to give a controversial dossier about President Trump to former FBI chief James Comey.“I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as ‘the dossier,’” McCain writes in the upcoming book, titled The Restless Wave, referencing information compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. “I reviewed its contents. The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation’s security should have done.” The Daily Beast obtained an advance copy of the book, due out May 22.McCain writes that in November 2016, he spoke with Sir Andrew Wood, a former British diplomat, at the Halifax International Security Forum. Wood alerted him to Steele’s work after which, David Kramer, senior director for Human Rights and Human Freedoms at the McCain Institute, traveled to London to meet with Steele. Prior to this, as The Washington Post reported, Steele had already met with American officials in Rome to discuss his findings. The Arizona Republican had previously issued a statement in January of 2017 about passing over "sensitive information" to Comey.McCain recounts how he put the dossier in a safe in his office and called Comey’s office to request a meeting: “I went to see him at his earliest convenience, handed him the dossier, explained how it had come into my possession.“I said I didn’t know what to make of it, and I trusted the FBI would examine it carefully and investigate its claims. With that, I thanked the director and left. The entire meeting had probably not lasted longer than ten minutes. I did what duty demanded I do,” McCain concludes.In other sections of the book, previously viewed by The Daily Beast and other outlets, the Arizona senator reflects on his life and in some parts harshly criticizes Trump. “He has declined to distinguish the actions of our government from the crimes of despotic ones,” McCain writes. “The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values.”'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A Republican running for governor of Georgia is bringing his racist “Deportation Bus Tour” to Cracker Barrel restaurants—and Cracker Barrel isn't having it.Michael Williams, a Georgia state senator, is currently polling dead last in the state’s Republican primary. With the primary next week, Williams is trying to rally racists by hosting a “Deportation Bus Tour” from a converted school bus plastered with slogans like “FILL THIS BUS WITH ILLEGALS” and “DANGER! MURDERERS, RAPISTS, KIDNAPPERS, CHILD MOLESTORS [sic], AND OTHER CRIMINALS ON BOARD.” The bus tour, which launched this week, has scheduled stops at Georgia restaurants, including at least 10 Cracker Barrels. Those stops are new to Cracker Barrel, which has spent the past two days unsuccessfully telling Williams to buzz off.Williams is a long-time Trump supporter who courts the racist right. Last July, Williams attended a “March Against Sharia” event where he posed with a fringe militia for a picture. Among the group was Alex Ramos, a man who was convicted this month for his role in beating a counter-protester at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia last August.Cracker Barrel is something of an in-joke among some racist circles, which claim, incorrectly, that the restaurant’s name derives from a slang term for white people.In a statement, Cracker Barrel distanced itself from Williams. “We are not sponsoring this event or supporting Mr. Williams’ campaign stops in any way, and per our company policy, we will not allow him – or any political candidate—to host an event on Cracker Barrel’s property,” the company said in a statement. “We take pride in showing our communities and our country that the hospitality we practice is indeed welcoming and inclusive to all.”A spokesperson for Williams answered The Daily Beast’s phone call, asked to call back in five minutes, and never did.Williams isn’t banned from Cracker Barrel, per se.“If he wants to come in and eat, that’s fine,” Janella Escobar director of Cracker Barrel’s corporate communications told The Daily Beast in a Thursday phone call. But she said Williams’ campaign had been mum when Cracker Barrel tried informing them of their policy against campaigns.“We’ve tried repeatedly for the past two days to be in contact with him,” Escobar said. “We’ve tried his cell phone, his campaign’s email, to no avail. He did not ask permission to come onto our properties and host these events.”Other businesses listed as stops on Williams’ tour website said they were uninvolved.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“It is not our intent as a business to participate in political debates or campaigns,” Cabin Coffee Co., a Blairsville, Georgia coffee shop wrote in a Thursday Facebook post. Like Cracker Barrel, the coffee shop said Williams’ campaign was not responding.“Yesterday I left a voice mail message, sent an email and then ‘messaged’ on their facebook page this morning,” a representative for Cabin Coffee Co. told The Daily Beast over Facebook messenger. “I have not received a response.”Another restaurant on tour, Brian’s Buffet in Griffin, Georgia issued a one-sentence statement on its Facebook page.“We do not support Micheal Williams running for governor and he is banned from the parking lot,” the statement read.Seth Weathers, a spokesperson for Williams’ campaign said the bus tour is within its rights to host events outside the restaurants. “As far as I know, it’s still a free country, and if we want to stop and get a bite to eat at one of these places, I don’t think there’s any problem with that,” Weathers told The Daily Beast. “I understand we can’t throw a party in the parking lot.”When asked about the Williams campaign specifically listing those restaurants as tour stops, Weathers claimed those restaurants had signs outside catering to tour buses.“I’ve never even heard of the place or seen it,” he said when informed that Brian’s Buffet had specifically banned Williams’ tour from the parking lot.So far, Williams’ bus tour has been marked by protests from people who want him there even less than the restaurants do. On Wednesday, the first day of the tour, Williams allegedly threatened the throng of protesters who far outnumbered his supporters.“Williams threatened to have protesters arrested and run over with his bus, while one of his supporters hit a protester with an umbrella, while an associate of the tour destroyed protesters signs,” activist news site It’s Going Down reported.“That was not the case, but I find it very humorous,” Weathers said. “He did not make a threat, is my point, and there’s clearly not any proof of that or anything else, other than, I guess, a crazy person running around saying that Williams made a threat.”"},

  'body': 'Democrats are increasingly concerned that their opportunity to flip three key California congressional districts could be thwarted by the state’s jungle primaries. In California, candidates of either party compete in the same primary and then the top two vote-getters move on to the general election. Worries over a potential lockout—where the top two finishers are somehow not Democrats—were on display Tuesday as two major liberal groups invested in districts respectively represented by retiring Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), incumbent Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and retiring Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA). Priorities USA Action and the House Majority PAC announced they will launch a $270,000 digital ad campaign beginning Tuesday and running through the June 5 primary. The ads, targeting Republicans running in those districts, will run on Facebook, Google, YouTube, and non-skippable videos on the Fox News website. They will specifically focus on the candidacies of Scott Baugh in the 48th district, Shawn Nelson in the 39th district, and Rocky Chavez in the 49th district.“As Democrats work to retake the House this November, we need to make sure that we’re maximizing our opportunities to win, which, in California, means ensuring at least one Democrat makes it onto the general election ballot,”\xa0Patrick McHugh, Executive Director of Priorities USA Action said in a statement. “Southern California voters deserve to have all of the facts before they cast their ballots, especially with such a crowded field of candidates. Priorities and HMP will be communicating with voters online from now until primary day to help ensure Democratic success in these races.”This follows an announcement from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) of major broadcast and cable purchases in those districts. Additionally, the DCCC has weighed in by adding Democratic candidate and businessman Harley Rouda to its “Red to Blue” program, providing him with even more resources in his race to replace Rohrabacher. They took a similar tack with Gil Cisneros, a Navy veteran competing for Royce’s seat. “We need to make sure we have a Democrat going in November,” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) told The Daily Beast. “A lot of grassroots organizations and stakeholders have worked very hard and they deserve to have a candidate in November.

 {'title': 'Trump and His Lawyer May Have Conspired to Obstruct Justice If They Dangled Pardons for Manafort and Flynn',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "If President Donald Trump’s lawyer discussed the possibility of pardons with Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, then it could be a whole new piece of the obstruction of justice investigation into the president.On Wednesday, the New York Times and Washington Post reported that last summer, John Dowd talked to the lawyers of the two former Trump campaign advisors about pardons for then-uncharged crimes. Dowd, who resigned as Trump’s lawyer last week, denies the report.\xa0But if true, the report raises the possibility that the pardons were offered to influence the two men if they later faced a decision about whether to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between Russia and the Trump campaign to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.\xa0In fact, of course, both men have now been charged by Mueller, and each has chosen a different course, so far. Flynn, Trump’s former national security advisor, has pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and has agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, has been charged with failing to register as a foreign agent and a variety of related financial crimes, and shows no sign of pleading guilty or cooperating.\xa0If the report is true, then five observations are worth noting:1. Even discussing a pardon is a bad idea.In light of the allegations last summer that Trump may have been obstructing the Russia investigation when he asked FBI Director Jim Comey to let the investigation into Flynn go and then fired Comey, most lawyers would scrupulously avoid any act that might even hint at obstruction of justice. Discussing the possibility of a pardon could at the very least create the appearance of an attempt to tamper with witnesses in the Russia investigation. The reported conversations occurred after Mueller was appointed to serve as special counsel and after a grand jury had been empaneled, and everyone involved the conversation would have known that the risk of indictment of Flynn and Manafort was very real. Even if Dowd’s intentions were solely to reward Trump aides for their past service to the President, discussing pardons with potential witnesses at that point was reckless because of the unlawful impression it could make, putting Trump at greater risk of being charged with obstruction of justice.\xa02. You don’t discuss pardons unless you want something in exchange.Because discussing pardons looks so bad, it seems unlikely that Dowd would have done so unless he thought it was unavoidable, either because Trump insisted or because he thought it was essential to protecting Trump. As a matter of law, it is not necessary to discuss a pardon with the recipient before it can be granted. If Trump wanted to pardon Flynn and Manafort, he could just do so on his own. One reason to discuss a pardon with them is to extract some thing of value in exchange, such as a promise not to cooperate with Mueller. Could such an arrangement explain Manafort’s persistence in maintaining his innocence, even after his co-conspirator Richard Gates has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate against him?\xa03. A president’s pardon power is absolute—unless used corruptly.Some have argued that the President’s power to pardon federal offense is absolute, so there is nothing wrong with discussing it with anyone he wants. While the President does indeed have the power of the pardon, as with all powers, he may not use it corruptly. For example, the President also has the power to appoint cabinet secretaries and federal judges, but he may not so in exchange for bribes. Similarly, the President may grant pardons as expressions of mercy to those who show remorse for their crimes or for any other legitimate reason, but he may not grant pardons to silence would-be witnesses against himself or his associates.\xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

It is likely that Trump was aware of the offer.If Dowd discusses pardons with Flynn and Manafort, it seems very unlikely that he did so without consulting with Trump. A lawyer has an ethical duty to communicate with his client, and to keep him reasonably informed about the matter that is the subject of the representation. In light of the significance of pardons in these cases, it seems that Dowd had an obligation to discuss his strategy with Trump. A lawyer with Dowd’s experience would certainly know this. The chance that Trump did not know about it is close to zero percent.\xa05. Dowd could be in legal trouble.Mueller would need to know more details about the report from those with knowledge before making any charging decisions, but Dowd may be at legal risk. The key issue is whether Dowd had a corrupt intent in talking with Flynn and Manafort about pardons. To determine intent, jurors are typically instructed to draw reasonable inferences based on their common sense in light of the totality of the circumstances — what the person said and did. Here, what Dowd said and did will matter, but the mere fact that he discussed pardons with two potential witnesses from Trump’s inner circle contribute to a reasonable inference of a corrupt purpose. If Dowd and Trump agreed to offer pardons in an effort to silence Flynn and Manafort, they could be charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice. The attorney-client privilege generally protects communications between a lawyer and his client made for the purpose of seeking legal advice, but the privilege yields to what is known as the crime-fraud exception when the lawyer engages in criminal activity with his client. Prosecutors are often reluctant to charge a lawyer for conduct that occurred during the course is his representation, but Mueller has shown some willingness to go after lawyers in this investigation, charging attorney Alex van der Zwaan with making false statements and compelling Manafort’s lawyer to testify before the grand jury. Could Dowd be next? "},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen Has Become a Trumpworld Pariah: ‘Time to Keep a Distance’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In March, Michael Cohen’s lawyer went on NBC to declare with “100 percent” certainty that President Donald Trump had not reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payment to Trump’s alleged porn star mistress. The president has now officially confirmed that that was not the case.The now-refuted claim by Cohen’s lawyer, David Schwartz, illustrated the potential pitfalls for allies of Cohen and his one-time client, the president, in publicly defending Cohen in the face of a rapidly escalating scandal. What began as a controversy over a six-figure payment to silence the president’s alleged mistress during the 2016 campaign has ballooned into to a far larger scandal involving the sale of Trump administration access to corporate clients with business before the federal government, and even foreign state actors accused of seeking to bribe top White House officials.Schwartz continues to serve as Cohen’s spokesman in addition to his attorney. But his TV appearances have receded since late March, leaving the task of defending Cohen to White House allies and surrogates who are increasingly wary of being forced to stick up for the man at the center of the biggest Trumpworld scandal since the Russia investigation.Michael Cohen, in short, has become a Trumpworld pariah.Senior White House officials habitually dodge questions on Cohen, his predicament, and its potential consequences for the president, instead referring related questions to attorneys representing Cohen and Trump. Officials privately wish that President Trump never talked or tweeted publicly about his personal lawyer—which, true to form, is a wish the president has refused to grant.Two prominent allies of the president, who also know Cohen well, told The Daily Beast they’ve begun ignoring or declining requests from cable news bookers to discuss Cohen on-air. “It’s time to keep a distance,” one of these people said. Numerous other Trump associates, veterans of the 2016 campaign or presidential transition, and White House surrogates said they’re avoiding any phone contact with Cohen out of concern that his line might be tapped, and that direct interaction could involve them in the scandal that has enveloped Cohen and the influence-peddling operation he set up in the wake of Trump’s election victory.The feds, Trump allies say, are treating Cohen as if he were a sketchy mafia lawyer. The White House wants nothing to do with him, and begrudges him for imperiling the Trump presidency with his antics (whether sanctioned by Trump or not). The president remains privately skeptical that his loyalist pit bull won’t end up snitching on him under a threat of serious jail time. When Trump allies have been pressed to address the Cohen controversy on air, they’ve sidestepped some questions, and used others to try to distance the president and the White House from the embattled former Trump Organization attorney.“Michael Cohen wanted very much to be in politics,” said Roger Stone, a Trump ally and informal adviser, in an appearance on Meet the Press on Sunday. “He wanted to be in the campaign. He wanted to be in the administration. He has not achieved any of those things. I don’t think the president regarded him as a political genius or was open to his desires in that area. And he had a tendency to discount any political advice that Michael would give him.”Asked by host Chuck Todd whether the president should be concerned that Cohen might turn on him, Stone said, “I’ve been in politics for 40 years. I know enough not to answer hypothetical questions.”Among some Trump allies and 2016 campaign veterans, Cohen is seen—or spun—as a hanger-on who attempted to parlay his connections to the president into a lucrative D.C. influence operation despite not having a major role in the campaign or in White House policymaking since then. As a result, few feel an obligation to publicly defend him as he faces down daunting legal and public relations challenges.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“He made a fortune [off of his Trump connections] and has been nothing but a headache,” one Trump campaign veteran told The Daily Beast. For loyalists, Cohen is worth defending only to the extent that his conduct implicates the president. When that conduct involved the payment to Daniels, it might merit some pushback. But on issues surrounding his post-election consulting business, he’s mostly “on his own,” the former campaign official said.Cohen referred The Daily Beast’s questions to his attorney, who did not respond.Even during the campaign, officials felt Cohen was a peripheral player in the president’s orbit who few felt the need to involve in strategizing or decision-making. Another former senior campaign official who was in frequent contact with the campaign’s team’s top executives—Jared Kushner, Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, and others—said, “no one ever asked me to loop in Cohen.”Cohen, that source said, was mockingly referred to at Trump campaign HQ as “the ‘says who?’ guy,” a reference to a cable news interview that Cohen gave during the campaign in which he dodged questioning by simply repeating “says who?” to a seemingly dumbfounded host.Already skeptical of Cohen, many Trump allies have watched warily as association with him has turned toxic. Cohen’s post-election work in Washington has already resulted in early retirements for C-suite executives at two prominent companies, AT&T and Novartis, that enlisted his “shadow-lobbying” services.The controversy stemming from those services continues to grow, as revelations emerge that Cohen was hawking his services not just to major corporations but also to at least one foreign government. As the scandal continues spiraling, Trump allies that once vehemently defended Cohen amid controversy involving his payment to porn star Stormy Daniels have been more muted.Even Sean Hannity, the president’s most vocal cable news advocate, has mostly ignored Cohen since the controversy has evolved from one implicating Trump in potentially illicit payments to Daniels to one more directly related to Cohen’s influence-peddling schemes. Hannity, who devoted a monologue on May 4 to defending Trump from criticism surrounding the Daniels payment, has not directly weighed in on his Fox News show on any subsequent development in the Cohen controversy.In spite of that controversy, Cohen remains a member of the Republican National Committee’s finance leadership team, which he joined shortly after Trump took office. The RNC did not respond to questions about Cohen’s continued role as a fundraiser, and whether he is still participating in RNC events.Cohen does have some defenders, though, among segments of Trumpworld who empathize with his ongoing legal problems and the burdens they create.“As a mere witness in this investigation, I’ve seen clients, colleagues, and friends shy away, and my family has been mercilessly attacked by anonymous and even named individuals threatening violence and death,” Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser and a peripheral figure in the Russia investigations, told The Daily Beast. “But my closest friends and most important clients are standing by me and show no signs of waning in their support.“I can tell you,” Caputo said, “that if Michael Cohen called me today, I’d pick up the phone without hesitation.”—With additional reporting by Andrew Kirell."},

  'body': 'The former editor in chief of the New York Observer is being vetted to join President Donald Trump’s advisory roster.Ken Kurson, a close ally of Trump’s son-in-law and former Observer owner Jared Kushner, confirmed to The Daily Beast that he is being considered for an honorary, unpaid role with the administration. And multiple sources confirmed to The Daily Beast on Friday that the FBI approached them and other people close to Kurson as part of the background vetting process. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Under Kushner’s ownership, Kurson ran the Observer from 2013 until 2017. Kushner transferred his stake in the publication into a family trust upon his father-in-law’s 2016 presidential election victory. And Kurson, also a former Rudy Giuliani speechwriter, stepped down in early 2017 to work for corporate-advisory firm Teneo Strategy.Kurson’s tenure at the Observer came under intense scrutiny for his ties to Kushner and the Trump campaign, which most famously culminated in Kurson having helped write the future president’s March 2016 speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC); and in the Observer giving a full-throated endorsement to Trump’s candidacy, positively comparing him to Ronald Reagan.The moves also infuriated staff, who felt that the editor in chief was not forthcoming about his deep ties to the family and campaign. Staffers publicly criticized leadership including Kurson and Kushner, and some considered resigning en masse in protest of Kurson’s decision to secretly pen the AIPAC speech without disclosing to employees.

 {'title': 'Mueller Team Made a Grab for Paul Manafort’s ‘Privileged’ Docs Before Michael Cohen Raid',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "After Monday’s raid on Michael Cohen’s office, home, and hotel room, President Donald Trump tweeted: “Attorney-client privilege is dead!” That isn’t true. But it is accurate to say that Mueller, his investigators, and the Southern District of New York team that took over the Cohen probe from him have all taken an aggressive approach to their targets’ legal teams. One example, which has not been previously reported, came when Mueller’s investigators raided Paul Manafort’s house in Virginia. Among other items, investigators seized a binder full of information that Manafort and his legal team considered privileged, according to a source familiar with the matter. Manafort’s lawyer wrote a strongly worded letter to the special counsel’s office saying the material was privileged, and the binder was ultimately returned. It isn’t the only example of Mueller taking steps that make defense attorneys extremely nervous. His grand jury brought in one of Manafort’s former lawyers, Melissa Laurenza, for questioning. She had helped Manafort fill out lobbying disclosure forms for the Justice Department. Judge Beryl Howell, who oversees Mueller’s grand jury, issued an opinion finding that attorney-client privilege did not extend to Laurenza because the work she did for Manafort was public and because her communications with Manafort could have been part of a criminal activity. The grand jury also questioned former Manafort spokesperson Jason Maloni, who the law firm WilmerHale had hired to represent him. Mueller also questioned Mark Corallo, formerly a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team. And at least one lawyer will do prison time because of the Mueller probe: Alexander van der Zwaan, who helped write a report for Manafort on then-president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. Though lawyers are generally protected from questioning by zealous prosecutors, there are exceptions—as Michael Cohen learned the hard way. One exception is when the lawyer and his or her client are engaged together in a criminal scheme. The U.S. Attorney’s Manual has a specific section laying out when and why prosecutors can use this exception to demand information about communications between attorneys and their clients. It’s likely this exception is the justification for the raid on Cohen’s office and home. Despite that clearly delineated exception to attorney-client privilege, any time prosecutors question lawyers about their clients it always raises eyebrows. Victoria Toensing, formerly a contender to join the president’s legal team, told The Daily Beast yesterday that the raid was “highly unethical” and an attempt to destroy Trump’s presidency. Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said he found Mueller’s decision to bring Laurenza before the grand jury extremely troubling. “He effectively made Manafort’s own lawyer a witness against her client,” he told The Daily Beast. “I’m still astonished that a federal court allowed that to occur. It was unnecessary given the other evidence that Mueller had. It was exceptionally heavy-handed and was designed to drive a wedge between Manafort and his counsel. It also sent a chilling message to lawyers who are representing people in the Mueller investigation.”But Peter Vincent, an attorney who briefed Mueller when he worked at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia, told The Daily Beast that Mueller’s approach shouldn’t come as a surprise. “Mueller is taking an appropriately muscular approach, however he’s being—as always—extremely cautious in order not to cross any ethical lines whatsoever,” Vincent said. “I think he feels like he can take an aggressive approach because he has done all of the necessary due diligence and has taken the necessary steps to ensure that nothing he is doing crosses any sort of ethical lines.”Michael Wildes, a former federal prosecutor, said while Mueller’s tactics may be tough on his targets, they are necessary.

  'body': "If Hillary Clinton had won the election, she’d be under investigation by Republican Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, for whatever stray scandals he could find, and Democrats would be bracing for a midterm disaster in November, plunging them deeper into the congressional wilderness. \xa0If Clinton were President, nobody would be talking about Democrats maybe taking back the senate majority. The debate would be over how close the Republicans will get to 60 votes, a veto-proof majority, after picking up seats in the midterms. The Democrats’ good fortune hit home for me when MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki poring over his election map said that the best thing that \xa0happened to the 10 Democrats running for reelection to the senate in red states is Donald Trump. With Trump in the White House, Jennifer Duffy with the non-partisan Cook Political Report has moved five (Indiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, West Virginia and Florida) of the 10 red-state senate seats into the toss-up column. . “If Clinton were president, she’d be subject to the midterm curse, where the party in power is destined to lose seats,” says Duffy. “Trey Gowdy would not be retiring, and the House would not be in play.”As for Clinton herself, facing the constant drumbeat of fake scandal and the obstruction of a solidly Republican Congress, she’d likely be a one-term president. Winning a third term for the party in power after a popular two-term president is hard enough; a fourth is an even steeper climb, as George H.W. Bush can attest. New York Times writer Amy Chozick \xa0reports in her new book, “Chasing Hillary,” that when Clinton was told she had lost the 2016 race, she said,\xa0“I knew\xa0it. I knew this would happen to\xa0me. They were\xa0never going to\xa0let me be president.” Pinning down who “they” is gets tricky. There are lots of candidates, including herself, Chozick concludes, as a member of a rapacious media focused on equalizing the flaws between the two major candidates, and then waking up the day after and realizing the consequences of that false equivalency. \xa0The irony is that Clinton, by losing her place as the first woman president, is arguably doing more for her party, and for women’s political aspirations, than if she had made it to the Oval Office. There are a record number of women newly engaged in politics, many of them clones of Clinton—college-educated suburban women energized by Clinton’s loss in a way that her presidency might never have achieved in today’s harsh partisan climate. Democrats enter the midterm cycle with high energy, and a realistic chance to regain a foothold in Washington by taking back the House and maybe even the senate. Clinton has vowed not to be driven out of the arena, and her political group, Onward Together, mentors progressive organizations. She is still in demand among the faithful, but there is grumbling about the fundraising appeals that never cease, and there’s no clamor for her to run again for anything. Yet even as facts emerge about Russian hacking and how it tilted the election against her, Clinton herself is not quite a sympathetic figure. There’s no heartwarming documentary to show what Clinton was up against the way the 2014 documentary “Mitt” offered a behind-the-scenes view of the candidate and his family during the 2012 election, when Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama, coupled with scenes from the 2008 primaries, when Romney lost to John McCain. \xa0\xa0The New York Times called it “a glimpse into the private pain of a highly public failure.” \xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The documentary ends with the couple taking a cab from the airport, sans Secret Service, and Romney carrying their bags into the living room. The defeated candidate comes across as likeable and much more self-aware than the two-dimensional rich guy the country saw. He notes at one point in the film that he spent part of his fortune building the brand of a moderate Republican successfully governing Massachusetts, a blue state, and that brand helped sink his candidacy in ’08 in the increasingly hard right primaries against McCain. “When this is over,” he says, “people will know what I stand for – the flipping Mormon.” Romney is not a heroic figure. He is a shape-shifter when it comes to policy, from his creation of Romneycare in Massachusetts to declaring in 2012 as the Republican nominee that he is “fiercely conservative.” Yet he will almost certainly be the next senator from Utah even if he is at odds with his party’s base. “If you’re a Trump supporter, you should still be for Mitt Romney so the party base doesn’t shrink anymore,” says former GOP Congressman Vin Weber. \xa0Why is Romney being greeted as a returning statesman while Clinton is still something of an outcast? Some of it is gender, though with Clinton even that is skewed by the fact that she has her own category. As Chozick notes in her book, voters would often say they would vote for a woman, but “not that woman.” Clinton has lots of baggage, not all of her own making, and certainly not all fair, while Romney has no baggage in Utah, says Duffy. “He’s not from there, he has a house there, but he’s not from there. They remember him as the person who got the Olympics turned around, and a member in good standing of the church.” His son Josh and his family live in Salt Lake, and Romney is now showing up at Utah Jazz games. “The hope is that he will be a statesmanlike voice able to work across the aisle,” says Duffy. Though Romney failed to get his party’s endorsement at a state convention last month heavily populated by libertarians, he is expected to easily win a June primary and polls show him well ahead of his Democratic rival, Jenny Wilson, who was one of his deputies during his successful leadership of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. She had counted on running against incumbent Orrin Hatch, who decided to retire. Republicans thought Romney should have won against Obama in 2012, but six years later, he’s got absolution and a likely senate seat. Everybody thought Clinton would win in 2016, and come November, the sting of her loss should be partly atoned for with a reversal of fortune for Democrats that could never have happened if she’d been in the White House. \xa0\xa0\xa0"},

He also confirmed that he has been interviewed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, but declined to say whether it was related to that Trump meeting. Though introduced by Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Pat Roberts (R-KS) as honest and candid, CIA Director Mike Pompeo wouldn’t “talk about the conversations the president and I had.” As reported by the Washington Post last June, Trump had asked his intelligence chiefs to get Comey to back off ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn, who subsequently pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Pompeo said the article’s “implication” that Trump asked him “to do anything improper is false.” But when Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) asked what Trump actually asked him to do, Pompeo said, “I don’t recall.” Menendez said that he was troubled by Pompeo’s refusal to answer. The chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Republican Bob Corker, an ally of ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said it was “fair to ask” if Pompeo’s closeness with Trump is “based on deferential willingness to go along to get along.”'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'It was at the end of the unclassified hearing for President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency that Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, switched gears. Having spent much of his time extolling Gina Haspel’s professional credentials, the North Carolina Republican abruptly noted that she was also poised to break the glass ceiling at the CIA. “It may be impossible to measure the importance of that breakthrough but I know that your confirmation will send a signal to the current workforce and the workforce of the future that a lifetime of commitment to the agency and its mission can still and will be rewarded,” Burr said.If confirmed, Haspel would, indeed, make history. But in citing that possibility, Burr wasn\'t just offering commentary about social progress in America, he was taking his turn at using one of the Republican Party\'s new favorite political weapons.The GOP in the Trump years has grown to love identity politics, viewing it as an effective means of waging battles and landing counterpunches. And it’s not just over Haspel. "The only war on women that I see is the one that\'s being waged against every woman and every female that is close to this president," White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Fox News early last year, responding to a question about Ivanka Trump and other women serving on Team Trump. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said in December that “of course I’ve had a #MeToo moment, but nobody cared about that,” because, she suggested, of her conservative political leanings.It’s relatively new terrain for the Republicans, who have traditionally made the case that merit always matters more than gender, race, sexual orientation (unless you are transgender and want to serve in the military). Indeed, for much of the right, the idea that these factors should be part of political considerations has long been derided as a sort of tokenism—an annoying liberal trait rooted in guilt and political correctness. And, for some, it’s proving odd to watch their party flip the script.“It’s all part of the upside down world of American politics, where the only rule is that there are no rules,” said longtime GOP pollster Frank Luntz. “Both parties are saying things and doing things that would’ve been unimaginable just 10 years ago.”Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist and a former spokeswoman for Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, called the focus on identity politics a “crutch” and “extremely misguided.” “A person should not get extra points for their identity, but rather their policies and performance,” she said. “Republicans who used identity politics to promote any nominee\'s gender or sexual preference wasted valuable time that could have been devoted to touting their outstanding qualifications."The Trump White House, which exists in place of what would have been the administration of the first female U.S. president, made women’s empowerment an issue in its public-relations offensive in the days leading up to Haspel’s confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill.“There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel,” Sanders, the White House press secretary, tweeted on Saturday. “Any Democrat who claims to support women’s empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination is a total hypocrite.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

I’m delighted to hear it. Is that coincidental or is that purposeful?”The lone Republican woman on the committee, who ultimately decided to support Haspel’s nomination, was also unmoved by the gender-based argument. “That is not a relevant consideration for me,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.Still, President Trump himself went out of his way to underscore Haspel’;s gender by tweeting on Monday morning that “in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!”Trump’s most trusted and most watched allies in media followed suit, dutifully.“CIA Nominee Gina Haspel does not deserve to be a target in the left\'s ‘war on women,’” a Fox News op-ed by Brigitte Gabriel blared on Wednesday morning. “The spiteful attacks against Haspel reveal something particularly troubling about the way the left views women, particularly women who take a strong stance against terrorism.”The Republican National Committee, similarly, took to trolling on the issue, sending out multiple emails boosting Haspel and decrying the “DEMOCRATS’ WAR ON A HIGHLY-QUALIFIED WOMAN.”“She’s arguably the most qualified nominee for the position ever, but Democrats are waging a war against Gina Haspel, the 33-year CIA veteran who will be the first female to head the agency after she’s confirmed,” one email read.Another GOP rapid-response blast from Wednesday, the day of the hearing, \xa0offered the tongue-firmly-in-cheek subject hed:  “Dem mansplains [to] Haspel: ‘It’s not that complicated.’”An RNC official conceded that their email push was more about trolling liberals than a focus on feminism.“If the shoe were on the other foot, Democrats would be calling Republicans sexist for opposing the first female CIA director,” the committee’s spokesman Michael Ahrens told The Daily Beast. “Just giving them a taste of their own medicine.”Gregory T. Angelo, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, echoed Ahrens, saying conservatives were “fighting fire with fire.” Angelo was one of several prominent LGBT Republicans who decried the amount of time it took for U.S. Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell to be confirmed. When Grenell was sworn in earlier this month, he became the highest ranking openly gay official in the Trump administration. Angelo said that Republicans are becoming more comfortable highlighting diversity among already qualified people. “The difference is generally on the left identity politics are played in a manner to check off diversity quotas, on the right they aren’t,” he claimed.It’s unclear whether this line of defense is a temporary fix or will become part of a larger strategy as the administration shifts focus to the midterm elections. But it will probably come down to whether or not it works.“This is tragic, but there is now an assumption in politics that every attack is a good attack,” Luntz said.—With additional reporting by Andrew Desiderio'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Regardless of who wins in November, the 2018 House elections are already making history. The House primaries, which started on March 5 in Texas and will continue into September, rank as the most crowded ever. Already, more than 2,300 Republican and Democratic candidates are vying for office, nearly 50 percent more than the next highest year, the “Tea Party” election of 2010. In part, this candidate surge is a sign of the resiliency of our democracy, of the upwelling of participation our system needs. But there’s a catch. The vast majority of these primaries will take place in states with single-round simple plurality voting, in which the candidate with the most votes wins, regardless of whether that candidate has majority support. Simple plurality works well enough when few candidates are running, but in crowded races it can easily result in winners with low percentages of the vote, who may not be preferred by, or even be in step with, the majority. This year at least 146 U.S. House primaries will have five or more candidates, more than double the total for any recent election; 212 will have four or more. Already seven congressional primaries were won in Illinois without a majority, including one with just 29 percent.The country’s primary system already intensifies polarization because primary voters tend to be few in number (often less than 15 percent of registered voters) and more fiercely partisan than the voting population as a whole. This year’s primaries will intensify that dynamic, as the crowded fields cause vote splitting among mainstream candidates, clearing the way for candidates backed by only a fraction of the electorate to move forward to the general election.Low plurality winners can cost their party otherwise winnable seats, a dynamic that could hurt Democratic party prospects for winning the House. In strongly blue or red districts, these candidates will likely make it through to Congress, where there’s a good chance they’ll support more ideologically extreme positions.Ironically, the great surge of candidates running this year stems in part from individuals wanting to improve our democracy. But more participation is not the answer by itself to the problems we face. We also need to change our rules. The good news is that the 2018 primaries will also showcase a rule change that addresses the crowded election problem without the cost and decline in turnout associated with election runoffs. That change, called ranked choice voting (RCV), will be used in the primaries in Maine this summer.With RCV, voters mark a ballot designed to show first, second, and third choices (or more). The ballots are then counted in rounds (called “instant runoff”) in which the least-supported candidate is eliminated at each round. By taking into account multiple preferences, ranked choice ensures, in nearly all cases, that the winner is voted for by the majority and is the most preferred candidate. In Maine, decades of races won by candidates without a majority, most significantly at the Governor level, led voters to back a 2016 ballot initiative for the greater choice and majority rule provided by RCV. With seven Democrats and four Republicans running for governor, and four Democrats running in Maine’s second congressional district, RCV will have an immediate impact.The ranked choice mechanism shifts election results to the center of the electorate and to more representative nominees. Because candidates need to heed a larger electorate beyond their core supporters, RCV also makes campaigning less negative and promotes more collaborative approaches and candidates.RCV is used in a half-dozen countries around the world and in 12 cities around the country. Evaluations show that voters prefer it to simple plurality. The additional complexity of RCV ballots has not reduced turnout as some had feared. Instead, recent RCV elections in Minneapolis, Santa Fe and St. Paul resulted in the highest mayoral turnouts in more than a decade. RCV ballots can pose administrative challenges, but with new equipment and insight about good procedures, these challenges have been overcome. In Santa Fe’s five-candidate mayoral race, for example, 99.9 percent of voters cast a valid ballot, and the ranked choice results were announced on election night. Ranked choice voting also facilitates competition from independent and third party candidates because it significantly reduces the risk that voting for such candidates could help an ideological opponent.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Simple plurality is the norm in this country not because it’s in the Constitution (which leaves these issues to the states) or endorsed by the Founders; it’s simply all that the available technology could manage when we started voting back in the 1600s. Countries coming later to democracy have leap-frogged this system with newer innovations that use the moment of voting to learn more about what people want, exactly as ranked choice does. To date, learning more about what voters want has appealed more to good-governance groups, third parties, and independents than to our dominant political parties, who have perceived RCV as a threat. But that configuration of interests could be changing. The historic level of candidates this year reflects the takeover by the grassroots of traditional political organizing, a development that deeply undermines the parties’ role and even their reason for being. The solution is not reasserting central control of the candidate nomination process, it’s using the mechanism of ranked choice voting to translate this new, many-faceted participation into results that represent the majority.Kevin Johnson is executive director of Election Reformers Network, a nonprofit created by international democracy workers supporting reform in the U.S.Rob Richie is executive director of FairVote (www.fairvote.org), a nonprofit electoral reform organization."},
 {'title': 'Eric Schneiderman, a Political ‘Champion of Women,’ Accused of Assault By Four Women',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman now stands accused of physical abuse.Four women, two of whom spoke on the record, described the horrific allegations in detail to The New Yorker. Michelle Manning Barish, Tanya Selvaratnam, and two other women who asked to remain anonymous, said Schneiderman repeatedly beat them and choked them. Manning Barish and Selvaratnam, who both said the abuse amounted to “assault,” allege that Schneiderman threatened to kill them if they ended the relationship—charges that the attorney general denies, per his spokesman.In a statement, Schneiderman — a Democrat who\'s frequently clashed with President Donald Trump, and was recently charged by Gov. Andrew Cuomo with looking into how Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance may have mishandled allegations against fallen film mogul Harvey Weinstein — did not comment on the specific allegations but said his activities had always been consensual.“In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity,” he said. “I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in non-consensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.”Manning Barish said Schneiderman was a hypocrite for championing feminist issues and denouncing Weinstein in public while allegedly abusing women in private.“You cannot be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, ‘You’re a fucking whore,’” she told The New Yorker. “How can you put a perpetrator in charge of the country’s most important sexual-assault case?”Added Selvaratnam: “This is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly. But he abuses them privately. He needs to be called out.”Manning Barish recalled a night before bed during which Schneiderman allegedly slapped her “out of nowhere” and choked her. She says he slapped her so hard that her ear hurt for months. At one point, it began to bleed.“The choking was very hard. It was really bad. I kicked. In every fibre, I felt I was being beaten by a man,” she said.In a tweet sent shortly after the story’s publication, Barish said she felt compelled to speak out for the sake of all women. “After the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not,” she wrote. The story also details Schneiderman’s alleged encounter with a lawyer he met at a party in the Hamptons in the summer of 2016. The woman says Schneiderman, who had been drinking heavily, invited her to what she thought was going to be an after-party at another home, but it turned out to be the property where he was staying. There, the pair began kissing, but she recoiled when he became sexually aggressive, calling her “a dirty little slut” and “whore,” she said. The woman says she pulled away, at which point she says that he “slapped me across the face hard, twice.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“I was stunned,” she said. Schneiderman allegedly acted shocked when she wanted to leave. “You’d really be surprised,” she said he told her. “A lot of women like it. They don’t always think they like it, but then they do, and they ask for more.”Looking back, the woman said she wished she had reported the incident. “Our top law officer, this guy with a platform for women’s rights, just smacked away so much of what I thought he stood for,” she told The New Yorker. Tanya Selvaratnam, an author and actor, said she started dating Schneiderman in 2016, and what was at first a “fairy tale” relationship swiftly devolved into a “nightmare.” “The slaps started after we’d gotten to know each other,” she told The New Yorker. “It was at first as if he were testing me. Then it got stronger and harder.”The violence wasn’t consensual or “sexual playacting,” she said, but "abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.”She alleged that Schneiderman tried to bully her into having a threesome—and said he would slap her until she called him “Master.” The physical abuse only became more extreme over time, she said, and she soon feared for her safety. “We could rarely have sex without him beating me,” Selvaratnam claimed. She ended the relationship last fall. \xa0Just three weeks ago, Schneiderman blasted out a tweet praising “the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they endured at the hands of powerful men.” He credited reports in the The New York Times and The New Yorker with the “critical national reckoning underway.” In a statement Monday night, Gov. Cuomo, himself a former state Attorney General, said that "No one is above the law, including New York\'s top legal officer." He continued: "My personal opinion is that, given the damning pattern of facts and collaboration laid out in the article, I do not believe it is possible for Eric Schneiderman to continue to serve as Attorney General, and for the good of the office, he should resign."'},
 {'title': 'Mick Mulvaney Met With Lobbyist Donors While at Trump White House',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump’s top budget and financial consumer watchdog, had a hierarchy of access in his former congressional office: first were constituents, then lobbyists who’d donated to his campaign, and then, at the bottom, lobbyists who hadn’t.Mulvaney no longer has constituents. But according to his internal schedule, he’s continued taking meetings with lobbyists and companies who financed his past political campaigns. At least eight registered lobbyists and six other executives who donated to Mulvaney’s congressional campaigns—or whose companies’ political action committees did the same—got an audience with the South Carolina Republican when he landed atop the Office of Management and Budget. That’s according to a Daily Beast analysis of campaign finance records, lobbying disclosure forms, and OMB visitor logs dating from January 2017 through September 2017. The findings illustrate how the political structure Mulvaney outlined in his speech this week before a group of banking executives was not simply a system for his congressional office but a maxim for the ways he—like many others in the nation’s capital—conduct political and policy work.“We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress,” Mulvaney said, according to a New York Times report this week. At the top of the hierarchy were his constituents, he explained, adding, “If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.”The lobbyists who gave to Mulvaney, and who subsequently scored meetings with him at OMB, represented a wide array of companies, many with interests before federal agencies over whose structure and finances the White House budget office holds considerable sway.Meetings with lobbyist donors began almost immediately after Mulvaney assumed his post at OMB on February 16, 2017. Eight days later, he sat down with the CEO of Delta Airlines and two of its senior government relations executives. One of them, Andrea Newman, then the company’s top lobbyist, personally donated $1,000 to Mulvaney’s campaign in 2014. Delta’s PAC gave the congressman’s re-election efforts $5,000 since then.That type of access continued through at least early September, the extent of publicly available records on Mulvaney’s internal schedule. On September 5, he had a phone call with David Metzner, a lobbyist with the American Continental Group. Metzner donated $2,000 to Mulvaney’s campaign in 2016.Some of Mulvaney’s lobbyist powwows appear to have addressed some very specific policy goals. In July 2017, he took a meeting with lobbyist and campaign contributor Gregory Smith of the firm Hobbs Straus Dean & Walker. Among Smith’s clients is the Catawba Indian Nation, which was seeking federal government approval for a new casino in North Carolina. Joining Smith and Mulvaney at the meeting was Wallace Cheves, the owner of Skyboat Gaming, which is working with the Catawba Nation to develop the casino.Marc Cadin, the chief operating officer of—and registered lobbyist for—the Association for Advanced Life Underwriting (AALU), met with Mulvaney on April 27 and July 17 of 2017. At the latter meeting, he was joined by AALU president Rich DeVita, who donated more than $6,000 to Mulvaney’s campaigns from 2011 through 2016. During the same window, AALU’s PAC gave Mulvaney more than $10,000.Mulvaney’s schedule, details of which were obtained by ProPublica, paint a portrait of a top government official being pulled in a myriad directions as the Trump administration tried to find its early footing. His days were filled with a mix of press briefings and interviews, conversations with lawmakers, and discussions with other members of the administration as it charted out major tax, budget, and health care initiatives. But despite these demands, Mulvaney also managed to make time for influential donors—and in particular lobbyists and business leaders from his home state of South Carolina.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Steven Beckham, a registered lobbyist who gave $1,500 to Mulvaney over the course of three elections, met with the OMB Director on March 30, 2017. Along with Beckham was Harris Pastides, the President of the University of South Carolina, an institution for which Beckham lobbied federally. Another federal lobbyist, David Wilkins, got a meeting in early April 2017. Watkins represents a host of energy, financial services, and health care companies for the firm Nelson Mulllins Riley & Scarborough. He is also based in Greenville, S.C. and gave Mulvaney’s campaign more than $5,000 from 2010 through 2016. Mulvaney carved out time for two meetings and a phone call with Scott Serota, the president and CEO of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Two of that company’s lobbyists have donated to Mulvaney’s campaign, and he’s received huge checks from the PAC run by its South Carolina arm.Dan Adams, the CEO of the Capital Corporation, a middle market investment firm based in Greenville, South Carolina, met with Mulvaney on June 28, 2017. Prior to then, he donated $12,400 to Mulvaney’s various congressional runs, Adams donated $12,400. Lex Kerssemakers, the CEO of Volvo, met with Mulvaney on April 26, 2017. No one from Volvo gave to the congressman. But the company does have a new plant in South Carolina, an expansion of which Kerssemakers has overseen. Kerssemakers was also raising major concerns about a proposed border adjustment tax at the time that he scored his sit down. The Trump administration signalled it would drop the proposal the day before the meeting and it formally did a few months later. Meetings like this raised flags for government ethicists who say that Mulvaney not only copted to having a pay-to-play scheme while in Congress but seems to have engaged in one while working for the president. “It sounds like Mulvaney is importing his pay to play operation from Congress into the administration,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group. “But the problem of public officials serving the wealthy and well-connected isn’t limited to Mick Mulvaney,” Fischer added in an email. “It’s systemic, and demands systemic solutions. Trump knows this, and ran against it—as a candidate, he criticized a system where ‘when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.’ Mulvaney’s words, and apparently his actions, are just unvarnished examples of how the entire political system is tilted in favor of deep-pocketed special interests.”The Office of Management and Budget did not return a request for comment. Nor did any of those who met with him who were mentioned in this piece. \xa0Mulvaney’s comments about lobbyist access have also drawn the scrutiny of lawmakers concerned about industry influence. In a letter on Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren asked Mulvaney if his lobbyist access hierarchy has made its way to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Mulvaney has led on an interim basis since last year.But not every one of Mulvaney’s meetings fit cleaning into the hierarchical structure which he outlined. For instance, Mulvaney did meet with at least one lobbyist who did not donate to a congressional campaign. That influence-peddler was DeWitt Zemp, who met with the OMB chair on July 26. Zemp isn’t a federally-registered lobbyist. He is a state-based lobbyist for the political consulting firm Southern Strategy Group based in Columbia, South Carolina.And, on occasion, he met with a prominent GOP moneyman who neither lobbied nor gave to him nor had South Carolina roots. One such meeting took place on April 11, 2017, when Mulvaney met with Steve Wynn, the disgraced casino magnate who, at the time, was still the Republican National Committee finance chair. "},
 {'title': 'Accused Russian Intel Asset Teamed Up With GOP Operative',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As 2016 campaign season neared, a Russian national who special counsel Robert Mueller now believes was working with the country’s intelligence services founded a consulting firm in Washington, D.C. Begemot Ventures International was incorporated in February 2015, occupying an office on Constitution Avenue. Like other firms in the nation’s capital it offered services catering to the politically inclined. But unlike those other shops, Begemot had executives tied not just to an alleged Russian influence campaign, but also a controversial data firm that would later help elect President Donald Trump.The space that the firm continues to occupy also houses the offices of Sam Patten, a Republican lobbyist and foreign policy consultant who had previously worked to hone the firm Cambridge Analytica’s microtargeting operation during the 2014 midterm election cycle. They don’t just share a location either. Patten is listed as one of two Begemot executives in D.C. incorporation records. The other is Konstantin Kilimnik, who is currently front-and-center in the federal investigation into Russian government meddling in the 2016 presidential election. A recent court filing by Mueller alleged that “Person A”—believed to be Kilimnik—“has ties to Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.” Kilimnik has a years-long professional relationship with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whom Mueller has accused of illegally advancing the interests of foreign clients in the U.S. Kilimnik was a frequent intermediary between Manafort and Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, to whom Manafort offered private briefings on the 2016 presidential race. Kilimnik has long been suspected of having worked with or for Russian intelligence services in the past. But Mueller’s allegations are so explosive because they allege such ties continued through the presidential election—ties that would, by virtue of Kilimnik’s association with Manafort, represent the Trump campaign’s closest known link to Kremlin operatives.But those close to Kilimnik say the allegations are at a minimum overblown, and at most an outright fabrication. Patten too rejected allegations of Kilimnik’s Russian intelligence ties in an interview this week.Patten acknowledged his collaboration with Kilimnik on Begemot, which he said operates entirely abroad despite its D.C. address. Patten also confirmed his work with Cambridge Analytica, saying he assisted the firm’s U.S. operations in 2014, and also worked with the company on “several overseas campaigns.” He declined to go into further detail, citing a nondisclosure agreement, but stressed that his work for Begemot and Cambridge Analytica were entirely separate. Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for additional information. There is little public information about Begemot, whose name literally translates (from Russian) to hippopotamus but also may be a reference to a character in the Russian novel The Master and Margarita. Its emergence on the political scene—and the principles involved in its creation—underscore the smallness of the universe of Republican operatives and foreign policy hands who have done business with those at the center of the Russia investigation.Begemot’s website says it “helps its clients win elections, strengthen political parties, build the right arguments before domestic and international audiences, and achieve better results.” But it doesn’t disclose any of those clients, or even the countries in which they operate. Patten declined to go into any detail about its work.Patten’s relationship with Kilimnik goes back nearly two decades, when they worked together at the International Republican Institute, a GOP-aligned foreign policy group. In 2007 and 2008, Patten was an undersecretary of state for Democracy and Global Affairs in the Bush administration. He has also lobbied for political parties in Iraq and Georgia, and currently represents a group called the Committee to Destroy ISIS, a campaign funded in part, records show, by a Jordanian construction company.“I operate in a small niche,” Patten said of his work.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Patten’s association with Cambridge Analytica began in 2014. His personal website says he worked with the firm “to introduce new technologies and methodologies to U.S. campaigns during the 2014 congressional cycle.” The “beta run” of Cambridge Analytica’s microtargeting efforts, the website says, was “adopted by at least one major U.S. presidential candidate.” At the time the website was written, Patten said, Cambridge Analytica was working on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), though Patten never worked on behalf of the Cruz campaign. Cambridge Analytica would later work to elect Trump. The data firm is at the center of controversy over the use of social media data in political micro-targeting efforts. A Cambridge Analytica whistleblower claims the company pilfered data from Facebook for use on behalf of its political clients. The company denies any wrongdoing. And Trump campaign officials have tried to downplay the efficacy of the firms work, even though the campaign spent nearly $6 million for its services. Mueller’s team is examining the role that Cambridge Analytica played in Trump’s election victory, but there is no indication that Patten’s work for the firm is problematic or of any interest to the special counsel’s investigation. Patten himself played down the connection, saying his work for the firm was “wholly unconnected” to Begemot and Kilimnik.Begemot, Patten said, “is a privately-held, small consulting company that has provided public relations and political strategy advice for clients outside the United States, and [is] not related to the ongoing circus here.” Patten expressed skepticism about Mueller’s recent allegations about his colleague. “A lot of people in our country wish Mueller well. If this is his ace in the hole, I am profoundly depressed,” he said. “I have no reason to suspect him of being a Russian agent,” Patten added. “For people to continuously repeat the ‘in contact with/working with Russian intel’ epithet about anyone who lives or works in a country ruled by an ex KGB officer is rather absurd.” Such a description, he said, could include “anyone who rides the Moscow metro.”"},
 {'title': 'Facebook Finally Reveals Who’s Targeting You With Those Pesky Political Ads',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Tired of being targeted by Facebook ads showing Jesus and Satan in an arm wrestling match where the future of the Republic depends on whose limb gives out first? Well, you’re in luck. You still may see those ads. But at least now you will know who’s paying for them. That’s because on Thursday tech giant Facebook rolled out a new political ad disclosure database that will allow users to search for political and issue ads run on the platform, view all ads being run by verified political and policy groups, see the money those groups are spending on Facebook ads, and pinpoint the demographics they are targeting with those ads.The database is Facebook’s latest response to criticism over the opacity of malicious advertising on its platform during the 2016 campaign and, perhaps, its most aggressive. The company also told reporters on Thursday that it plans to hire between 3,000 and 4,000 employees to monitor ads for political content. Additionally, those employees will be tasked with reviewing ads reported by users using a new feature allowing anyone on Facebook to flag political ads that haven’t been properly disclosed. “We believe in giving legitimate campaigns a voice—while also helping to make sure that people can find out who is trying to influence their vote and why,” said Katie Harbath, Facebook’s Global Politics and Government Outreach Director, in a statement on the rollout. “We think this is a significant step toward that end.”The new disclosure database is a significant step towards ad transparency for a major hub of political influence. It comes as Congress considers legislation that would boost disclosure requirements for online political advertising by classifying them in the same category as ads on TV, radio, or other media.The announcement on Thursday is in response to months of scrutiny of the company’s role in efforts by malicious actors during the 2016 campaign, in particular agents affiliated with the Russian government, to sow discord in the American electorate and tip the scales of the election in favor of President Donald Trump. Those efforts included the infamous ad of Jesus and Satan arm-wrestling for the outcome of the 2016 election, which implored users to “press ‘like’ to help Jesus win!” Others were more pernicious, attempting to stoke racial tensions and fuel suspicion of immigrants and refugees.In a series of congressional hearings last month, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by lawmakers of both parties over the company’s political ad disclosure policies and efforts to combat surreptitious influence operations.The new ad disclosure platform will make available information on ads beyond those that explicitly call for the election or defeat of a political candidate. It will also include “issue ads” that take sides on one of 20 high-profile political matters, including health care, civil rights, taxes, and criminal justice. Facebook said on a conference call with reporters on Thursday that it expects to expand the range of issues covered in consultation with the polling and survey firm YouGov.Good government groups greeted Facebook’s announcement on Thursday with cautious optimism.“My initial reaction is that this is a more in-depth explanation of how Facebook is going to define a ‘political ad subject to these new measures than I’ve previously seen,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, which has worked to step up online advertising disclosure requirements.Facebook appears to be leading its competitors in the political disclosure arena. In October, Twitter pledged a new “ad transparency center” in the “coming weeks,” but has yet to unveil any comprehensive database of political or issue advertising on its platform.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But though Facebook is taking such steps, it’s also raising some additional questions about how it manages its political advertising. “There are still outstanding questions about the reach of some of these measures,” Fischer said. He pointed to recent reporting on Facebook verification measures that would have the effect of barring undocumented immigrants from buying ads on the platform to advocate various immigration policy measures.“We can anticipate some gripes from individuals who will have to go through the verification process for ads that may not be overtly political, and we can also anticipate that Facebook’s reviewers will miss some political ads,” Fischer said. “It seems that Facebook recognizes that this is going to be a process that involves continual learning, and hopefully it isn’t something they’ll abandon once public attention turns elsewhere.”"},
 {'title': 'Two Members of Congress Were Rumored to Be Having an Affair. He May Be the Next Speaker. She’s Out of a Job.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It’s a testament to male dominance in Congress that Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is the leading candidate to lead House Republicans for the second time in three years, even after his first effort imploded. And that former Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, rumored to be having an affair with McCarthy that was evidently a big reason for that implosion, is gone from Washington with hardly a trace.Both were married, both brushed off the accusation, but that didn’t stop the rumor being spread by a major Republican donor, written about in influential blogs like RedState.com, and whispered about in the cloakroom. The difference in how the two people \xa0— who did not return calls for this article — caught up in the same rumor fared afterward is a parable of how Congress works, and doesn’t, in the #MeToo era.Ellmers was once a rising star with a career as an ICU nurse married to a surgeon in Dunn, North Carolina. She \xa0didn’t like what she saw of Obamacare and decided to  run for Congress. A happy conservative, telegenic, quick on her feet, a people person, she upset a seven-term incumbent in 2010. She won reelection easily until 2016, when \xa0suddenly she wasn’t conservative enough any longer. She  was primaried by several candidates in a redrawn district. One opponent ran an ad alluding to the alleged affair that stated, “I'm not running against Renee because she's been unfaithful to her husband; I'm running against Renee because she's been unfaithful to her constituents.” Ellmers isn’t running for anything these days, much less for Speaker. \xa0She lost the 2016 Second District primary by 30 points to George Holding, the representative from the 13th \xa0favored by good ole boys in Washington although he \xa0didn’t even live in the district. Now, Ellmers doesn’t \xa0work in the state she represented. She oversees Region 4 \xa0\xa0of the Department of Health and Human Services in Atlanta, Georgia, worthy work for a talented public servant but far from the center of politics As for McCarthy, with \xa0Paul Ryan stepping out of the picture, he is a good bet to succeed him in January. It’s good to be male.In 2015, the allegation of an affair was one of those Washington secrets that gets talked about but no one reports on until North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones wrote a letter to the leadership days before the vote asking that any candidate with “misdeeds he has committed since joining Congress that will embarrass himself” withdraw. \xa0With that sentence, the sub rosa story went rosa. The Washington Examiner published the headline “Specter of sex scandal injected into GOP leadership race.” Ellmers was quoted in The Hill saying, ““I can’t vote for someone [McCarthy] who doesn’t ask for my vote.  I’m apparently not high on his priority list,”  making the race look like a student council election where the star quarterback and the head cheerleader turn on each other. Minutes before the vote, McCarthy shocked the caucus and dropped out, saying that the party needed a fresher face than his.Since then, some things have changed. Post-Trump, the right wing Freedom Caucus makes no pretense it cares about sexual indiscretions. Stormy who? They might vote against McCarthy, but not over family values. On the other hand, awareness that sex at work often ends badly —whether consensual or not, with or without sexual harassment — is rising.But on Capitol Hill, not so much. \xa0Even Hollywood is more evolved than Congress, which \xa0writes its own rules. Power is absolute and women, willing and unwilling, get caught up in it. If you don’t believe that a former insurance salesman presiding over a mahogany-paneled office with a wall of grip and grin photos reflecting the \xa0twinkling lights of the Capitol dome believes the job comes with benefits, you’re wrong. Washington is the kind of place where if Mitch McConnell and George Clooney walk into a fundraiser, it will be a close call who attracts more attention.  Not only do members have affairs with impunity, but if one goes wrong or there’s harassment involved \xa0the rules are heavily tilted  to exonerate the member, silence the victim, and fund the settlement with taxpayer dollars. Have an affair as a staffer and you best become Newt’s next wife, or find yourself jobless when it ends. \xa0Almost everything happens in secret. Rep. Blake Farenthold, for instance, hung on for three years after a payment in 2015 of $84,000 in hush money to a former staffer he had “wet dreams” and “sexual fantasies” about—all in jest, he explained when the payoff \xa0came out under the glare of #MeToo. He left this month but he’s yet to pay back a dime of the $84,000.An alleged consensual affair shouldn’t necessarily decide a leadership race. It hurts two families, not the body politic. But it’s very troubling to look at the diverging political fates of the two people supposedly involved. Ellmers paid a much heavier price than McCarthy, losing her seat in the House and leaving Washington. Just two nights ago, there was McCarthy, the putative next Speaker of the House, pictured everywhere arriving in his tux at the state dinner for President Emmanuel Macron, one of only three members invited.The talented Ellmers is more fortunate than many women on Capitol Hill.

  'body': "As the opioid epidemic ravages the country, lawmakers pushing for reforms to how the drugs are prescribed have encountered a series of roadblocks from a surprising source: the lobby for physicians. Advocates for further restrictions and physician education on the highly addictive drugs say the American Medical Association has actively lobbied against the inclusion of several recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and that many members of Congress are unwilling to go up against the powerful lobby. Several of the CDC guidelines were included in a bill called Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act 2.0, introduced by Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) in February, an update to the Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act that was signed into law in 2016. Portman’s office confirmed that lobbyists from the group have told the Ohio senator’s staff they would not support provisions in the CARA 2.0 about the three-day rule or any mandatory physician education included in the bill.The AMA opposition to proposals like limiting prescriptions of the highly addictive drugs to three-day supplies, mandating that physicians have courses about drugs and addiction, or even requiring physicians to check databases before prescribing certain drugs has confused and infuriated advocates.During a meeting of advocates to curb opioid abuse last week, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) summed up the lack of progress on certain proposals, telling the group that some of his colleagues were “too scared to take on the AMA.” The AMA was the seventh highest lobbying spender in 2017, with $21.5 million spent. Nearly $6.8 million has been spent in 2018 so far, according to OpenSecrets.com. It gave nearly $2 million to members of Congress in 2016 and has given $519,500 so far this election cycle. It’s a message that’s been passed on to advocates for change from other offices as well. Gary Mendell, CEO of Shatterproof—a nonprofit aimed at “ending the devastation addiction causes families”—said he has been told by congressional staff that “the AMA will resist anything that regulates health care” on a number of issues. Mendell added that the AMA had also pushed against other opioid-safety related measures like federal grant money that required states to require their prescribers to check the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs before they prescribed certain controlled substance medications and shared that information with other states. PDMPs help doctors analyze a patient’s prescription drug history prior to distributing additional medication and are mandatory in more than half of states, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, but not regulated on the federal level. “The AMA doesn’t dispute that doctors should check the Prescription Drug Monitor Program, but they resist a law that requires them to do that.”— Gary Mendell, Shatterproof“The AMA doesn’t dispute that doctors should check the Prescription Drug Monitor Program, but they resist a law that requires them to do that,” Mendell said. “I’m not about regulating health care. I don’t care if it’s regulated or not. I just care that they are safely taken care of… if doctors were doing it on their own, then we wouldn’t be having this conversation.“It’s tragic,” Mendell, who founded Shatterproof after his son Brian died in 2011 after nearly a decade-long battle with addiction, said of the resistance to implementing potentially life-saving recommendations. “I’ll never see my son again. Other families shouldn’t have to go through this.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In March 2016, the CDC issued a series of recommendations for how opioids are prescribed, including that physicians give the lowest possible dose once they are prescribed and limit the prescription to three days or less for acute pain (PDF). “More than seven days will rarely be needed,” the CDC noted. The AMA contends that the group is not at odds with the CDC, pointing to the fact that it issued only recommendations and that “efforts to codify a strict limit on prescribing opioids are inconsistent with both the language and spirit of the guidelines.” “A strict three-day limit ignores the admonition from the CDC guideline that ‘Clinical decision making should be based on a relationship between the clinician and patient, and an understanding of the patient’s clinical situation, functioning, and life context,’ misstates the actual recommendation of the CDC, and applies limits to clinical situations to which they were not intended to be applied,” the AMA said in a statement. “Limits and one-size-fits-all approaches will not end this epidemic,” the AMA said. “The AMA has urged Congress, statehouses, and payers to cover evidence-based treatment that works. Most patients with opioid use disorder have trouble accessing care as payers and others put up obstacles.”Not all recent opioid-related legislation has been stalled, of course. Another bill, Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, was recently voted out of committee. While it reauthorizes grant money to the states for three years and directs money to states where the need is most dire, it does includes funding for a “study” on prescription limitations. Still, a spokesman for Portman said the Ohio senator was unfazed by the powerful opposition. “People are dying around the country every single day because patients are being prescribed too many opioid pills at one time,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Portman. “A three-day limit is common sense, based on CDC guidelines, and Senator Portman is going to stand up and fight for what is right.”"},
 {'title': 'Primary Preview: What to Watch for in Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and Idaho',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The heated primary season continues on Tuesday as voters in Idaho, Nebraska, Oregon, and Pennsylvania head to the polls. Of those four states, Pennsylvania is playing host to the broadest field of candidates and will be hugely determinative in whether Democrats can retake a majority in the House of Representatives in November. That is, in part, because of a newly redrawn map by the state’s Supreme Court which replaces a previous one thrown out on the grounds that it was a partisan gerrymander. Pennsylvania has long been represented by 13 Republican House members and 5 Democratic ones, which belied its swing state status and the close electoral win of Donald Trump in 2016. Now, Democrats have an opportunity to win a potential quarter of the necessary 23 net House seats they need to win the majority in Pennsylvania alone. The two of the easiest pickup opportunities for the party are in previously Republican-held seats that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. That includes the new 5th Congressional District represented by Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA), who resigned at the end of April following revelations that he had used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim. Previously, the district was carved out in a circuitous pattern to the west of Philadelphia and was a district that Clinton won by two points. Under the new district parameters, she would have won it by 28. There are 10 Democrats running for the seat with no obvious frontrunner. But whether former federal prosecutor Ashley Lunkenheimer, state Rep. Greg Vitali, or any of the others jockeying for the seat win the primary Tuesday, they will be heavily favored to take the seat in November. In Pennsylvania’s new 7th Congressional District, a similar battle is being waged albeit with fewer Democrats. The seat, previously occupied by Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) who announced his retirement, went from a place\xa0Trump won by eight points to one Clinton would have won by a point. There are three likely Democratic frontrunners, all of whom represent particular factions of the Democratic Party. John Morganelli, a district attorney, is a centrist Democrat who has expressed some Trump-inclined immigration views and recently scrubbed his Twitter page of supportive tweets for the president. Attorney Susan Wild has the backing of Emily’s List and African-American pastor Greg Edwards has the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and a host of progressive organizations. There are other districts where sitting Republicans are facing major challenges as well, including Pennsylvania’s new 1st District which now leans more Democratic. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) currently represents the districts and there are three Democrats running in Tuesday’s primary to challenge him. In Pennsylvania’s new 17th Congressional District, two sitting members of Congress will face off against each other in November’s general election. After a surprise win in the old 18th District, vacated by Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA), Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA) will now challenge Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-PA) in the 17th which became considerably more Democratic-leaning in the new map. Lamb’s current district, the 18th, actually became more Trump-friendly in the new map and state Rep. Rick Saccone, who lost to Lamb earlier this year, is running there again but faces a credible primary challenge from state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler. Three other states are also hosting contests on Tuesday. Voters in Idaho will choose between three Republican gubernatorial candidates, including Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) to replace retiring Republican Gov. Butch Otter. Finally, in Nebraska, Democrats are hoping they can peel off another win in November in the state’s 2nd Congressional District where Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) narrowly won in 2016 against former Rep. Brad Ashford (D-NE) who won the seat in 2014. Former President Obama won the district in 2008 and Trump only won it by two points in 2016. Ashford is running again in Tuesday’s primary and faces Kara Eastman, a progressive challenger who supports Medicare-for-All. '},
 {'title': 'Trump Org ‘Gifts’ Treasury $150K in Foreign Government ‘Emoluments’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump’s company paid more than $150,000 to the Treasury Department in February to head off allegations that it is improperly accepting money from foreign governments.The Trump Organization paid Treasury $151,470, which it says is the sum of its profits derived from foreign government payments to Trump hotels and resorts in 2017. That total was reported last month, but records obtained by The Daily Beast through a Freedom of Information Act request confirm Treasury’s receipt of the funds. “The Trump Organization is pleased to make this voluntary donation to the U.S. government and requests that it be deposited into the ‘Gifts to the United States’ account for the unconditioned and general use of the federal government,” wrote Sherri Dillon, an attorney for the company, in a letter dated February 22.But groups that have scrutinized President Trump’s conflicts of interest in office were not satisfied by the payment, saying there is no mechanism for determining its accuracy.“There’s no transparency as to how they arrived at the number, how profits were calculated, or where the profits came from,” said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for the left-leaning watchdog group Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The group is one of a number of plaintiffs in ongoing lawsuits alleging that the payments violate a provision of the U.S. Constitution that bars federal officials from receiving payments—or “emoluments”—from foreign governments.“Even if they were giving the full amount, which we\'re pretty sure they are not, it would not solve President Trump\'s foreign emoluments issue, as the Constitution bans the mere acceptance of them," Libowitz said in an email.Public records indicate that revenue from foreign government tenants and customer is far higher than the profit the company says it earned from those payments. Two foreign government-owned companies alone currently pay an estimated $1,990,000 in annual rent to two Trump properties, according to a recent Forbes report.Those rent payments are not included in the sum of foreign government payments compiled by the Trump Organization for the purposes of tallying “donation of profits from foreign government patronage,” according to documents provided to congressional investigators. The company is only including profits from stays at its hotels in that total, not payments for meals or commercial office space.But those sums are considerable in their own right. Trump’s hotel in Washington DC also received $270,000 from the government of Saudi Arabia in late 2016 and early 2017, according to records on file with the Department of Justice.In addition to CREW’s lawsuit, Trump is facing litigation from the governments of Maryland and Washington DC, which are also challenging the constitutionality of Trump’s continued interests in businesses that receive payments from foreign governments.Upon taking office, Trump put his business assets into a trust that is managed by his two adult sons. But his refusal to divest those assets completely has fueled allegations of a conflict of interest between his official duties as president and his company’s financial interests.'},
 {'title': 'Kamala Harris Now Says She Won’t Accept Corporate PAC Money',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) joined a cadre of her progressive Democratic colleagues Monday by saying that she will not accept corporate PAC money. She made the comments during an interview with the New York radio show The Breakfast Club, marking a shift in her public comments on the issue as of late. “I did a town hall a couple weeks ago in California and I was asked that question,” Harris told host Charlamagne Tha God. “And I wasn’t expecting the question and I thought about it afterwards. And I’m gonna tell you Charlamagne. I actually, I think that money has had such an outside influence on politics, and especially with the Supreme Court—it determining Citizens United, which basically means that big corporations can spend unlimited amounts of money influencing a campaign, right? We’re all supposed to have an equal vote. But money has now really tipped the balance between an individual having equal power in an election to a corporation. So I’ve actually made a decision since I had that conversation that I’m not gonna accept corporate PAC checks.”Harris, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president in 2020, joins Senators Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bernie Sanders in this pledge. At a town hall in California this month, Harris was asked by an audience member if she would turn down money offered to her from a corporation or corporate lobbyist.Harris said “Well, it depends. It depends”—prompting the audience member to quickly respond “Wrong answer.”“Well, that’s not the answer you want to hear,” Harris continued. “It doesn’t make it wrong.”“I appreciate the reason that you’re asking it. I do appreciate that,” Harris told the audience member. “And that’s why we have rules that require that any donation that anyone receives needs to be disclosed. So that you can do an assessment, and the voters can do an assessment, and look at where the contributions come from and make your decisions about whether those contributions have influenced the way that people act and the way that people vote.”'},
 {'title': 'Senator Suggests Haspel Aided Wrongful CIA Kidnapping, Votes for Her',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A crucial Democratic senator suggested that Donald Trump’s pick to run the CIA bears some responsibility for the rendition and torture of an innocent man. But soon after Gina Haspel provided a vague answer, the senator nevertheless announced his support for her controversial nomination.Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee, wanted to know if Haspel bears “responsibility” for kidnapping Khaled el-Masri in Macedonia in 2004—and, possibly, responsibility for other wrongful renditions cases. Taken to a black site in Afghanistan, el-Masri was tortured by the CIA for months before discovering he was a case of mistaken identity, and was never a terrorist. In the final round of questions for Haspel ahead of Wednesday morning’s vote in the Senate committee, Warner referred to Haspel’s earlier recognition in written questions that el-Masri “did not meet the standard for rendition,” though she couched that in terms of an inspector general’s finding and did not concede el-Masri’s innocence.Quoting the inspector general’s assessment of “inaccurate legal text” that the CIA used to justify el-Masri’s rendition, and potentially those of other people, Warner asked Haspel: “Do you believe you have responsibility for any of these flawed decisions? What steps did you take to ensure that another innocent individual would not be wrongfully rendered?”“I take full responsibility for all my actions,” Haspel replied, in answers released Tuesday, though Haspel did not say explicitly that she considers herself partially culpable for el-Masri or other mistaken renditions cases. “Throughout my career, I have sought to ensure that CIA operations have been conducted professionally and in accordance with appropriate legal guidance. Even so, I have learned hard lessons through my experience in the Counterterrorism Center. One of those lessons is a need to foster a culture of questioning in the workforce in which junior officers feel comfortable challenging the process to make sure CIA’s activities adhere to the highest standards.”Asked whether Haspel was admitting responsibility for el-Masri’s rendition, a CIA spokesman, Ryan Trapani, said he had “nothing to add to the extensive on-the-record statements and responses Acting Director Haspel has provided.” But Haspel hasn’t been linked to the el-Masri debacle before. Nor has she substantially been tied to the CIA’s torture-era renditions, the aspect of the program that not even the Senate intelligence committee’s 2014 torture program shed light upon, despite being believed to be the largest component of what the agency calls “Renditions, Detentions, and Interrogations.” The exception has come in the form of a letter John McCain, a torture survivor who opposes Haspel, wrote in March asking Haspel if she believed it was “justified” to kidnap and turn over to Moammar Gadhafi a Libyan dissident couple. McCain stopped short of accusing Haspel of involvement in the rendition. The woman in question, Fatima Boudchar, who was pregnant during her CIA kidnapping, recently wrote a New York Times op-ed with her own “questions” for Haspel, but conceded: “I don’t know what Ms. Haspel’s part in what happened to me was or what she thinks about it.”El-Masri’s rendition occurred in January 2004. Boudchar’s occurred in March 2004. During that time, Haspel was part of the Counterterrorism Center, which ran the rendition, detention and interrogation program, but she has not publicly detailed her role in it.Captured in Macedonia, el-Masri told his CIA jailers that he was sure they had the wrong man. Internal CIA doubts about him ultimately led to his unceremonious release in May 2004—after which, according to a European court, he was sodomized, drugged, and shackled naked to a ceiling. The agency dumped el-Masri, a German citizen on a Macedonian road with his belongings and about $17,000. It has never apologized to him, even though a 2007 CIA inspector general’s report says his capture and torture “was not supported by available intelligence,” according to the Senate torture report. The episode left el-Masri suffering persistent mental and emotional scars.Warner, however, pledged his support to Haspel on Tuesday afternoon, following a letter from Haspel that went somewhat further than she did in her hearing of admitting that the torture program was wrong. “While I won't condemn those that made these hard calls, and I have noted the valuable intelligence collected, the program ultimately did damage to our officers and our standing in the world,” Haspel said—framing the wrongness of the program in terms of its ultimate damage to the CIA and America, not in terms of the at least 119 people the CIA brutalized. “I’m going to support Gina Haspel’s nomination to be Director of the CIA. I also respect my colleagues who have made a different decision,” Warner said in a Tuesday statement.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“If she is confirmed, the Senate Intelligence Committee will continue to conduct thorough and vigorous oversight over the nation’s intelligence agencies.”A Warner spokesperson, Rachel Cohen, noted that the question and Haspel’s answer are unclassified, but said that she understood Haspel to be providing “a general statement,” rather than acknowledging culpability in el-Masri’s case. “Without discussing anyone’s specific involvement in the el-Masri issue, the question is not only who’s responsible, but what steps the agency (or in this case Haspel) takes to learn from mistakes. I took her answer to be a general statement that while at CTC, she observed mistakes that convinced her that you have to empower people in the bureaucracy to question the process and ask questions to stop things from going wrong. That is a good thing,” Cohen told The Daily Beast.Fielding her latest round of questions from the Senate panel, Haspel shed no additional public light on her involvement in torture, saying her “classified” activities would need to remain the subject of closed-door scrutiny—including her role in the 2002 torture of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, which she oversaw as chief of base for the Thailand black site where it occurred. But Haspel did clarify her bizarre claim at last week’s hearing that she wasn’t “read into” the torture program for a year into its operation. Haspel backdated the program to begin on September 17, 2001, pursuant to a George W. Bush executive order, even though the CIA didn’t capture its first detainee, Abu Zubaydah, until March 2002 and didn’t receive legal cover from the Justice Department to torture him until August 2002. Haspel, in her final answers before the vote, clarified that she was “read into” the torture program in October 2002—the month she arrived at the Thailand black site where al-Nashiri would arrive weeks later. With Warner’s support, the likelihood of Haspel receiving Senate confirmation has gone up substantially—and may guarantee that a CIA official involved in its torture program will become its next director. \xa0"},
 {'title': '‘Astonishing’ Facebook Intervention Could Have Compromised Cambridge Analytica Evidence, Says U.K.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Facebook has been plunged into crisis over the allegations that Cambridge Analytica misused data from more than 50 million people to help elect Donald Trump. Nearly $40 billion was wiped off Facebook’s market value Monday, an emergency meeting is due to be held Tuesday morning, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been criticized for remaining silent during what some analysts are describing as a threat to the company’s existence.Zuckerberg has been summoned to the British parliament to give evidence about the how it handles people\'s personal data. The head of a British inquiry into \'fake news,\' Damian Collins, has accused Facebook of previously \'misleading\' a parliament committee, adding: "It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process."As anger grew toward Cambridge Analytica on Monday after Britain’s Channel 4 broadcast a report showing company executives boasting about their extreme propaganda strategies, including filming opponents in compromising situations with Ukrainian sex workers, authorities in the U.K. and the U.S. also questioned whether Facebook mishandled the alleged breach and it’s now facing damaging investigations that will further tarnish its brand.Britain’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, confirmed she was applying to the courts for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica’s London offices and said Tuesday morning that she has been left frustrated by the company’s reluctance to cooperate with her investigation.Fears have also been raised that the investigation may have been compromised by the presence of cybersecurity consultants from Stroz Friedberg—the company hired by Facebook to audit Cambridge Analytica on its behalf—who were in the London offices on Monday evening, until they were asked to leave by the information commissioner.Asked if there was a risk of Cambridge Analytica or Facebook destroying evidence, Denham said on Sky News: “As this point we’re not satisfied with the cooperation we’re getting from Cambridge Analytica, so the next step is for us to apply to the court and to do an audit to get some answers as to whether data was misused and shared inappropriately.”British Parliament Culture Committee Chairman Damian Collins said: “This is a matter for the authorities. Facebook sent in data analysts and lawyers who they appointed. What they intended to do there, who knows? The concern would have been, were they removing information or evidence which could have been vital to the investigation? It’s right they stood down but it’s astonishing they were there in the first place.”Denham said Facebook itself will be subject to an investigation over its actions, saying: “We are looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data they acted robustly and whether or not people were informed.”In the U.S., Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) has called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) sent a letter to the Facebook CEO to inquire about the company’s policies for sharing user data with third parties. It’s unlikely Zuckerberg will appear before Congress, as the company usually sends lawyers in place of company figures.Congress has also called on Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix to be hauled in for questioning. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said it was particularly pressing for Nix to be interviewed after reports that the academic who worked on the data-harvesting tool, Aleksandr Kogan, also received grants from the Russian government to research Facebook users’ emotional states.Schiff said: “Reports that an American professor with links to Russia was at the center of this illicit transfer of information raises further questions, which the committee must investigate. Despite our request, and as set out in our status report, the committee has not had the opportunity to talk with numerous Cambridge Analytica personnel who may have knowledge of this and other issues—they must now be brought in for interviews.”Nix is accused of lying to the British parliament, where he claimed his company hadn’t collected any personal data without people’s consent via Facebook, but it’s not clear what punishment that would incur. If brought before Congress, he would be under oath and obliged to tell the truth.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

They misused that data. That data was processed by psychologists who were going back and forth between London and Russia, who are also working on projects in Russia for Russians.“This company was using this data meanwhile as it was talking to the second largest oil company of Russia [and] sending work that I was doing to the CEO of Lukoil, which has known links with the Russian FSB ,which is their state security services. I think we need to step back for a second and depoliticize this because this is about the safety of Americans and the integrity of the American democratic process.”Wylie also told CNN that Cambridge Analytica tested possible Trump slogans, such as “drain the swamp” and “build that wall,” as early as 2014—before his presidential run was announced. Wylie said: “A lot of these narratives which at the time would have seemed crazy for a mainstream candidate to run on, those were the things we were finding there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to. Steve Bannon knew that, because we were doing the research on it.”“We were testing these narratives well before Trump even announced.”Meanwhile, a new whistleblower and former Facebook insider told The Guardian that hundreds of millions of people are likely to have had their data harvested by companies using similar methods as Cambridge Analytica. He said he warned warned senior executives at the company that its poor data protection risked a major breach.“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” said Sandy Parakilas.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Okay, Democrats. It’s time.Sunday afternoon at 1:37 pm, the president of the United States tweeted that he is ordering an investigation of the investigation into him. His campaign, okay; but him. Think about that.Imagine that Hillary Clinton were president and the Republicans were investigating the Clinton Foundation, and she ordered an investigation into that investigation, charging, based on no evidence whatsoever, that the FBI had improperly infiltrated the foundation. And no, this professor is not “proof” of “infiltration.” And anyway, if the FBI has credible reason to believe a crime may have been committed, isn’t infiltration of the enterprise suspected of criminality…their job?Or imagine that Barack Obama had ordered an investigation into any of the various investigations of the Benghazi consular attack. Or for that matter that George W. Bush had ordered an investigation into the investigation into the Valerie Plame outing.In any of those cases, Washington would have exploded. But now this president—who, it is documented, has spent 40 years lying to and defrauding people in business, and who lies nearly every time he speaks—and his apologists have so corrupted our system that some people are discussing Trump’s move as if it’s legitimate. Just another interesting twist and turn in Donald Trump’s Washington, ha ha.No. It’s not. It’s a scandal. It’s the biggest sign yet that Trump knows and respects no law and will use every tool he can to thwart an investigation that is obviously legitimate. We learned over the weekend from the Times that Russia may not be the half of it, a Gulf emissary reportedly offered to help Trump win the election. Again, the August 2016 meeting involving Donald Trump Jr., Erik Prince, and people from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel (what a troika!) is not denied by Trump spokespeople; nor, so far, is the fact that Don Jr. “responded approvingly” to their offers of help. Boom. That alone is collusion and is illegal. As even Steve Bannon knows, if you’re part of a presidential campaign, you call the FBI the moment you even receive such an offer.With each revelation, Trump becomes more unhinged and more accusatory and thinks up new ways to try to discredit the FBI and entire principle of independent investigations of the executive branch. He and his campaign almost certainly cheated, and all he does—this is the president of the United States—is lie and turn the tables, trying to delegitimize the entire Department of Justice.Democrats: what say you? I looked Monday morning at Chuck Schumer’s Twitter feed. He retweeted a couple tweets from his Senate colleague Mark Warner about Republicans in Congress “who are trying to obstruct Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation and could be coming close to crossing a legal line.” But nothing about Trump. Nancy Pelosi sent out one tweet criticizing Trump’s Sunday afternoon tweet. Warner, who is the leading Democrat on the Senate intel committee, wrote a few tweets, less about Trump than about Congress. His House counterpart, Adam Schiff, was more direct:This is all okay as far as it goes, but the country needs more from them. Lately there’s been some chatter about whether Democrats want to talk about Trump heading into the midterms. My colleagues Sam Stein and Gideon Resnick reported that congressional Democrats were refusing to go on cable shows because they want to talk about prescription drug prices but cable wants to talk about Trump. Then I reported that four leading Democratic presidential hopefuls seemed to go out of their way at a major liberal conference to avoid mentioning the president.This is a guaranteed losing strategy. Candidates campaigning in districts can talk about prescription drugs and other matters all they want. This will happen well below the radar of cable news shows, but voters will hear them. Meanwhile, the national party has to talk about Trump. If a narrative develops between now and November that the Democrats want to be “careful” about how they speak of Trump, core Democratic voters will be demoralized and disgusted.I can hear the answer back: We’re letting Mueller take care of that. If and when he issues a report before Election Day, we’ll pounce. That’s too cautious. It depends on the actions of someone else. It’s not enough. I’m sure they’d also say we don’t want to get sucked into the impeachment trap, seem like we’re too eager to impeach Trump. But that’s easily enough avoided. All they need to say is we’ll follow the evidence and see where it leads.But the point they need to emphasize is that unlike the Republicans, they’ll look for the evidence. They’ll look into the Trump Hotel. They’ll haul Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke and Ben Carson up before Congress to explain things. They’ll focus on what’s been happening at the Veterans’ Administration. They’ll investigate policies and outcomes, from the environment to the tax bill (oversight can be “substantive” too, and thus seen as not just “political”). They’ll investigate this Jakarta thing, which has barely been discussed in the media but which alone would have floored this city in normal times. And yes, you bet they’ll investigate the campaign.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'body': 'Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is joining President Donald Trump’s personal legal team to help with Special Counsel Bob Mueller’s probe into potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election, The Washington Post reported on Thursday. News that the two had been discussing a role was first reported by The Daily Beast earlier in the day. Though talks had been ongoing, a formal announcement was delayed by a slew of foreign policy matters that took over much of the president’s time and agenda. A source familiar with the arrangement said that Trump had been preoccupied by North Korea and Syria, which limited his availability to speak with potential new members of his legal team. Giuliani told the Post that he was joining the team “because I hope we can negotiate an end to this for the good of the country and because I have high regard for the president and for Bob Mueller.” In a statement, the president said: “Rudy is great. He has been my friend for a long time and wants to get this matter quickly resolved for the good of the country.”And Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow added: “I have had the privilege of working with Mayor Giuliani\xa0for many years,\xa0and we welcome\xa0his expertise.\xa0Mayor Giuliani expressed his deep appreciation to the President for allowing him to assist in this important matter.” Sekulow additionally announced the hiring of Jane Serene\xa0Raskin\xa0and\xa0Marty\xa0Raskin—both former federal prosecutors—to join the president’s legal team.Trump has had notable difficulties in recruiting new lawyers. And in the former New York City Mayor, he has brought on board a close ally with strong roots in the legal world. Giuliani served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York during the 1980s. But his past several decades have been spent predominantly in politics. During the 2016 election, Giuliani campaigned with Trump and gave an impassioned speech in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. “What I did for New York City, Donald Trump will do for America,” he said at the convention. “I have known Donald Trump for almost 30 years. And he has created and accomplished great things. But beyond that this is a man with a big heart. Every time New York City suffered a tragedy, Donald Trump was there to help.”After Trump’s victory, however, Giuliani wasn’t selected for any cabinet post, leaving him on the outside of an administration he’d helped elect. Axios reported last summer that Trump had considered replacing Attorney General Jeff Sessions with Giuliani. But that too never happened. The former mayor has largely stayed out of public view since then and has said little, if anything, about the Mueller-led investigation. Giuliani previously represented Reza Zarrab, a Turkish businessman charged with participating in a scheme to evade American sanctions on Iran. Zarrab testified in federal court last November that two of his lawyers––presumably Giuliani and Michael Mukasey––tried to negotiate his release through a prisoner swap with Turkey. A federal judge called one of Giuliani’s affidavits about Zarrab’s alleged crimes “surprisingly disingenuous.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Congressman Pushed Bills That Would’ve Helped Drug Company He Owns',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) has sponsored several bills that would have benefited a drug company in which he is the lead shareholder, a Daily Beast investigation has found.Collins is also trying to make changes to a government program that would save the company millions of dollars if its drug is approved by the FDA. \xa0Collins’s office says he doesn’t believe his bills represent a conflict of interest, but he is already accused by independent Office of Congressional Ethics of violating House ethics rules and U.S. securities law for his dealings with the drug company.The Daily Beast found at least four bills that Collins drafted or sponsored that would have directly affected the drug company, Innate Immunotherapeutics:A 2013 bill that would have appropriated more money to an NIH grant program from which Innate previously received $300,000. A 2016 bill that made it easier for drug companies to be granted FDA status to begin drug trials, which Innate received last year. A 2017 bill that would allow drug companies to use a new research method in clinical trials, which Innate would have benefitted from.A 2017 draft bill that would have changed the 340B drug discount program to exclude patients who need expensive “infusion” drugs like Innate’s. The House Ethics Committee was told to investigate Collins by the Office of Congressional Ethics over his dealings with Innate, but the committee has yet to begin a formal investigation. The bills that would have affected Innate should prompt the committee to immediately begin its investigation, said Craig Holman of Public Citizen, a non-profit government watchdog.“I am baffled as to the type of reasoning that the ethics committee came up with in declining to dismiss but not formally start their investigation, other than that it is a partisan deadlock: The Democrats want to pursue the investigation and the Republicans are stonewalling it,” said Holman, who has previously filed complaints regarding Collins’s conduct with the committee and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Collins did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but denied through a spokesperson that any of the bills reviewed by The Daily Beast represent a conflict of interest or potential ethics violation. Targeted program for the poorCollins entered Congress in 2013 after years as a county executive and businessman in the Buffalo, New York area, where he still owns or partly owns several companies. Innate Immunotherapeutics is an Australian pharmaceutical company started in the mid-aughts. Around 2002, Collins invested in Innate and was named a director. Today he owns almost 17 percent of the company. (In 2017, almost 30 percent of Innate was owned by Collins, his children, chief of staff, and a circle of political donors, friends and several fellow congressman, some of whom still own stock in the company.)Innate’s lone drug, MIS416, is an experimental treatment for secondary multiple sclerosis which failed its second clinical trial in June 2017, prompting Innate’s stock to plummet. The same week, the FDA approved MIS416 for clinical trials in the United States, which Innate had been seeking for years. Innate would be saved if the FDA approves MIS416, a so-called “infusion” drug that is administered intravenously and would be one of the only treatments for the disease, worth tens of millions of dollars.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Collins has targeted infusion drugs for removal from a federal program called 340B. The program requires pharmaceutical companies that participate in Medicaid to sell drugs to certain hospitals at deep discounts, some as much as 50 percent. The majority of those drugs are infusion drugs like Innate’s MIS416, which treat deadly diseases and are the some of the most expensive on the market with some individual sessions costing tens of thousands of dollars. Collins has sought to remove infusion drugs by changing the “patient definition,” of 340B, according to a summary of a bill he drafted in 2017 that was obtained by The Daily Beast. The change would require drugs purchased with 340B discounts to only go to uninsured patients. Since most patients receiving infusion drugs are insured, removing them from 340B would remove infusion drugs from the program. Those drugs represent 70 to 80 percent of all drugs purchased through 340B—or more than $8 billion in lost hospital revenue per year, according to Madeline Wallack, a former official at the Department of Health and Human Services who worked on 340B at the agency and now runs a consulting firm that helps hospitals maximize the program’s benefits. That money would go directly back to pharmaceutical companies like Innate.“Any changes that Collins introduces are a distraction from the fact that the product that his company is developing, the launch price for his product would have been very high,” Wallack said of MIS416. “Drug companies and people like Collins want to limit who gets infused drugs because those are the most expensive ones. It’s a big distraction from the fact that the pharmaceutical industry wants to do everything they can to keep drug prices high.”“Drug companies and people like Collins want to limit who gets infused drugs because those are the most expensive ones. It’s a big distraction from the fact that the pharmaceutical industry wants to do everything they can to keep drug prices high.”— ex-HHS official Madeline WallackCollins’ proposed change means billions of dollars in additional profits for drug companies each year, the same amount of losses for hospitals and, if Innate’s drug wouldn’t have failed, millions in additional profits the company.Collins’ spokesperson, Sarah Minkel, did not respond to whether the congressman’s proposed change to the patient definition represents a conflict of interest, instead citing the drug’s failure.“Again, MIS416 failed its 2B trial, suspending any further development,” Minkel said. But MIS416 had promise in 2013, when Collins first began targeting 340B. On the House floor that year Collins said 340B hospitals were “cheating” by maximizing profits from the program. “In regards to 340B, Collins is seeking transparency in a program that has very little oversight,” Minkel said. “Hospital profits from 340B discounts are supposed to benefit indigent populations. There is no mechanism within the federal government to ensure that.”But 340B already benefits those populations, according to Wallack. By purchasing drugs at the 340B discount, selling them at full price to insured patients who can afford them and pocketing the difference, hospitals are able make up for losses incurred by treating the very “indigent populations” Collins says he wants to help, Wallack said.“340B is a gift, and I mean that because the bearer of the burden is the drug industry; it’s not on the government to come up with any funding,” Wallack said. “If they do away with this gift, what’s going to happen in another couple years is we’re going to have to come up with another way to combat the incredibly high prices of these drugs, and manufacturers are not going to say, Well, let’s go back to 340B.”Sponsored pro-pharma billsPrior to Collins’ work on 340B, he crafted legislation that has both a broad effect on industries and a specific effect on businesses he partially owns, including Innate. In 2013, the first bill he sponsored in Congress called for the removal of penalties put in place by Obamacare that fined businesses with more than 50 employees who didn’t offer health insurance to those employees. Then and now, Collins owns as much as $1 million in two such companies—Zeptometrix, a medical device company that employs between 51 and 200 people, and Chembio Diagnostic Systems, another medical device company that employs more than 50 people.The second bill Collins sponsored in 2013 would have appropriated for more funds to be made available through the National Institutes of Health to scientists and researchers looking to get their drugs to market. Praised by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the bill would have been beneficial to small companies like Innate that take huge risks on drugs to treat incurable diseases like MS. In fact, Innate's drug had\xa0already been used in a study that later benefitted from NIH grants\xa0when Collins crafted the bill.In 2009, Innate CEO Simon Wilkinson travelled to Buffalo where he sought investors for the company. There, Wilkinson met a scientist at the Roswell Park Cancer Center, Kunle Odunsi, who in 2011, was awarded a grant of more than $300,000 from the NIH’s National Cancer Institute to continue a trial that had begun in 2010 using Innate’s drug, MIS416. (The drug was used in the first phase of the trial, which sought to treat ovarian cancer in mice, but not the second, NIH-funded phase.)“Scientists often need a funding boost to take the initial steps to see if their invention or concept has the potential to be commercialized,” Collins said in a press release about the bill, called the TRANSFER Act. “Without this critical legwork, a scientist is often unable to partner with a business or an investor to take their idea to the next level.”Collins followed the TRANSFER Act with a 2015 bill that allowed drug companies and medical-device manufacturers to use 3D human tissue models (essentially manufactured human tissue) in trials before applying for FDA approval. (The bill went nowhere, but Collins introduced a virtually identical bill in 2017.) \xa03D tissue modeling has already netted significant results in MS research, which Innate’s drug sought to treat. The NIH considers 3D modelling so important that it recently awarded $30 million in grants to study and develop 3D methods. In May 2017, a team of researchers in Texas was the first to print 3D models of MS brain lesions, hailed as a breakthrough in the field of MS research. Without addressing the relationship between 3D modelling and MS research, Collins’ office once again pointed to Innate’s stock value in explaining why Collins’ bill didn’t represent a conflict of interest.At the time Collins introduced the 3D modeling bill, however, Innate’s drug wasn’t a failure. In March 2015, the company informed its shareholders that MIS416 had “prolonged survival” in the cancerous mice from Odunsi’s study and that Innate was “strengthening” its intellectual property rights by patenting the drug in numerous countries as a treatment for MS and cancer. While most of Collins’s conflicted legislation that would have affected his companies has had little success, he did succeed in getting the 21st Century Cures Act made into law. As The Daily Beast previously reported, the bill streamlined the grant process for FDA investigational new drug status, which at the time Innate was seeking. The company was granted that status in June 2017, six days before it announced that its second clinical trial was a failure. Collins played a direct role in passage of the bill, which also secured more NIH funds for drug research, including at the Roswell Park Cancer Center, he noted following the Cures Act’s passage.At issue is whether Collins’s bills would affect many companies, a small group of them, or Collins’ businesses alone, according to Larry Noble of the Campaign Legal Center, a government watchdog. “If you can show these bills have a broader effect on the industry and not just a specific one on your company, it’s not a direct conflict of interest for you to be working or voting on that legislation,” Noble said. “That’s a loophole in the law, and it shows that the law isn’t strong enough.”Again, Collins’ office argued that the failure of Innate’s drug means none of Collins’ bills represent a conflict of interest. Noble disagreed.“If there was a conflict of interest when he was involved in this legislation, it still exists,” he said. “Just because the company wasn’t successful doesn’t mean it’s not a conflict of interest.”Correction, 4/17/18: A previous version of this story referred to Kunle Odunsi as an Innate investor and said Innate’s drug was used in the NIH study. We regret the error."},
 {'title': 'U.S. Counterterrorism Spending Since 9/11 Adds Up to at Least $2.8 Trillion',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "By Julia DonheiserThe United States has spent a lot of money on counterterrorism since the 9/11 attacks. But nobody has been keeping good track of just how much, until now.A bipartisan group of national security and budget experts convened by the Stimson Center estimated in a new report on May 16 that the cumulative tally is at least $2.8 trillion, and that the annual spending rate—while less than it used to be—still amounts to about 15 percent of the nation’s discretionary budget.The pace has slowed since 2008, when counterterrorism expenditures by the State, Defense, Homeland Security and other federal departments reached an estimated $260 billion—or 277 percent more than the rate in 2002, the report said. In 2017, that annual spending rate stood around $175 billion.But there’s still a lot of uncertainty surrounding these tallies, partly because no one in the government is assigned to produce an official account of all that spending. And what can be gleaned from public documents about U.S. counterterrorism activities doesn’t include classified spending,and also omits some military, intelligence and domestic security spending that lies in a gray zone with multiple purposes.Luke Hartig, one of the report’s authors and a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council under the Obama Administration, suggested at a panel discussion at the Stimson Center that the absence of transparency was partly deliberate.“Transparency would force harder questions about appropriations” from Congress, Hartig said. While the relatively low number of attacks and casualties does not equate to a tiny threat, Hartig said, “it still merits the question of whether $2.8 trillion is the optimal amount of resources it takes to mitigate that threat.”The authors of the report raised this issue in the text, noting that since 9/11, only 100 people have been killed by Muslim extremists or jihadists inside the United States, while more than 20,000 fentanyl-related (opioid) deaths occurred in 2016 alone.“Some analysts conclude that spending $2.8 trillion to counter a terrorism threat that has resulted in comparatively few fatalities is a waste of increasingly scarce government resources that are better spent elsewhere,” the report said. “Others may contend that terrorism’s impact is more psychological than physical, or that the low fatality count from terrorism and the lack of another 9/11-scale attack” suggest the money has been well spent. “While the Stimson study group does not take a stance in this debate, it does conclude that arguing either case successfully—that is, determining whether CT [counterterrorism] expenditures have generated enough benefit to justify their cost — is difficult without accurate information about CT spending,” it added.The group recommended that the White House budget office be tasked with developing a comprehensive counterterrorism spending tally, using clear terms and definitions to delineate what qualifies and what does not. “Taking these actions will help to ensure that CT spending is targeted toward programs that are most effective in confronting the terrorist threat,” they said.Besides Hartig, the other members of the group were Amy Belasco, a former defense policy specialist at the Congressional Budget Office; Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense specialist at the American Enterprise Institute; Tina Jonas, a former Defense Department comptroller; Mike McCord, another former Defense Department comptroller; and John Mueller, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Lead Lawyer, John Dowd, Resigns as Mueller Closes In',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The departure of President Donald Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, on Thursday comes at a tumultuous time during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia election meddling—and raises questions about whether additional lawyers may be brought on board. Dowd confirmed his resignation to The Daily Beast, saying: “I love the president and wish him well.” The New York Times reported that he had considered “leaving several times in recent months and ultimately concluded that Mr. Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice.” Trump has stated he’d be willing to sit down with Mueller, which Dowd reportedly thought was “a bad idea.” The resignation comes days after Dowd told The Daily Beast that he would like to see “an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation.” “I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” Dowd emailed The Daily Beast early on Saturday morning.Dowd’s apparent replacement, longtime D.C. lawyer Joe DiGenova, started working on Trump’s legal team earlier this week. It’s likely the two big personalities—Dowd’s and DiGenova’s—would have clashed had Dowd stayed in the team. The change has sparked widespread rumors about who might be next to join the president’s legal team. Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer who does civil liberties work and frequent cable TV appearances, told The Daily Beast he is not interested in the post. “I have no interest in changing my status,” said Dershowitz, who has been largely sympathetic to Trump’s position that the Mueller investigation is a “witch hunt.” On Thursday, prominent Washington D.C. attorney Robert Bennett called on his former law partner Ty Cobb to follow Dowd in leaving the White House’s legal team. “I hope my friend Ty Cobb will leave the team. He’s not helping himself or his reputation,” Bennett told Politico. Cobb, who has represented the White House writ large in response to the Mueller investigation, has similarly called for Trump to cooperate with the probe. It’s unclear how or if the president’s legal strategy will change in Dowd’s absence. Mueller has been building a case related to Trump on obstruction of justice involving the president’s conversation with James Comey about Michael Flynn, according to a source familiar with the probe. In the past, Dowd has expressed concerns about Trump sitting down for an interview with Mueller.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'James Comey spends a good deal of his new book A Higher Loyalty calling out President Donald Trump’s character. In the first interview of his book tour, Comey said Trump is “morally unfit to be president.” So, CNN’s Jake Tapper, asked the former FBI director on Thursday: “Do you think the nation would be better off if Hillary Clinton had won?”“I can’t answer that question,” Comey replied. “That hypothetical is too hard to go back in time to try to answer.” “You paint a pretty dire picture of President Trump. It’s hard to imagine how you don’t think the nation is better off if Hillary Clinton had won,” Tapper said, seemingly confused by his guest’s refusal to answer the question.“I don’t think about it in those terms, Jake,” Comey said. “We have the current president who in my view was legitimately elected, serving as president. The question is, is he adhering to our values? He’s clearly not. I think the first thing to do is not get numb to it.”Pressing him again, Tapper said, “It’s interesting that you won’t go as far as to say that Hillary Clinton would be—that the nation would be better off if Hillary would be president—because you have called for the nation to respond to the challenge of Trump in your view by voting, presumably by voting against what he represents. Is that not a fair interpretation?”“I think of it in terms of voting for something else, which is the core values of this country, which are more important than any policy dispute,” Comey said. So I don’t care whether people find in it a Republican or Democrat or neither. It’s important that the leaders reflect the values because that’s all we are.” During another stop on his media tour this week, Comey told Stephen Colbert that, at least to some degree, he blames those who didn’t vote in the 2016 election for helping to elect Trump. This is despite the fact that as FBI director he chose not to vote for president so maintain some sort of neutrality. He confirmed that he does plan to vote in 2020.Later in their interview, Tapper quoted a passage from Comey’s book in which he says his high school experience gave him a “lifelong hatred of bullies.” The anchor asked, “Do you think President Trump is a bully? And do you hate him?”“I definitely don’t hate him,” Comey said. “There are things he does that make me uncomfortable and I think are inappropriate, that are in some ways bully-like behavior. But I don’t hate Donald Trump. I don’t even dislike Donald Trump.”'},
 {'title': '‘Trump’s Going to War’ Now With His Political Enemies, Boasts Bannon',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Fresh from his incendiary speech to Holocaust revisionist Marine Le Pen’s National Front Party in France, where he urged his wildly cheering audience to wear labels of racism and xenophobia as “a badge of honor,” President Donald Trump’s fired chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon received a somewhat cooler reception Thursday at the Financial Times’ Future of News Conference.However, he was hardly deterred from defending his former boss as “the greatest orator since Williams Jennings Bryan” among other sterling qualities, and predicting that the shakeup of Trump’s legal team, including what Bannon characterized as the firing of Trump attorney John Dowd for not being aggressive enough, portends an escalation of hostilities with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.“I think President Trump’s going to war. I think it’s very obvious he’s going to war on this,” Bannon said about the 45th president, adding criticism of White House lawyer Ty Cobb.“Ty Cobb and John Dowd had a radical theory—‘Let’s totally cooperate and waive executive privilege’,” Bannon said. “I have said, as I told the president, I told everybody, and I told Brother Dowd, I think that’s wrong… I think that’s why, essentially, more aggressive attorneys got brought in”—notably deep state conspiracy theorist Joseph DiGenova, who’s blamed the Russia/collusion investigation on a plot by the FBI to destroy Trump’s presidency.Bannon also predicted that Trump’s vaunted meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un will never happen.“The president may try to make it happen, but the logistics of how\xa0you do it, and where you do it, are quite tough,” Bannon said, adding that only pressure applied by China can influence Kim to cease ramping up North Korea’s nuclear weaponization.Oddly, Bannon also insisted he has no regrets about being the primary source for Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s best-selling take-down of the Trump White House, and claimed the book is accurate.Under a bantering interrogation by FT Editor Lionel Barber, the usually rumpled Bannon—who had cleaned up nicely for the occasion, having shaved and donned pressed khakis and an unwrinkled sports jacket over layers of black shirts—celebrated the so-called “Deplorables” who supported Trump, and reprised his attacks on “the party of Davos” and global elites, Hillary Clinton, “the opposition media” and especially CNN and its worldwide president, Jeff Zucker.“It galls me that somebody like Jeff Zucker can walk in here and sit here and say\xa0that Fox News is a propaganda channel,” Bannon said, citing Zucker’s remarks from earlier in the day, in which the CNN chief compared the Murdoch-controlled, Trump-friendly cable channel unfavorably to the Russian news agency Tass. “I’m not here to defend the Murdochs. They’re big boys. They can defend themselves. But you can’t name a more propaganda outfit than CNN… Every night, it’s hate Trump.”Calling CNN “a disgrace to journalism” for its less than swooning coverage of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, Bannon continued: “I understand that as a business model. You want the ‘hate trump Crowd’ to rally around that. But to come in here and say that another network is propaganda is absolutely, totally absurd. And, by the way, does anybody in the opposition media question him or challenge him? No, they cheer him on.”The 64-year-old Bannon, who briefly returned to his executive chairman post at Breitbart News after losing his White House gig last August—and then was fired in January after he clashed with billionaire Breitbart investors Robert and Rebekah Mercer—also quibbled with the editorial direction of the angry populist web site he had weaponized in 2016 to support Trump’s candidacy athwart the Republican establishment. “The audience is down,” Bannon acknowledged when Barber pointed out that Breitbart’s traffic has been cut in half since Trump’s election. “I think that’s the difference between just doing aggregation and—look, I had a theory: You gotta break news or make news. You have to have a sense of urgency, and people have to feel that they need this information. The site’s a little more aggregation today. I think the guys have a different strategy.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But was she the runner-up in the French election [that made Emmanuel Macron president]? Did 40-some percent of the people in France vote for her? Was I up there to say those people are perfect? They’re not perfect. The ‘Deplorables’ are not perfect. I’m not perfect.”He continued: “I believe in the tenet of the Judeo-Christian West that Man is fallen. We’re not perfect. But those are working class people in France.”Barber pressed: “As a student of history, doesn’t it worry you when a political leader seeks to erase a dark chapter?”“It certainly does. It absolutely does,” Bannon finally conceded."},

  'body': 'A Washington D.C.-based consulting firm that worked with disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s foreign influence outfit is being sued by its own lawyers for more than half a million dollars. The firm, Lewis Baach, filed a lawsuit last month alleging that the consultancy, Sphere Consulting, is delinquent on $572,000 in legal bills for work dating to 2015. Sphere Consulting flatly denies the charges. The lawsuit is just the latest bit of drama for Sphere, which last year found itself fielding questions about its work with Flynn as part of the public relations work it did on behalf of a Turkish government-linked client. Resulting allegations of federal lobbying violations eventually led to Flynn’s resignation from the White House. He has since pleaded guilty to lying to federal prosecutors investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election. Sphere was not accused of any wrongdoing stemming from its work on Flynn’s behalf, but it cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Flynn prior to the guilty plea. It’s not entirely clear what is at the heart of the consulting firm’s dispute with Lewis Baach, which was first reported by Politico. However, a top official for Sphere hinted that it was a matter of overbilling. “Sphere Consulting has been a major source of business referrals to Lewis Baach and is absolutely stunned with the value they placed on their services,” said Jim Courtovich, Sphere’s founder and managing partner, in an email.Since filing its lawsuit, Lewis Baach has offered to settle for $275,000. Courtovich countered with a $200,000 offer, which the law firm rejected. Sphere has yet to file an official answer to the firm’s complaint.Lewis Baach did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.'},

  'body': "EDINBURGH, Scotland—Donald Trump might well be making diplomatic strides in North Korea, but he’s risked destroying relations with Scotland ahead of his expected visit to the country by banning its iconic soft drink, Irn-Bru.The luminous drink—famously more popular in Scotland than Coca-Cola—has been banned from Trump’s luxury golf course over fears that its almost radioactively orange color could ruin the fancy carpets.“We can’t have it staining when to replace the ballroom carpet would be 500,000 pounds ($678,800) alone,” said Trump Turnberry General Manager Ralph Porciani, according to a local newspaper. “We have villas here with Irn-Bru stains in the carpets, which I can’t let.”Irn-Bru is an intensely sweet soft drink with a flavor that’s almost impossible to describe. It’s as much a national icon as whisky or haggis, and Trump’s ban on it is being treated as an attack on the very essence of being Scottish, say a number of furious Scots.One of the country’s leading newspapers, The Scotsman, described the decision as a “an unfortunate stain on Trump’s reputation” and in a justifiably angry editorial wrote, “The resort may have ballroom carpets to protect but surely the stain on Trump’s reputation from this ill-considered decision is much, much worse.”Tim O’Connor wrote on Twitter that the decision was “effectively a declaration of war on Scotland,” while another Twitter user wrote that “only one luminous orange object is allowed at Turnberry,” above a picture of Trump speaking at the resort during the presidential campaign.Scottish journalist Liam Kirkcaldy wrote: “Donald Trump has banned Irn-Bru from his Scottish hotel, despite the fact that it’s one of the few drinks which could survive a nuclear war without being affected. You’d think that would appeal to the man.”Despite Trump’s mother hailing from Scotland, he was widely unpopular in the country even before he became president. He has two golf courses here and was strongly criticized for the way he treated local residents while building his first, near Aberdeen in the north of the country.In an eerie precursor of his later policies, he built a wall around a local resident’s house to block it from view and sent the resident a bill, then cut off water from the 92-year-old resident’s home, and has delivered only a fraction of the $1 billion investment and 6,000 jobs he promised to the area.Scots have already proved inventive in protesting Trump, with previous protests including hoisting a Mexican flag on his golf course, urinating on his golf course’s sign, rubbing a big balloon on Trump’s head, and making all kinds of colorfully worded anti-Trump placards including: “Yer maw was an immigrant you absolute roaster.”Trump is expected to visit Scotland during his trip to the U.K. this summer. It was confirmed last month that Trump will visit on July 13, with the trip expected to include a meeting with the queen.Mass protests are already being organized for the visit. More than 100,000 people have registered their interest on Facebook on a protest against Trump at Downing Street in London on the day of the visit.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

He will also no doubt see that Londoners hold their liberal values of freedom of speech very dear.”"},
 {'title': 'WTF, Mark Warner?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Liberals looking for signs of fight in the Democrats heading into November may want to avoid watching this video of Virginia Senator Mark Warner appearing Wednesday at the Code Conference 2018, a big-deal tech and media conference sponsored by the tech website Recode and held in Rancho Palos Verdes, an absurdly bucolic suburb of Los Angeles.Warner, a telecom millionaire, was among his people. His two questioners got right to the point, asking him about the recent Senate Intelligence Committee report on the extent of Russian hacking of the 2016 election. Then the conversation turned to the various pressures the committee faces.I first got wind of this from a Bloomberg report Wednesday afternoon that carried the ominous and extremely unsettling headline: “Russia Probes Wouldn’t Expand If Democrats Win Congress, Warner Says.”Uh…\xa0what? The top Senate Democrat on the Russia investigation actually said in effect that the Democrats, if they captured the Senate this November, wouldn’t even continue the probe once they took over? The write-up also quoted Warner directly as seeming to equate partisan pressures on the committee from left and right, and expressing the view that Americans “will be tired of it if this is not wound down in this calendar year.”I reached out to Warner’s press office, to be fair and all, because sometimes news stories do take remarks out of context. I was directed to a video of the senator’s appearance, accompanied by a write-up of his session on the conference’s official web site (that’s what I linked to at the top of this column). The context was, shall we say, other than reassuring. Since I bothered to watch the thing (the money part runs from roughly 7:15 to 8:30), I’ll give you the full quote and context, so we can be as fair as possible. It is true that in the section of the speech where he’s discussing these matters, Warner never says in so many words that “probes wouldn’t expand.” But he did make the other remarks attributed to him. First, he said there’s “enormous pressure” on Republicans to shut the probe down. Then he said there’s “a lot of pressure” on Democrats “to call this guy out as guilty tomorrow.” Then he noted that his committee is doing a counter-intelligence investigation, and Robert Mueller is doing a criminal investigation.Then, with no questioning or prompting, he shifted gears and said: “But I do think the notion for those who may be partisans in the crowd say, ‘Well, gosh if the Democrats take control, they’ll be able to really ramp these up’…\xa0I think the American public will be tired of it if this is not wound down in this calendar year.”No amount of context can change the meaning of that. In fact, the conference’s in-house reporter, who once worked at CNN, knew exactly what to put in his lead paragraph: “The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee made an argument that is often pushed by conservatives: The American people would get “tired” of the Russia probe by the end of the year.”What in the world is the leading Senate Democrat on this matter doing talking like that? For one thing, it’s terrible politics. Democrats are tying themselves in the usual knots trying to figure out how to talk about Donald Trump on the campaign trail. They seem to think it’s either “don’t mention his name” or “impeach, impeach, impeach!” They’re terrified of being branded as crazed for impeachment, so they, or some of them, overcompensate in the direction of saying nothing.But there’s a middle ground that doesn’t seem too hard to me. Don’t use the word impeachment, so Republicans can’t even cut a cynically edited ad; but say things like, “We’re going to investigate the administration thoroughly, from Russia to the family business to the EPA and HUD to who’s really benefiting from the tax bill, and we’ll see what we turn up and move forward from there.” That will satisfy most (not all, but most) liberals and sound completely responsible to swing voters. So Democrats can—and must—handle this question without being afraid to mention Trump’s name, or their base voters will be deeply dispirited.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But there’s an even more important reason not to say what Warner said than electoral positioning. The future of the country is now clearly at stake. With this Spygate nonsense, Trump and his abettors have made plain that there is no lie they won’t tell to keep Trump in power, and no norm or institution they won’t trash or subvert. To promise not to investigate this president into the next calendar year because the people will be tired of it is to promise not to perform the duty of protecting the Constitution. Warner, like every senator, took an oath of office that begins: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic...” [my italics].We can begin to see now where this is headed. Mueller will indeed, it’s my guess, work into next year, perhaps well into next year; he looks like he has lots of rocks still to turn over (will Warner criticize him for going on too long?). He will issue a report that may not call for indicting a sitting president but that could well be sweeping and devastating in all kinds of ways. If it’s illegal and this crowd didn’t do it, it’s only because they didn’t think of it or didn’t have the time.At that point will commence a ferocious pushback campaign to destroy Mueller, his team, his findings, everything. You say that’s already started? It has, but next year it’s going to be like nothing we’ve seen so far. That’s when Warner and his colleagues, the Republican ones especially, are going to have to take a stand in defense of the law. I think we know how much we ought to count on the Republicans. That will put all the more weight on the shoulders of the Democrats, especially the one who might be chairing the most relevant Senate committee. Protecting the Constitution takes as long as it takes, whether people “tire of it” or not."},
 {'title': 'Comey Pushed for the Investigation That Ended McCabe’s Career',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "James Comey appears to have inadvertently played a role in his deputy Andrew McCabe’s expulsion from the FBI. According to a source familiar with the investigation that led to McCabe’s firing, Comey—then FBI director—asked the bureau’s internal Inspection Division to look into an\xa0Oct. 30, 2016, Wall Street Journal story that included leaks from inside the bureau. The Inspection Division took on the case and started trying to determine who was responsible for the leak. When they realized McCabe, the bureau’s deputy director, was a likely culprit, they handed off the investigation to the Justice Department’s inspector general, according to an IG report released late last week. Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited that detailed IG report when he announced McCabe had been fired barely before he was eligible for his retirement. Comey’s role brings a new dimension to a high-profile, headline-grabbing Washington controversy that pitted Republicans against Democrats and bureau veterans against the White House. Shortly after his firing, McCabe released a statement saying it was due to President Donald Trump’s “ongoing war” with the bureau. Trump has suggested that Comey and McCabe conspired to keep Americans from knowing the truth about corruption in the bureau. “McCabe is Comey!” Trump once tweeted. Comey’s role in the genesis of the investigation that led to McCabe’s firing undermines that characterization.And, of course, it comes as Comey is hawking his new book, A Higher Loyalty, which details the conversations he had with President Trump before his firing.A lawyer for Comey and a spokesperson for McCabe both declined to comment. That inspector general report says that sometime in May 2017, the Inspection Division expanded a pre-existing probe into media leaks to include an effort to determine “the source of the information” in that 2016 Wall Street Journal story. The Journal piece referred to a conversation between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official about the Clinton Foundation investigation. McCabe told the IG that he privately authorized one of his deputies and an official in the FBI’s public affairs office to describe a conversation to the Journal between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official. That conversation was very tense, according to McCabe. In the conversation, the DOJ official asked McCabe why FBI agents were pursuing the Clinton Foundation investigation. “Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?” McCabe replied. “Of course not,” the DOJ official replied, after a pause. The story that followed left Comey deeply upset because it highlighted extraordinary tensions between senior leadership at the bureau and a top official at Justice Department headquarters, according to the IG report. Comey raised concerns about the article in a staff meeting the next day.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.We “need to figure out how to get our folks to understand why leaks hurt our organization,” Comey said, according to notes taken by one of McCabe’s aides and revealed in the IG report. McCabe and Comey later discussed the piece in person. The two men gave the inspector general vastly different characterizations of that conversation. In McCabe’s version, McCabe told Comey that he authorized the two FBI officials to share details of the conversation about the Clinton Foundation investigation with the Journal. Comey “did not react negatively, just kind of accepted it,” according to McCabe. In Comey’s version, however, McCabe never told him he authorized the leaks to the Journal. Comey was “very concerned” about the story and thought it would be toxic for the FBI’s relationship with Justice Department headquarters. And according to Comey, McCabe said he had nothing to do with it. “I have a strong impression he conveyed to me, ‘it wasn’t me, boss,’” Comey told the inspector general. Comey also told the IG that he didn’t think McCabe was one of the Journal’s sources. McCabe’s own chief of staff also didn’t think McCabe participated in the story. “[I]t really, highlights a dysfunction between the FBI and the, and DOJ,” McCabe’s chief of staff told the inspectors. “And to that end, it doesn’t really serve the greater good.” The inspector general’s report ultimately concluded that Comey’s recollection of the Comey/McCabe conversation was the correct one, and that McCabe lacked candor with Comey about his role in the Oct. 30 article. “We found it highly unlikely that Comey, in a discussion with McCabe that same day, would have been accepting of a disclosure authorized by McCabe that looked exactly like the type of leak that he was condemning to his staff,” the report says. “McCabe’s disclosure was an attempt to make himself look good by making senior department leadership, specifically the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, look bad,” the report added. “We found it highly unlikely that Comey, in a discussion with McCabe that same day, would have been accepting of a disclosure... that looked exactly like the type of leak that he was condemning to his staff.”— DOJ inspector general reportMcCabe’s sacking set off a political firestorm. It came after a series of tweets from Trump criticizing him, and in the wake of reports in right-wing media highlighting McCabe’s wife’s candidacy for the Virginia Senate as a Democrat. Despite the timing, Justice Department officials point to the IG report as the justification for McCabe’s termination. In the days after McCabe’s termination, one of Trump’s personal lawyers—who has since left his legal team—told The Daily Beast that it was time to end Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation into potential coordination between Trump associates and the Kremlin. “I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” John Dowd said the morning after McCabe’s firing.Comey didn’t manufacture the Russia probe based on the so-called Steele dossier. But he did play a role in kicking off the investigation that led to McCabe’s firing. "},
 {'title': 'Mike Pompeo Threatens Iran, Offers Treaty for Massive Disarmament',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Now that President Donald Trump has ripped up the Iranian nuclear deal over the objections of European allies, his new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, unveiled the outlines of a post-deal Iran policy. In a bellicose speech Monday, his first as the U.S.’ chief diplomat, Pompeo indicated that the Trump administration believes its “Maximum Pressure” campaign on North Korea has worked and seeks a similar template for Iran. Pompeo said the U.S. would place substantial “pressure” on Tehran, to include “crush[ing]” Iranian operatives “and their Hezbollah proxies” worldwide; described the return of U.S. sanctions, unilateral this time, crippling the Iranian economy; and threatened unspecified “steely resolve” should Iran not accede to what “we demand from Iran.”Those demands were a maximal list familiar to Iran hawks and go far beyond the terms of the now-scotched deal. Iran, Pompeo envisioned, ought to fully declare and then abandon past nuclear work, give international nuclear inspectors “unqualified access to all sites around the country,” halt its missile program, release U.S. and allied citizens from its jails, “end support” for Mideast terrorist groups, demobilize the Iraqi Shiite militias it supports, withdraw from Syria, cease aid for the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Houthis in Yemen, release al-Qaeda personnel in Iran, and cease threatening U.S. allies in Israel and the Gulf. “These are twelve very basic requirements,” Pompeo said, adding that a “treaty” would be “our preferred way to go.” Yet Pompeo recognized that since the Trump administration is the geopolitical outlier in rejecting the Iran deal, he will be twisting the arms of European allies to join Trump’s new policy. Pompeo said he would send a “teams of specialists” to “listen” and educate European capitals on joining U.S. sanctions, something the French, British, and Germans have all but ruled out of hand, but will “hold those doing prohibited business with Iran to account. … we can’t generate wealth for Qassem Soleimani,” the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. But Pompeo also gestured at Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—which have cultivated the Trump team substantially and all of which consider Iran an existential threat—as the allies it will listen to on its Iran policy. The strategic concept Pompeo outlined was the opposite of the one underlying the Iran deal, which sought to verifiably close Iran’s technological pathways to a nuclear weapon and was agnostic on all other aspects of Iranian domestic or foreign policy. “Iran’s nuclear aspirations cannot be separated from the overall security picture,” he said, telling Tehran to “look at our diplomacy with North Korea” should it doubt Trump’s willingness to negotiate, even as the preliminary diplomacy ahead of a June 12 summit seems rocky. “I’m not gonna share with you precisely what our response will be” if Iranian resumes enrichment activity, Pompeo said.

 {'title': 'Trump Gets the National Security Adviser McMaster Tried to Prevent',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "H.R. McMaster went into Donald Trump’s White House an unexpected, out-of-place fit whom his security-field allies hoped would restrain the president. He exits it without an active military career and with his long-cultivated reputation for integrity tarnished by his tumultuous year working for Trump. And McMaster turns his job over to a right-wing foreign policy expert considered all but bloodthirsty and eager to encourage Trump’s most hawkish instincts—exactly the sort of figure McMaster’s many allies in defense circles feared would rapidly emerge in the wake of McMaster’s departure.Late Thursday afternoon, Trump finally pushed McMaster out, the culmination of an agonizing few weeks of humiliating leaks that the Army three-star general was a dead man walking.From the start, McMaster was an accidental national security adviser, hired abruptly after Mike Flynn flamed out and a different senior officer turned Trump down. His Washington—and global—profile was as a straightjacket on a president with whom he shared neither history, experience or temperament.It was a circumstance bound to make their relationship a test of wills. And it proved to be a painful coda on an extraordinary career that saw McMaster become known as a unicorn of a senior military officer: someone who fought the Army’s instincts, refuted its perceived wisdom, and won. That status, forged in the Iraq war, made McMaster’s subordinate position appear all the more excruciating.Hours after he was finally dismissed by Trump, McMaster received a tribute from his most important mentor. “General McMaster has served our country admirably—and selflessly and forthrightly—as President Trump’s national security adviser,” David Petraeus, the retired Army general and former CIA director, told The Daily Beast. It was Petraeus, in 2008, who ensured the Army gave the iconoclastic McMaster his first star. “He established and oversaw an impressive process for providing options to the president. He helped develop a number of important initiatives for the fight against Islamist extremists, malign Iranian activity, and North Korea’s threatening nuclear and missile programs. And he guided the drafting of a superb National Security Strategy—in less than a year. Again, he has served our country very well.”McMaster’s successor, John Bolton, is as near a polar opposite as Trump could have found for national security adviser. The former UN ambassador long has had a personal chemistry and rapport with the president in ways McMaster lacked. According to sources close to Trump, the president routinely talks about Bolton even when Bolton isn’t around, and wonders what he would have to say on policy discussions related to North Korea, Iran, and China. Trump administration sources also tell The Daily Beast that in recent days and weeks, a steady cast of the president’s most prominent advisers and allies—including Rep. Mark Meadows and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—had been talking up the former UN ambassador. But Bolton was still surprised when he heard he landed the job. The two had discussed it for a while. But the offer was only made once Bolton showed up at the White House on Thursday afternoon. Hours later, Bolton was on Fox News, his new boss’s favorite channel, talking about his new gig.Bolton, who avoided military service in Vietnam, was a proponent of the Iraq war during George W. Bush’s administration. McMaster, as a colonel in a corner of Ninewa province called Tal Afar, labored to salvage its wreckage. McMaster spent his White House tenure trying to save the Iran nuclear deal from Trump. Bolton delights in encouraging Trump to rip it up. In the White House meetings the two have had over the past weeks, Bolton has reiterated his position that nuclear deal is not one that can be “fixed” and that withdrawal as soon as possible is the best course of action, according to two people briefed on their conversations. “H.R. McMaster served our country with honor for over 30 years, none of them more trying or important than the year he served as national security adviser. The nation is far less secure with his departure.”— John NaglGet The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.While McMaster’s first speech to the National Security Council staff instructed his team to avoid the Trump-beloved phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” which he said castigated an “entire religion,” Bolton wrote the foreword to a book by anti-Islam bigots Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer. The website of his political action committee urges supporters to “Defeat And Destroy Radical Islam Now.” (Another prominent Islamophobe, Frank Gaffney—who once concocted a sweaty theory that Petraeus had submitted to Sharia Law—has been for weeks blast-emailing reporters exhortations to Trump to fire McMaster, with Thursday morning’s edition including the words “Carpe Diem.”)The only issue where McMaster appears to align with Bolton is on a preventive attack on North Korea, a position that both disappointed McMaster’s allies and which contradicts Trump’s desire to place a more hardline team in place ahead of Trump’s meeting with Kim Jong-un. “H.R. McMaster served our country with honor for over 30 years, none of them more trying or important than the year he served as national security adviser,” said John Nagl, McMaster’s friend, fellow Army-officer veteran of Iraq and counterinsurgency theorist-practitioner. “The nation is far less secure with his departure.” Trump, who is loath to fire his subordinates, let McMaster twist in the political wind for weeks. Rumors swirled that General Vincent Brooks might soon leave his command of U.S. forces in Korea, freeing up McMaster for a fourth star and a final, face-saving assignment. Instead, McMaster has opted to retire, raising questions over whether Trump offered him a path to continued service—or if McMaster had had enough. McMaster’s generalship was famously hard-won, coming only on the personal intervention of Petraeus against Army leadership, at the height of Petraeus’ influence. McMaster’s most lasting policy impact may have doomed his relationship with Trump. McMaster convinced Trump, against the president’s instincts, to escalate the nearly 17-year old war in Afghanistan, a plan that has satisfied few on either the left or the right. The military and diplomatic commitments McMaster prevailed on Trump to undertake will be the hardest policy for Bolton to unravel—should the consistently bellicose Bolton even desire it. While McMaster has presided over the drastic escalation of aerial bombing in Afghanistan, Bolton goes a step further, urging Trump in November to ignore an international war-crimes investigation. The longer McMaster stayed in the White House, the more his allies on the outside bit their tongues, in the hope that his increasingly vocal Trumpism was the cost of doing Trump-restraining business. McMaster and another now-departed White House aide, Gary Cohn, even wrote a tendentious op-ed purporting to reconcile Trump’s America-first unilateralism with traditional U.S. internationalism. Some took to saying that McMaster’s book Dereliction of Duty, his scathing attack on a docile Johnson-era Joint Chiefs of Staff that acquiesced to the Vietnam disaster instead of standing up to the delusions of the president, was going to need a major new foreword on future editions. But not even McMaster’s friends, including Nagl, could stomach the general’s decision to defend Trump divulging intelligence provided by Israel on Islamic State to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the White House. McMaster, dressed in a business suit but throwing his stars on the table, publicly called the shocking decision “wholly appropriate.” In an NPR interview, a horrified Nagl invoked the West Point Honor Code to say his friend had not been truthful. Still, Nagl said: “I think literally the fate of the Earth could be in H.R. McMaster’s hands at this point.”More recently, McMaster reasserted his distance from Trump on Russia. The national-security strategy McMaster constructed treated Russia as an adversary—despite Trump—though its future under Bolton is now in doubt. Last month, McMaster earned himself a rebuke from Trump on Twitter after saying that Russian interference in the 2016 election was “incontrovertible.” Nevertheless, in what now proves to be McMaster’s final speech as Trump’s national security adviser, McMaster blasted Russia as “complicit” in human-rights atrocities in Syria. Asked what McMaster was likely to do in the next chapter of his life, Nagl told The Daily Beast: Dereliction of Duty II: President Trump and the End of American Leadership.—with additional reporting by Asawin Suebsaeng"},

  'body': 'Immigration and Customs Enforcement is ending its practice of automatically releasing pregnant women from detention, according to internal communications reviewed by The Daily Beast. This is because of President Donald Trump’s executive order “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” which requires stricter enforcement of immigration laws. Previously, the agency’s general practice was to release women from detention who were pregnant. Now, pregnant women will only be able to get released if an ICE officer determines so on a case-by-case basis.Pregnant women were still sometimes detained under the previous internal guidelines. Immigrants’ rights advocates say the practice is dangerous to women and to their unborn children, and that pregnant women are more likely to miscarry if they’re in detention than if they are free. This new policy means more pregnant women will spend time in detention.“This new ICE policy memo confirms our fears that the government is continuing its barbaric policy of detaining pregnant women despite substantial evidence that detention of this particularly vulnerable population has been linked to serious health implications to the mother and unborn child and also constitutes a significant barrier to receiving a meaningful day in court,” said Katie Shepherd, who does legal advocacy for asylum-seeking women at the American Immigration Council.'},
 {'title': 'Spooked Republicans Scramble to Tie Trump’s Hands on China Trade Talks',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When President Donald Trump tweeted earlier this month about his apparent desire to help a Chinese telecommunications firm that skirted U.S. sanctions, Republicans on Capitol Hill largely brushed it off, confident that the president’s advisers would set him straight.But when it became clear this week that his top negotiators for trade talks with China were prepared to go that route, congressional Republicans scrambled. Within hours, they had joined Democrats not only in writing letters to Trump and his cabinet officials—but also supporting, en masse, a legislative vehicle that wrests power away from the executive branch.GOP lawmakers have grown visibly frustrated with the Trump administration amid high-stakes trade talks with Beijing—and they’re openly fearing that the negotiators will, against the advice of top intelligence officials, provide relief to China-based ZTE in order to reduce the trade deficit between the two countries.“There’s just concerns about mixing national security with other things that don’t have to do with it,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in an interview. “Then there’s the concerns about how the whole trade thing is being handled, period.”Democrats and Republicans were alarmed when Trump tweeted earlier this month about his desire to save Chinese jobs by giving ZTE—the Chinese telecommunications giant that has evaded U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran, and which intelligence officials say poses national security risks to the U.S.—“a way to get back into business, fast.”Republicans, while concerned with the president’s tweets, initially did not appear to put much stock in them. But as soon as they realized Trump might have been serious, senators took swift legislative action. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the administration had agreed in principle to lift a U.S. Commerce Department ban that prevents ZTE from buying American parts—in exchange for paying a fine that, according to Trump, would exceed $1 billion. In a separate tweet this week, Trump said China would “purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.”The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, by a vote of 23 to 2, approved Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-MD) amendment aimed at blocking the administration from unilaterally lifting existing penalties against ZTE without first certifying that the company is in compliance with U.S. laws. The existing ban has crippled ZTE, which relies heavily on American parts for its phones. American intelligence officials have warned that ZTE’s technology could be used to conduct cyber-espionage in the U.S.In response to the reported deal between Washington and Beijing, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) vowed “veto-proof congressional action” and accused the administration of “surrendering” to China.“Those in the administration pushing for deal with #ZTE have access to same classified info we do about the national security danger posed by #ZTE & #China telecomm,” wrote Rubio, who spoke on the Senate floor for 25 minutes about the issue on Wednesday. “I don’t understand how they can push for a deal that lets them keep operating in U.S.”Van Hollen, who authored the legislative push, told The Daily Beast that such a deal between the two countries “would send a terrible signal to anybody else who is currently violating U.S. sanctions or thinking about violating it, that if they catch you, you’ve just got to call up President Trump and he’ll give you a way out. That’ll unravel the entire sanctions regime.”GOP lawmakers characterized the banking committee’s action as a pre-emptive measure to ensure that the president and his top negotiators would not compromise U.S. national security simply to win concessions from China on trade issues. The vote came just hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration would not agree to a “quid pro quo” on ZTE and suggested that ZTE would be not used as a bargaining chip for trade talks. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) described the entire ordeal as “confusing.”“I think we’re going to have to continue that conversation and make clear that from a ZTE standpoint it’s primarily a national security concern, and make sure that that’s appropriately addressed—because I’m not sure it is yet.”— Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn“I think we’re going to have to continue that conversation and make clear that from a ZTE standpoint it’s primarily a national security concern, and make sure that that’s appropriately addressed—because I’m not sure it is yet,” Cornyn said in an interview.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Joaquin Castro (D-TX)—wrote a similar letter to the president.The efforts were precipitated in part by lawmakers’ frustrations that they were being left in the dark on a high-stakes issue over which Congress has historically exercised broad authority.“I think people just don’t know. I think people just want to understand—there’s been nothing said about what was on their mind when they decided to lift the sanctions,” a frustrated Corker told The Daily Beast. “It’s more of that, just what’s behind this and are we taking a national security interest and throwing it under the bus to deal with an issue that’s unrelated? People just want an understanding.”Lawmakers are seeking to create a process whereby they can substantively push back against the Trump administration if negotiators agree to lift U.S. penalties against ZTE as part of a trade deal with China. Tuesday’s vote in the banking committee was the first step toward establishing that process, senators said.“Congress ought to always utilize its powers particularly when it comes to trade, which are provided to us by the Constitution. We ought to be paying attention to what’s going on here,” Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), a member of the banking committee, told The Daily Beast. He said Congress has yet to gain an “understanding of what the administration’s strategy is.”When Trump first announced in March that he was instituting a broad tariff policy targeting steel and aluminum imports, conservatives and Republicans on Capitol Hill lined up in opposition. They even warned that the risks of a trade war with other countries could cost American jobs and undermine the GOP’s efforts to highlight a strong economy in the run-up to the midterm elections. But they declined to respond legislatively, and instead vowed to work with the Trump administration to narrow the tariff policy.But this time appears different.“Republicans and Democrats alike think it’s outrageous that the president cut a deal with a Chinese company that flouts international laws and lies to the United States,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), the top Democrat on the banking committee, said in an interview.Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who has also been outspoken on the issue, told The Daily Beast that senators began viewing it as a real possibility this week that the administration would give in to China on ZTE.“We hope they don’t go that far,” Rounds said. “We just want to let them know how serious we think it is.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Administration’s ‘Nerve Center’ for Sanctions Policy Is ‘Depleted’ at the Worst Possible Time',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The little-known federal agency in charge of enforcing financial punishments against the United States’ geopolitical foes is busy these days. But it’s also starving for cash and staff, and its director left the government last week.The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is formally tasked with enforcing American sanctions that target countries like Russia, North Korea and Iran—all of which have been hit with tough economic penalties in recent months and years.But according to more than a dozen congressional aides, attorneys and former employees, OFAC is operating shorthanded at a critical juncture. One former OFAC employee described the agency as “depleted.” Another punch to the gut came on Friday when John Smith, who served as director for the past three years, left the agency.Recently, the division that oversees OFAC received a funding boost. A Treasury Department spokesman confirmed to The Daily Beast that the Terrorism and Financial Intelligence unit received a $25 million increase in its 2018 budget, and an additional $17 million increase for 2019 is pending.But while the additional money was welcomed, not everyone is sure it will be sufficient in helping the agency tackle the immense responsibilities it is now being handed. The Trump administration is trying to squeeze North Korea as part of its “maximum pressure” campaign to get Kim Jong Un to negotiate over his country’s nuclear program. It is also reportedly set to reject a waiver of sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program. And on top of that, Congress continues to pressure the administration to swiftly and aggressively implement mandatory sanctions against Russia that were passed and signed into law last year. “This is a small agency with an enormous and politically significant mission that is surprisingly underfunded given how important its work is, and given how readily U.S. policymakers reach for sanctions as a tool for foreign policy,” said Liz Rosenberg, a former senior adviser to the Treasury official responsible for economic sanctions across the entire U.S. government. “The last three administrations have all focused on sanctions as a national security tool, but this one has really doubled down.”Crafting a sanctions regime is a delicate and complex inter-agency process that involves the State Department and the intelligence community along with officials at Treasury and the White House. OFAC is routinely referred to as the “nerve center” of that operation.It’s also, in the words of another former staffer, the agency with the most significant “capacity challenges.” An individual with direct knowledge of the Treasury Department’s sanctions enforcement process noted that OFAC reports often include transliterated phrases because very few employees speak languages such as Russian or Chinese, which are necessary for Russian and North Korean sanctions designations. Often, the prospective employees who speak those languages have spent time overseas and therefore have more foreign contacts, which makes it more difficult to get the proper security clearance required to work at OFAC.Adam M. Smith, a sanctions attorney at Gibson Dunn and a former senior adviser to the OFAC director, described the agency as “the little engine that could,” noting that OFAC employees do an “admirable job in meeting ever-increasing demands placed on them by this administration.” But OFAC, which has more than 200 employees, none of which are political appointees, has historically been under-funded and over-exerted.Lawmakers have long expressed concern about this, according to a congressional aide who has been directly involved in U.S. sanctions policy for several years. And as events warrant, personnel are often shifted from one portfolio to another on short notice. At a particular moment, half of the agency’s employees could be working on Iran-related sanctions, leaving other critical sanctions regimes—like North Korea and Russia—severely understaffed. This seems likely to become the case if President Donald Trump, as the Washington Post reported Monday night, decides to facilitate the process whereby sanctions could be re-imposed on Iranian oil exports, a move that could facilitate a tit-for-tat involving even deeper economic sanctions.The Treasury Department only recently asked for more resources, after several years of requesting modest, if any, spending increases. The Terrorism and Financial Intelligence division asked for $139 million for its fiscal-year 2019 budget—an increase of nearly $37 million from last year. That value included a request for 69 new full-time staffers across the entire division.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Of the total increase requested, $15.2 million is designated for North Korea sanctions alone. That’s because even with the development of a new sanctions regime targeting Iran likely fast approaching, and Russia remaining on OFAC’s radar, North Korea is the most pressing diplomatic challenge for the administration. The White House has argued that Kim’s apparent willingness to negotiate over his nuclear program can be attributed directly to the administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which has relied heavily on economic sanctions enforced by OFAC. But aides and experts are worried that the agency may lack the resources to oversee the administration’s ambitious plans right now. “There’s a real challenge of having enough focus and dedication and resourcing to the North Korean sanctions in general,” the congressional aide said, adding that lawmakers have for years asked Treasury to send them funding requests.Lawyers who challenge OFAC’s enforcement are starting to notice the patchwork. Erich Ferrari, a prominent sanctions attorney in Washington who deals with OFAC frequently, told The Daily Beast that only three employees have been “active and engaged” on a recent North Korea enforcement action that his firm has been involved with.“There’s not enough people to do the job, or to fulfill the mandate of OFAC to begin with,” Ferrari said, noting that the agency rarely has the staffing resources to deal properly with litigation and other challenges to sanctions designations."},

Its president, Rim Albezem, also released a statement about Ballard’s decision to end its representation of ASM. “In the short time we have worked together, the performance of the Ballard Partners firm on behalf of our organization has been exemplary and has surpassed my very high expectations,” she said. “I am more than fully confident in the firm’s efforts to help secure America’s safety and security through promotion of free and fully democratic elections in Syria. Furthermore, I am very pleased that they will continue to fight on behalf of our organization's sacrosanct mission, and have terminated their representation with ASM in order to eliminate any distraction from our shared goals for both America and Syria.”"},

Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said.GOP lawmakers have uniformly criticized the White House’s response to communications aide Kelly Sadler’s reported comments in which she dismissed McCain’s opposition to CIA Director-designate Gina Haspel, saying the longtime senator is “dying anyway.” McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer last year and has been receiving treatment in Arizona for the past five months.The White House has said the matter was dealt with “internally.” Sadler called Meghan McCain, the senator’s daughter, to apologize. But Sadler has not yet done so publicly.Republican senators told The Daily Beast that the weekly lunch—which typically focuses on policy issues and, more recently, the GOP’s strategy for the midterm elections—would not be the appropriate venue to raise their concerns about Sadler’s remarks.“That’s not what we do in these meetings. No one would have ever brought up something like that,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who characterized the president’s lengthy remarks as “a summary of all that’s happening around the world and here.”A handful of Republican senators also raised concerns this week after the president, in a tweet, pledged to work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to save ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications firm that has evaded U.S. sanctions. U.S. intelligence chiefs have warned that the company’s products could pose national security risks.The Daily Beast spoke with a dozen Republican senators who were in the room for the duration of the mid-day meeting on Capitol Hill with the president, who spoke at length about his accomplishments and other policy issues, with a heavy focus on trade and foreign policy pressure-points including North Korea, China and Iran.“The president was guarded but optimistic,” Sen.

 {'title': 'This Grassroots Group Could Expand Medicaid in Deep-Red Idaho',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Reclaim Idaho, a group of volunteers that criss-crossed the state in a green camper van for months, has gathered enough signatures to get Medicaid expansion on the state ballot in November. In the process, they grassroots organization has potentially set up a showdown with Republican state lawmakers to enact the initiative into law. The state requires 56,192 valid signatures, along with signatures from six percent of registered voters in 18 legislative districts, both of which the group said they had accomplished on Monday. They won’t know the final fate of their efforts until this summer as county clerks in the state need to validate the signatures by June 30 and, from there, petitions will be submitted to the secretary of state’s office by July 6. Emily Strizich, co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, told The Daily Beast that they estimated that they had some 90,000 signatures total and that the group has talked to some 120,000 people around the state about Medicaid expansion.At least one Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state, Rep. Raul Labrador, has opened the door to possibly overturning the initiative should he be elected and should it pass. Strizich said her organization is prepared for such a possibility.“We do anticipate that there will be some opposition to this moving forward in the persuasion campaign,” Strizich said. “But what we have seen as we’ve been getting signatures is when you educate voters as to the issue, as to the financial repercussions and the positive impact that would have on Idaho's economy to expand the Medicaid program, set aside even the moral implications of providing people care when they need it, I think it’s a really popular idea.”Strizich said that if the initiative made it to the November ballot, a simple majority of voters could pass it, helping to provide coverage for some 62,000 uninsured Idahoans. A similar battle over Medicaid is playing out in more dramatic terms in Maine, where Republican Gov. Paul LePage has refused to expand Medicaid in the state despite 59 percent of voters voting in favor of doing so. On Monday, he was sued by supporters of the expansion to force his hand into doing so. Asked about Labrador’s signaled interest in overturning a potentially passed measure, Strizich said “Could you imagine somebody going into a job interview and just telling the person interviewing them ‘I’m probably not going to do what you ask me.’ You got to give Labrador credit for being transparent.”Reclaim Idaho’s first kickoff event to gather signatures, Strizich said, was just last December 19.

 {'title': 'EXCLUSIVE: ‘Lone DNC Hacker’ Guccifer 2.0 Slipped Up and Revealed He Was a Russian Intelligence Officer',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Guccifer 2.0, the “lone hacker” who took credit for providing WikiLeaks with stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, was in fact an officer of Russia’s military intelligence directorate (GRU), The Daily Beast has learned. It’s an attribution that resulted from a fleeting but critical slip-up in GRU tradecraft. That forensic determination has substantial implications for the criminal probe into potential collusion between President Donald Trump and Russia. The Daily Beast has learned that the special counsel in that investigation, Robert Mueller, has taken over the probe into Guccifer and brought the FBI agents who worked to track the persona onto his team. While it’s unclear what Mueller plans to do with Guccifer, his last round of indictments charged 13 Russians tied to the Internet Research Agency troll farm with a conspiracy “for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016.” It was Mueller’s first move establishing Russian interference in the election within a criminal context, but it stopped short of directly implicating the Putin regime. Mueller’s office declined to comment for this story. But the attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest foreign intelligence agency would cross the Kremlin threshold—and move the investigation closer to Trump himself.“The attribution of Guccifer 2.0 as an officer of Russia’s largest foreign intelligence agency brings the investigation closer to the Kremlin’s doorstep—and to Trump himself.”Trump’s longtime political adviser Roger Stone admitted being in touch with Guccifer over Twitter’s direct messaging service. And in August 2016, Stone published an article on the pro-Trump-friendly Breitbart News calling on his political opponents to “Stop Blaming Russia” for the hack. “I have some news for Hillary and Democrats—I think I’ve got the real culprit,” he wrote. “It doesn’t seem to be the Russians that hacked the DNC, but instead a hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer 2.0.”Five months later, in January 2017, the CIA, NSA, and FBI assessed “with high confidence” that “Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data.” But the assessment did not directly call Guccifer a Russian intelligence officer. Nor did it provide any evidence for its assertions. It turns out there is a powerful reason to connect Guccifer to the GRU. Guccifer 2.0 sprang into existence on June 15, 2016, hours after a report by a computer security firm forensically tied Russia to an intrusion at the Democratic National Committee. In a series of blog posts and tweets over the following seven months—conspicuously ending right as Trump took office and not resuming—the Guccifer persona published a smattering of the DNC documents while gamely projecting an image as an independent Romanian hacktivist who’d breached the DNC on a lark. As Stone’s Breitbart piece demonstrated, Guccifer provided Moscow with a counter-narrative for the election interference.Guccifer famously pretended to be a “lone hacker” who perpetrated the digital DNC break-in. From the outset, few believed it. Motherboard conducted a devastating interview with Guccifer that exploded the account’s claims of being a native Romanian speaker. Based on forensic clues in some of Guccifer’s leaks, and other evidence, a consensus quickly formed among security experts that Guccifer was completely notional. “Almost immediately various cyber security companies and individuals were skeptical of Guccifer 2.0 and the backstory that he had generated for himself,” said Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at the cyber security firm ThreatConnect. “We started seeing these inconsistencies that led back to the idea that he was created hastily… by the individual or individuals that affected the DNC compromise.”Proving that link definitively was harder. Ehmke worked on an investigation at ThreatConnect that tried to track down Guccifer from the metadata in his emails. But the trail always ended at the same data center in France. Ehmke eventually uncovered that Guccifer was connecting through an anonymizing service called Elite VPN, a virtual private networking service that had an exit point in France but was headquartered in Russia.“Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow.”But on one occasion, The Daily Beast has learned, Guccifer failed to activate the VPN client before logging on. As a result, he left a real, Moscow-based Internet Protocol address in the server logs of an American social media company, according to a source familiar with the government’s Guccifer investigation. Twitter and WordPress were Guccifer 2.0’s favored outlets. Neither company would comment for this story, and Guccifer did not respond to a direct message on Twitter.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Working off the IP address, U.S. investigators identified Guccifer 2.0 as a particular GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow. (The Daily Beast’s sources did not disclose which particular officer worked as Guccifer.)Security firms and declassified U.S. intelligence findings previously identified the GRU as the agency running “Fancy Bear,” the ten-year-old hacking organization behind the DNC email theft, as well as breaches at NATO, Obama’s White House, a French television station, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and countless NGOs, and militaries and civilian agencies in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.Timestamps in Guccifer 2.0’s first leaks show they were packaged for release over the course of a single day in June 2016, beginning just hours after the DNC intrusion and its attribution to Russia were made public. The moniker was an homage to Romanian hacker Marcel Lazăr Lehel, who as “Guccifer” achieved notoriety in 2013 for a string of hacks against celebrities and politicians.In his inaugural blog post, Guccifer 2.0 disputed Russia’s involvement and claimed credit personally for the DNC breach, positioning himself as a one-time hacking operation working to expose “the Illuminati.” The post included the world’s first glimpse of the enormous cache of documents siphoned from the DNC’s network, including the Democrats’ opposition research report on Trump. Presaging the leaks that would roil the election, Guccifer 2.0 declared that he’d already sent the bulk of the stolen material to WikiLeaks—which has spent the time since obfuscating whether Guccifer was its source. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks began releasing its cache of approximately 19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments stolen in the hack. While Trump promoted the leak on Twitter and in rallies, his surrogate Roger Stone pushed back against the Kremlin attribution. In his August 2016 article for Breitbart, he argued that Guccifer 2.0 was the Romanian hacktivist he claimed to be. “Guccifer 2.0 is the real deal,” he wrote.Last May, Stone admitted that he’d also exchanged direct messages with the Guccifer 2.0 persona, and he released what he claimed was a complete transcript of his communications with the account. The transcript is brief and banal, showing Stone congratulating Guccifer 2.0 on returning to Twitter after a brief suspension, and then mostly ignoring him. Then and since, Stone has consistently denied that Guccifer was connected to the Kremlin. “I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State, Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as intermediaries for them,” he wrote.“I myself had no contacts or communications with the Russian State, Russian Intelligence or anyone fronting for them or acting as intermediaries for them.”— Roger StoneGuccifer 2.0 maintained a sporadic online presence throughout the election, posting to his dedicated WordPress blog and on Twitter, and spilling more DNC documents, sometimes in private emails to journalists. While the national election clearly interested him (“Democrats prepare new provocation against Trump,” he thundered in October 2016), Guccifer 2.0 reached down the ballot as well, posting documents from the Democrats’ national campaign committee on his WordPress blog. There, readers could find internal Democratic candidate assessments relevant to battleground states like Pennsylvania and Florida; internal assessments of key congressional districts, with granular analyses of their demographics; and campaign recruitment material. The GRU officer was eager to share this trove, as well. A GOP political operative in Florida, Aaron Nevins, DM’d Guccifer 2.0 a request for “any Florida based information” and received 2.5 gigabytes’ worth, according to The Wall Street Journal. The data, he enthused to Guccifer 2.0, was “probably worth millions of dollars.” A consultant for a successful Florida Republican congressional candidate told the paper, “I did adjust some voting targets based on some data I saw from the leaks.”Sometime after its hasty launch, the Guccifer persona was handed off to a more experienced GRU officer, according to a source familiar with the matter. The timing of that handoff is unclear, but Guccifer 2.0’s last blog post, from Jan. 12, 2017, evinced a far greater command of English than the persona’s earlier efforts. “It’s obvious that the intelligence agencies are deliberately falsifying evidence,” the post read. “In my opinion, they’re playing into the hands of the Democrats who are trying to blame foreign actors for their failure.”(Contrast that with the language from\xa0a June 2016 post: “I made some conclusions from the Marcel’s story and decided not to put all eggs in one basket. Moreover, other cases weren’t so successful and didn’t bring me the glory.”)Today the most popular counter-narrative surrounding Guccifer 2.0 concedes that the account was a fake persona but posits that it was created by the DNC to support a false-flag operation implicating Russia. In this theory, advanced in two widely cited anonymous blogs, Guccifer 2.0 was the DNC posing as Russia posing as a Romanian hacker."},

  'body': "Adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, better known as her stage name Stormy Daniels, on Sunday revealed the details of an alleged affair with President Donald Trump, telling Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes that she felt threatened into remaining silent about the alleged affair and later was pressured to deny it.During the sit-down, which aired in prime time across the U.S., Daniels said she feared for her and her family’s safety, and opted to sign a nondisclosure agreement instead of going public and cashing in for more money.“I think the fact that I didn’t even negotiate, I just quickly said yes to this very, you know, strict contract,” Daniels said. “And what most people will agree with me extremely low number. It’s all the proof I need.”Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime personal attorney, has acknowledged making a $130,000 payment to Daniels in October 2016, just days before the presidential election. Daniels has said the payment was made as part of the nondisclosure agreement in order to buy her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. She says their tryst took place in July 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, not long after Melania Trump had given birth to their son, Barron.According to Daniels, Trump said during their initial encounter in his hotel room that she reminded him of his daughter Ivanka. Former Playboy model Karen McDougal—who alleges a 10-month affair with Trump that also included that same weekend in Tahoe—said in an interview last week that Trump made a similar comment to her.Daniels said the pair became more comfortable with each other after she instructed Trump to pull down his pants so that she could spank him with a magazine, which featured his face on the cover.“So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little—you know had underwear on and stuff and I just gave him a couple swats,” Daniels said.Later, Daniels said, she used the bathroom in the hotel room. When she returned, Trump was sitting on the edge of the bed.“I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone's room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, ‘Well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this,’” she said.According to Daniels, she and Trump had unprotected sex. She said that even though she did not want to have sex with him and was not physically attracted to him, it was entirely consensual.“That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.”After their first encounter, Daniels says, Trump invited her to different events and kept dangling the possibility of signing her as a contestant on The Apprentice. Daniels said she viewed it as a potential “business deal.” She met with him a year later in Beverly Hills where the pair watched Shark Week together for four hours and did not have sex. Trump said he would have an answer for her the following week about appearing on The Apprentice. Daniels ended up not getting a spot on the show.Four years later, Daniels says she was physically threatened after Cohen found out that she had tried to tell her story to a celebrity gossip magazine. Daniels said she was in a parking lot with her infant daughter when a man approached her and said, “That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.” The man referenced the magazine story, saying: “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Trump himself has yet to speak publicly about it, and the White House has dodged reporters’ questions on the matter. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Trump and Cohen dined together on Saturday at the president’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.After The Wall Street Journal first reported on the existence of the payment, Daniels said she felt pressured by her attorney and business manager at the time to sign documents denying an affair with Trump. Those documents were released publicly.“They made it sound like I had no choice,” she said. “I felt intimidated and honestly bullied. And I didn’t know what to do. And so I signed it.”Daniels said she was compelled to come forward about the alleged affair in part because of the efforts to discredit her.“I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I’m not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, ‘Oh, you’re an opportunist. You’re taking advantage of this,’” Daniels said. “Yes, I’m getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they’ve been making, doing the same thing that they’ve always done?”Daniels filed a lawsuit earlier this month alleging that the nondisclosure agreement is invalid because Trump never signed the contract. Even before the 60 Minutes interview aired, the lawyers involved in enforcing the agreement were seeking $20 million from Daniels in alleged violations. Those lawyers reportedly considered seeking an injunction to prevent the interview from airing.In the run-up to the sit-down, Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, tweeted a photo of a disc inside a safe, apparently suggesting that photo or video evidence of the alleged affair exists. Avenatti, who also appeared in the 60 Minutes segment, declined to discuss whether such evidence exists. Avenatti previously said the interview would not cover all of the evidence because “that would be foolish.”"},

  'body': 'Illinois voters went to the polls Tuesday for the state’s primary contests, picking, respectively, a billionaire Democrat, a former mayoral candidate and, quite possibly, a conservative Democratic incumbent. The first race of the night to be called was the gubernatorial Democratic primary. Billionaire J.B. Pritzker won his primary contest with over 45 percent of the vote after spending close to $70 million on the unbelievably expensive contest. Pritzker beat out Daniel Biss, a progressive state senator endorsed by the political organization Our Revolution, and Chris Kennedy, the son of Robert F. Kennedy. According to an investigation from the Chicago Tribune, Pritzker—who’s released just two pages of his personal income-tax returns—set up a host of offshore shell companies between 2008 and 2011 along with his brother Anthony. On the Republican side, Gov. Bruce Rauner narrowly avoided an upset against his opponent State Representative Jeanne Ives. The night’s marquee race in Illinois’ Third Congressional District had incumbent Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski, an abortion opponent who voted against the Affordable Care Act and the DREAM Act, held on to narrowly defeat progressive challenger Marie Newman, 51 percent to 49 percent. A member of the Lipinski family has represented the district for 35 years, and Dan Lipinski was first elected in 2004 after his father dropped out of that year’s contest. Newman, his first serious challenger, was endorsemed by EMILY’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Illinois Democrats Rep. Jan Schakowsky and Luis Gutierrez. The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List recently made a big final push for Lipinski, with a reported 70 canvassers and a significant ad and mail campaign on his behalf. Lipinski will face off in the deeply blue district against Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier who ran unopposed and was disavowed by the Illinois Republican Party. In Illinois’ Fourth Congressional District, Jesus “Chuy” Garcia won his Democratic primary for a safe seat represented by Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill), who is retiring after this term in Congress. Sen. Sanders recently campaigned on behalf of Garcia, a former mayoral candidate in Chicago who serves on the Cook County Board of Commissioners. '},

John Sarbanes (D-MD), the chair of the congressional Democracy Reform Task Force, thinks he’s found a way to thread the needle. “I mean you can basically say ‘Look, nobody should be interfering with our democracy, with our elections,” Sarbanes said in an interview with The Daily Beast on Monday. “So foreigners shouldn’t be doing it, special interests shouldn’t be doing it, big money shouldn’t be doing it. It belongs to you, the people. It’s your campaign, it’s your politics, it’s your government.” Sarbanes, along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), unveiled a broad anti-corruption platform on Monday meant to serve as a supplement to the Democrats’ economic messaging in the “Better Deal” platform. Riffing on President Trump’s own successful slogan “drain the swamp,” the platform is intended to fix the campaign finance system, strengthen ethics laws and facilitate better access to the ballot box for every American voter. It harkens back to a successful messaging platform of 2006, a year in which Democrats won majorities in both the House and Senate. Putting this out now, six months ahead of 2018’s midterm elections, accomplishes two things in Sarbanes’ eyes. It provides an additional incentive for voters to consider a changing of the guard in the nation’s capital and holds members accountable at the same time. Should Democrats win a majority in November, in part because of this messaging, it will be incumbent upon them to pass legislation in the first 100 days that accomplishes these goals. “This reform message is not something you just wear for the evening, this is something you own,” Sarbanes said. And it’s broad enough in scope, Democrats hope, that it provides an anecdote to the drumbeat of stories about corruption, from foreign and domestic sources. “Every new story is a story about how somebody else is manipulating the government that should belong to the people,” Sarbanes told The Daily Beast. Voters, he said “don’t have to parse through the latest story on why they’re being disrespected or exploited or taken advantage of. Because they can seek refuge in something that’s positive and affirmative that restores their place in their own democracy.”'},

  'body': "In the Democratic primary in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, former fighter pilot Amy McGrath defeated Lexington Mayor Jim Gray while running up strong numbers in the district’s rural areas. Gray, initially cajoled into the contest by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, conceded the race around 8 pm on Tuesday night. . Initially, Gray’s entry into the primary contest drew the ire of McGrath and her campaign. They viewed it as a slight for a candidate who had already created a viral ad and began raising serious money. And according to McGrath’s own campaign, he held at least a 40-point lead against her when he entered the race. The DCCC did not add either of the candidates to its coveted “Red to Blue” which provides additional resources for Democrats seeking to flip Republican-held seats. And one aide on the committee informed The Daily Beast that they viewed either candidate as being in a strong position to take on incumbent Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY).When the race was over, DCCC chairman Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) said “Amy has built a formidable campaign, and voters across the district have responded to her message of leadership and standing up for affordable health care. With her inspiring record of service and all of the momentum at her back, there is no question that Amy McGrath is ready to flip this key district.”Gray, for his part, acknowledged in an interview with The Daily Beast last week that this was going to be a difficult race. “Nobody is entitled to this nomination,” he said. “We have to earn it.”His campaign’s last minute decision to air an ad McGrath viewed as negative on Friday evening may not have helped his case either. It used her service in the Marine Corps to paint McGrath as somewhat of a carpetbagger and drew a condemnation from the campaign. McGrath outraised Gray throughout the primary cycle and earned the support of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA). His group raised over $130,000 for her and sent out over 44,000 get-out-the-vote texts on her behalf just this weekend, according to a source directly familiar. \xa0“I think Amy is a fantastic leader and that’s what makes her a great candidate,” Moulton said in an interview on Tuesday night. “She’s someone who has the courage to stand up to the political establishment.”Voters also went to the polls in Georgia, Texas and Arkansas on Tuesday night to select congressional and gubernatorial candidates. In one of the nation’s most watched contests, Stacey Abrams, a former state house leader, easily won Georgia’s Democratic gubernatorial primary. Abrams made history as the first African-American woman selected by a major party to be a gubernatorial nominee. Earning the support of a wide swath of national Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA), Abrams has promised to a run a campaign focused on animating the state’s progressives.“Team Abrams just won our primary election, and this victory belongs to you,” she said in a Facebook post. “Everyone who believed that a little Black girl who sometimes had to go without lights or running water – who grew up to become the first woman to lead in the Georgia General Assembly – could become the first woman gubernatorial nominee from either party in Georgia's history.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In 2016, President Trump only won Georgia by less than six points. “This historic victory is a model for candidates all across the country for how to engage and excite black voters - her campaign prioritized grassroots community outreach and engagement in communities of color, talking to tens of thousands of voters about the issues at stake,” Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, an instrumental group in recent Democratic victories in Virginia and Alabama, said in a statement. “Stacey’s success underscores the importance of investing in early and sustained outreach to Black voters as well as the critical role that grassroots community organizations, who do this work every single day of the year, play in key elections.”Democrats were also paying close attention to Texas, where there were three runoffs between candidates in districts the party is hoping to flip in November in districts with Republican incumbents but that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. In the state’s 23rd Congressional District, former Air Force intelligence officer Gina Ortiz Jones won her race against Rick Treviño. Added to the DCCC’s Red to Blue program, Jones will face off against Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX) in November, who has been a prime target for Democrats after narrowly winning his last two elections. In Texas’ 32nd Congressional District, Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and former NFL player advanced against Lillian Salerno, a former Obama administration appointee. Allred, also backed by the DCCC will face incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX). Finally, in Texas’ 7th Congressional District, Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a Houston attorney was poised to easily defeat Laura Moser, a progressive activist and former journalist. Fletcher will face Rep. John Culberson (R-TX), allowing national Democrats to breathe a sigh of relief. They had perceived Moser as a liability in the race and released opposition research on her in an effort to derail her campaign. In ended up helping her raise money and advance to the runoff but Moser was not able to defeat Fletcher on Tuesday night. "},

I love y’all.”The Texas Republican, hosted a talk-radio show prior to his 2010 election to represent the state’s 27th district, announced in December that he would not seek reelection in 2018—a decision supported by Republican leadership. In 2014, he settled a sexual-harassment claim with his former communications director Lauren Greene and had been accused of cultivating a hostile working environment by other colleagues. In settling that claim, Farenthold shelled out $84,000 in taxpayer money. Greene contended that the congressman told another aide in their office that he had “wet dreams” about her. She went on to say that when she protested some of the remarks Farenthold had made about her, she was fired. The suit was dropped when they reached the settlement. Another woman, who served as Farenthold’s press secretary, told The New York Times that the lawmaker drank often and bullied staffers. “Because of his tendency to flirt, the staffers who accompanied him to Capitol Hill functions would joke that they had to be on ‘redhead patrol’ to keep him out of trouble,” Greene said in her complaint. Farenthold, the previous owner of domain name blow-me.org, walked back a promise earlier this year to back the money he used for the settlement. As of his resignation, he still has not reimbursed the public funds.The National Republican Congressional Committee hasn’t forgotten.“I hope Blake is true to his word and pays back the $84,000 of taxpayer money he used as a settlement,” NRCC chairman Steve Stivers said in a statement. “As I have said repeatedly, Congress must hold ourselves to a higher standard and regain the trust of the American people.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'McCain: Obama Thanked Me for My Vote to Save Obamacare',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Before he cast his dramatic vote in the wee hours of the morning to kill his party’s best Obamacare repeal effort, Sen. John McCain took a call from Donald Trump urging him to reconsider. By that point, the Arizona Republican had already made up his mind, and would, as he put it, politely rebuff the president. Moments later, McCain wandered on to the floor and dramatically thrust his thumb down, signaling his no vote. The moment earned McCain plaudits from Democrats along with the ire of Trump. It also got him another phone call. “Among the people who called to thank me was President Obama,” McCain writes in his upcoming book The Restless Wave. The book is due out on May 22, but The Daily Beast obtained an early copy.McCain and Obama had run against each other for the presidency in 2008. But over time, they had re-established a solid working relationship. Both share a healthy skepticism of the current president, a point the senator appeared to underscore later in the book. “I appreciated his call, but, as I said, my purpose hadn’t been to preserve his signature accomplishment but to insist on a better alternative, and to give the Senate an opportunity to work together to find one,” the Arizona Republican writes. “He hadn’t called to lobby me before the vote, which I had appreciated. He had last called me not long after the November election, during the transition to the Trump administration, to congratulate me on my re-election. He added that he was counting on me to be an outspoken and independent voice for the causes I believed in as I had been during his presidency. I thanked him, and said I would try to be.” The book describes the late-night vote in dramatic fashion, with McCain not willing to tip off reporters but first telling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) that he intended to vote no.Vice President Mike Pence also tried to lobby McCain on the floor but to no avail, eventually opting to put Trump on the phone to make that final attempt. “I listened quietly as he asked me to reconsider,” McCain writes. The remainder of the book, co-written with former adviser Mark Salter, is a broader reflection on McCain’s life and some of his regrets, including criticisms of Trump and an appraisal of the current state of American politics.

 {'title': 'No One Knows Who’s Spending Millions on the West Virginia Senate Race',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'One super PAC with links to national Democrats has spent more than $1.3 million primarily targeting a single Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate race. Another, with links to national Republicans, has spent more than $1.5 million targeting a different Republican candidate. The money represents a substantial investment in a primary in a small state. But what’s even more remarkable is that the groups have done it all without disclosing a single name of a donor funding their efforts. It’s totally legal. The PACs have elected to adjust their filing frequency with the Federal Election Commission so as to shield who is funding their respective PACs until the primary ends. But it still underscores the gamesmanship that has erupted as the contest enters its final week, with the real possibility that Don Blankenship, the previously jailed coal executive, could end up the Republican nominee against incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin. The Duty and Country PAC, which shares a Washington D.C. address with the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, has spent in excess of $1.35 million. Much of it has been directed at Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-WV), who has polled as a frontrunner in the GOP race. Some of it has gone against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. None has been spent against Blankenship, leading observers to speculate that there is an inherent effort to lift him up so as to give Manchin an easier general election opponent. Those directly involved in the spending strategy deny that they’re mischievously meddling.“Our data from the beginning has shown that Morrisey or Jenkins will be the likely nominee,” Mike Plante, a spokesman for the PAC told The Daily Beast. “That’s why in making the calculations that we’ve done, we’ve adopted the strategy that we’ve adopted.”A separate outside group, the Senate Majority PAC, has spent over $1.6 million so far, primarily on positive spots for Manchin. But there is plenty of precedent for outside Democratic groups to secretly get involved, sometimes trying to bolster weaker Republican candidates in GOP primaries, with to some success. The group Highway 31, funded primarily by Senate Majority PAC, spent millions in Alabama for Democratic candidate Doug Jones and against Republican candidate Judge Roy Moore, all while being shrouded in mystery during the campaign. And Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) famously spent $1.7 million to boost Republican candidate Todd Akin, only to end up beating him in their general election. \xa0One way to potentially divine Duty and Country’s motives in the race would be to get a better look at who is funding its efforts. But the PAC has only reported receipts of $150 (a total that doesn’t even require disclosure of who gave it) and there won’t be more details forthcoming until after the primary race concludes on Tuesday. One of the few names associated with the PAC that is publicly known is that of its treasurer. Booth Goodwin, is a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Blankenship at his trial. Goodwin did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast. Blankenship, who served a year in prison after being convicted for a conspiracy to violate mine standards following the death of 29 people in a 2010 disaster, is the sole focus of another big spending PAC in the race. The Mountain Families PAC has spent over $1.5 million on the race, according to ad buying sources. And all of that money is being trained on the coal baron who is seen by Republicans as the weakest potential option to run against Manchin. The PAC lists an Arlington, Virginia PO box as its address. And its treasurer, Ben Ottenhoff, previously formed a committee to fundraise on behalf of Luther Strange, the-preferred candidate of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in last year’s Alabama Senate primary. He has also previously served as an assistant treasurer for the National Republican Congressional Committee.

McConnell and his team have made no secret that Blankenship is not their desired choice, with the Senate Majority Leader recently saying that he hopes voters “nominate somebody who can actually win the general election.”That tension peppered Tuesday night’s GOP primary debate on Fox News. When the candidates were asked whether they would support McConnell as Senate Majority Leader, none of them raised their hands. Blankenship cartoonishly ducked down behind the podium. In his subsequent answer, the disgraced coal baron not only accused McConnell of meddling in the election but defended his prior reference to McConnell’s father in law as a “Chinaperson.”"I don’t see this insinuation by the press that there’s something racist about saying \'Chinaperson,\'" said Blankenship, who brought red hats with the phrase “Ditch Mitch,” to the debate (He was not permitted to wear one). "Some people are Korean persons and some of them are African persons, there’s not any slander there."He also said that McConnell “interferes with elections all over this country,” appearing to reference the money that has gone into this specific race.“I\'m not going to D.C. to get along, so that will be a failure because I don\'t intend to get along,” Blankenship said of having a relationship with McConnell. “I intend to make sure that we make a difference.”'},
 {'title': 'GOP Senators Chicken Out on Defending McCain to Trump’s Face',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "One of the knocks on Donald Trump is that he talks and tweets like a tough guy but in personal situations is conflict averse. We hear this every time he refuses to personally fire someone. The same could be said of Members of the United States Senate. They talk a good game, but when it comes to personally confronting Trump, their knees get weak. Case in point: A couple days ago, Republican Senators were publicly chiding Donald Trump over the administration’s refusal to apologize for leaked remarks about Senator John McCain (as you may recall, White House aide Kelly Sadler said McCain’s opposition to Gina Haspel as \xa0CIA director nominee “doesn’t matter, [because] he’s dying anyway.”)Asked if the White House should apologize for the comment, Marco Rubio said, “I believe so. Certainly the comments were made, and no one’s denied they were made. I find them to be offensive and I think more indicative of what our politics has become, so angry and bitter.” “The smart thing to do would have been five days ago to just nip it in the bud and come out and apologize for it,” said Sen. John Thune. Several other senators are on the record calling for an apology, though many couched it in terms that suggest it is Sadler who should publicly apologize (for what it’s worth, she reportedly did privately phone Meghan McCain to apologize). Instead, the administration tried to make this a story about leaks—not about disparaging a Vietnam P.O.W. who is battling brain cancer. “Why no mention of McCain? “That’s not what we do in these meetings,” said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. “No one would have ever brought up something like that.””Regardless, numerous Senate Republicans were outspoken in their insistence that an apology was due. And this makes sense. McCain is a colleague to all, and a friend to many. He was the Republican standard bearer in 2008. The Senate is notoriously chummy. And McCain is an American hero. But during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, the controversy didn’t come up. That’s right. Not one single Senate Republican took an opportunity to press Trump on Sadler's comments. They just let him speak and praised him. Why no mention of McCain? “That’s not what we do in these meetings,” said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. “No one would have ever brought up something like that.” “He wanted to talk about anything and not take questions. ... He gave us a lesson in filibustering. ... He knew he was going to get some tough questions on McCain and ZTE,” said Senator Jeff Flake. Maybe it was a strategy? “Trump dominated the room, voicing confidence about the midterm elections, updating lawmakers on diplomatic talks with North Korea and even musing about retiring one day to West Virginia,” reported the Hill. Still, you would think that if a senator wanted to ask the question, one could have. In fairness, these meetings usually focus on public policy and political strategy. But as far as I know, there’s no law that would prevent a Republican senator from bringing up something to the president that they have been complaining to the media about for days.

They fear the guy. And it's not just them. It's the Democrat’s too. As the Daily Beast’s Sam Stein joked the other day, “Trump is so politically toxic that every Democrat in a tight Senate race is voting to confirm his most controversial nominees.” He has a point. The aforementioned Gina Haspel, who once ran a secret prison that waterboarded detainees, has won the support of Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), and Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana) to become the next CIA director (McCain opposes her nomination). As New York Magazine put it, “The support from the five Democrats, most of whom are facing tough reelection battles in the fall, means that Haspel will almost certainly be confirmed.”Now, to be fair, most of these candidates are in tough races in states that Trump won big league. But that’s just the point. If Trump were toxic, Democratic senators could get away with opposing such a controversial nominee. Trump, it seems, still has juice. This, of course, could change if the midterms end up disastrous. In the wake of the Republican Revolution, President Bill Clinton found himself declaring that “the president is relevant.” Someday, Trump might find himself in a similar situation. For now, at least, there’s no question that the president is still relevant. All you have to do is look at the senators scurry as they hang their dying colleague out to dry."},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Intel Chief Won’t Pledge ‘Full’ Release of Gina Haspel’s Torture Record',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, committed Wednesday to “fully” explaining the torture record of Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.But Coats wouldn’t commit to a full declassification of all materials detailing Haspel’s role in the so-called enhanced-interrogation practices and the destruction of evidence—something that top senators are demanding ahead of her confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is expected later this month. Without full declassification, human-rights groups suspect the CIA and its allies will present a misleading and self-serving picture of Haspel’s involvement in torture to ensure her confirmation.“We want to declassify as much as possible without jeopardizing what we call sources and methods. Every effort will be made to fully explain exactly what her role was and what it wasn’t,” Coats told The Daily Beast at a gathering of the Defense Writers Group in Washington.Coats argued that Haspel’s record has been mischaracterized, and he pledged full transparency as Haspel gears up for what could be a bruising confirmation battle in the Senate. But he would not commit to making that information public, hinting that some of it could be shared privately with the intelligence committee.“Gina plans to be totally transparent in regards to this issue, and a lot of that has been mischaracterized. And I have looked deeply into this. And she will be making that fully available to the relevant committees,” Coats said. “I think a lot of the narratives in the public have been already released to indicate what is being alleged is simply not true.”Last month, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the architect of its “torture report,” wrote a letter to Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director, asking him to declassify all documents and information relevant to Haspel’s involvement in what she called “one of the darkest chapters in American history.”Haspel’s involvement in torture remains cloaked in official secrecy. Both a CIA inspector general’s report and a broader Senate investigation into post-9/11 torture studiously redact or obscure the names of operatives involved in the brutal program. A memoir by Haspel’s CIA mentor, former Counterterrorism Center and clandestine-service senior official Jose Rodriguez—a figure deeply implicated in torture—refers to someone matching Haspel’s description as “Jane.” But Daily Beast sources, stretching back years, hold Haspel in a position of oversight responsibility for a “black site” secret CIA prison in Thailand, shuttered in December 2002, where two of the earliest detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abdel Rahim Nashiri, were extensively tortured. (ProPublica recently retracted a report holding Haspel physically present for Abu Zubaydah’s torture, but did not retract anything about Nashiri.) Additionally, Haspel was a key figure aiding Rodriguez in the destruction of 92 videotapes depicting the brutal interrogations of both men—an act that inadvertently prompted both a Justice Department inquiry and a Senate investigation that led to its landmark 2014 torture report. Coats was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the torture investigation. He, like all of its Republican members, dissented from its assessment and backed the CIA’s accusations that it was a politicized document.Coats joined the chorus of Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials and allies who have praised Haspel and the president for nominating her, mentioning that it would be a milestone for a woman to lead the CIA.“I think it’s a great choice because I work with her every day. And she’s an exceptionally professional and talented individual,” Coats said Wednesday. “Way beyond that, she, in my opinion, has all the qualities and capabilities that are needed. Great respect from her colleagues in the CIA.”Some lawmakers, including Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Rand Paul (R-KY), have already come out against Haspel’s nomination. They’ve argued that her background and her participation in the CIA’s torture program makes her unqualified to serve as the head of that agency. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), a torture victim himself when he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has said that Haspel, who currently serves as deputy CIA director, needs to fully explain her involvement.'},
 {'title': 'Roseanne Could Be a Turning Point for Conservative Women',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "One of the many reasons people were shocked by Donald Trump's election is that they couldn’t fathom that women would vote against a competent female candidate in favor of a man facing very credible allegations of misogyny and harassment. (For the record, I have written that the lingering allegations against Hillary Clinton’s husband certainly complicated things, but Bill Clinton still wasn’t on the ballot in 2016.) While the most common media narrative became that white women voted for Trump en masse because they were racists, the truth is much more complicated. Thanks to Roseanne Barr’s racist rhetoric, among other high-profile conservative missteps, Republicans are likely to find out just how complicated these women voters are\xa0— and to face a real reckoning at the voting booth.Plenty of my liberal friends were shocked that any woman could cast a vote for Donald Trump, but I wasn’t because I had some conservative friends (and yes they are still my friends) who had done just that. Their reasons came down to the issues that were most important to them, like abortion. For those that consider it murder, they were willing to vote for whichever candidate would nominate justices and push policies to end it – even if that meant holding their nose and closing their eyes in the voting booth. And guess what? For those voters President Trump has delivered, from nominating conservative stalwart Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, to reinstating the global gag rule, which prevents international organizations receiving US Aid from discussing abortion options. (The White House is exploring a domestic gag rule as well.) There were other reasons women voted for him that many of us may not fully understand, but those women didn’t need us to understand because their reasons made sense to them. For some, they were willing to vote for a qualified female candidate — including a Democrat — but not for Hillary Clinton. They didn’t like her, didn’t trust her and never would. And while they surmised it was possible that Donald Trump engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior, they already knew Hillary Clinton’s husband had and that she defended him. So in their eyes that made the 2016 election essentially a wash. You could either vote for the guy that you knew was a jerk but who you actually agreed with on tax policy or immigration policy or vote for the woman you may not agree with, because she’s a woman, but she’s a woman married to another jerk. Trump and Clinton were the two least popular presidential nominees on record. \xa0It’s worth noting that historically, the majority of white female voters tend to vote Republican. But while Hillary Clinton managed to increase her support among white women by a sliver over Barack Obama’s 2012 showing (he won 42 percent, she won 43), she actually fell behind his 2008 numbers, when he won 46 percent. Dismissing white female voters who didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton as “racist” or lacking compassion for other women misses the mark. In fact, Clinton’s husband had the best showing of any Democrat in recent memory with this demographic in 1996, winning 48 percent of white women voters, compared to Sen. Bob Dole’s 43%. (Ross Perot took 8%.)The truth is that white women, like white men, tend to vote for candidates for reasons some other groups are less likely to, plain and simple. Let me put it this way: I’ve never heard a black voter talk about wanting to have a beer with a presidential candidate. I know plenty of voters of color – including in my own family – who don’t consider Hillary Clinton inspiring, or frankly, likable. But they considered the alternative utterly terrifying, so whether they liked her or even trusted her didn’t seem all that relevant. For plenty of white women – particularly those who may be pro-life or agree with other conservative policies the alternative wasn’t ideal but it was an alternative to a candidate they liked less.Hillary Clinton will not be on the ballot this fall, or likely ever again. One of the least liked presidential nominees in history who’s now the president with some of the lowest approval ratings in history, will be the figurehead of the Republican Party. And while some women might have been willing to vote for an alleged sexual harasser in 2016, running against the wife of another alleged harasser, the landscape has changed significantly in 2018. The President’s defense and support of Senate candidate Roy Moore, despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct with a child, is not the kind of move that inspires renewed support among women voters – which is how Moore managed to lose to a Democrat in a deep Southern state. (Even the president’s daughter issued a noteworthy rebuke of Moore.) However, it’s not just the words and deeds of the president that matter.Evangelical voters formed a key component of Trump’s path to victory. Yet the fallout from Southern Baptist leader Paige Patterson’s controversial comments about, and to, female parishioners—including encouraging one to remain in a physically abusive marriage—exposed the widening gender rift among one of the key conservative voting blocs. While male leaders wrestled with how to grapple with an originally unapologetic Patterson, women evangelicals started a petition that is believed to have resulted in Patterson stepping down from his role. But questions remain about how the situation was handled – by the men in charge.And then we have Roseanne.So much of the debates about race of the Obama and Trump eras have focused on “micro-aggressions” or coded racist language, and “dog whistles” with racist undertones. Subtle racism, while very real and very dangerous, is hard to prove and explain. As a result, there were plenty of those who pulled the lever for Trump who took the position that if they’re not racist themselves and if they voted for Trump for valid policy reasons, plenty of other people who voted for him must have equally valid reasons. Roseanne Barr’s appalling ape reference to former Obama policy advisor Valerie Jarrett reinforced that David Duke’s support of the Trump campaign was not a one-off. There are plenty of people with blatantly racist attitudes who see the current president as their voice.Moments like these are likely to cause some of the women who voted for Trump because he was allegedly the lesser of two evils, to reevaluate how they define evil and to reevaluate whether they want to remain a part of a party which seems to have forgotten that when it comes to family values, all members of the family should be treated with love and respect, regardless of their race or gender."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'What an amateur show. Virtually every step of the way, from the moment when Donald Trump surprised even his own staff by announcing a summit with North Korea, it was obvious, I mean achingly obvious, that the president had no idea what he was doing. You hear that laughter? It’s the world, and they’re not laughing at Princess Beatrice’s hat. Let’s retrace. It’s the evening of Thursday, March 8—an otherwise normal day in Trumpland, in what has become of the United States. The administration was scrambling to stave off a ballooning crisis that it created by announcing steel and aluminum tariffs with nearly zero forethought and actual preparation. They’d caught most people totally off guard, including a good number of Republicans who were saying, “Hey, wait a minute here, are we sure this is a good thing?” On that day, The New York Times reported: “More than 100 Republican lawmakers implored President Trump to drop his plans for stiff and sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs as the White House prepared to formalize the measures on Thursday afternoon.” That’s when the administration started to backtrack and say, well, maybe we can find a way to carve out some exemptions for certain countries after all.That was crisis one that day (that day!!). Crisis two was arguably even bigger. The Times reported that Michael Cohen had obtained a temporary restraining order against Stormy Daniels to prevent her from speaking out about her relationship with the president. This was a big development in the Stormy saga and catnip for cable news (this is before we knew Trump re-paid Cohen the $130,000 in hush money fees). That was now Topic A that day. And then, in the late afternoon, after meeting with South Korea’s national security adviser, Trump dropped the bombshell. As CNN wrote it up:Peeking around a half-opened pocket door, Trump caught the eye of a small handful of reporters and drew them closer to him. First, he asked to speak off the record, but with an ounce of prodding agreed to go on the record, as long as his remarks remained off camera."South Korea\'s going to be making a major statement at about 7 o\'clock," Trump said ceremoniously. Vice President Mike Pence stood silently behind him."About what?" a puzzled reporter asked."The big subject," Trump replied, his scowl turning into a grin.— cnnIs it possible  that Trump was watching cable news and freaking out about the negative coverage on the tariffs and especially on Stormy? It certainly seems likely. Imagine him thinking: I need a change of subject here fast! So he stuns his own advisers who were in the Oval Office with the South Korean representative—McMaster, Mattis, and Kelly—by accepting on the spur of the moment this offer from Mr. Chung, the South Korean, for a summit. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if someday we learn that there was no such “offer.” That it was all Trump’s idea from jump street, just trying to make cable TV talk about something else that night.To that extent, it worked. Wow, talking heads gushed. He’s done what no president before him could do! Improbable as it seems, maybe if anyone can cut this deal, Trump can! Google “Trump Korea Nobel Prize” and your machine will return you 7.55 million depressingly comedic results. “Everyone thinks so,” Trump said of the possibility of being bestowed with such an honor. “But I would never say it.” There were voices, yes, that warned that maybe doing something like this on the spur of the moment wasn’t the world’s best idea. That something like this takes planning. That maybe there’s a reason a bilateral summit with North Korea just hasn’t magically happened in these last 80 years, and maybe even diplomats—dour, bureaucratic men and women that they are, always seeing the complicated side of things—have a point about treading carefully into these waters.Bah! Small-minded people! Trump is too great for your small minds to comprehend! You merely describe reality; the great man remakes it! #MAGA #MAGA #MAGA!Needless to say, nearly everything that had happened since March 8 has been, at best, a misfire and, at worst, a disaster. Not the release of those three Americans. That was unambiguously a good thing. But everything else. Kim was elevated in this process to being not merely the equal of the President of the United States but, in some ways, his superior, the one who set the terms by which this process advanced (and then ended). One day, complete denuclearization meant one thing; another day it meant another thing. One day the summit was the most important thing in the world. The next day it was well, who knows, if it happens, great, if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. Trump even went out of his way to call Kim a “very honorable” man.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

If she had bolted out of the Oval Office to make an announcement like the one Trump made with no forethought, to get a bad email story out of the cable news wheel?The right would have been having epileptic seizures. Weeks ago they would have begun calling her and her top people traitors. By now, about 60 percent of America, or at least of Republicans, would have believed that Hillary Clinton was literally Manchuria’s candidate.The only thing that prevents us from believing that about Trump is—well, there are two. The first is the commonly held perception that he’s simply too ignorant; that he had no idea what he was doing when he agreed to the summit. The second is that he can’t be Manchuria’s candidate because he’s already the Kremlin’s. Well, the Kremlin would want a president who weakened America, discredited it, made it a laughing stock. Mission Accomplished.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Dana Bash said it was supposed to be a “somewhat lighthearted” question. Kellyanne Conway did not take it that way. Toward the end of a long interview during which Conway dodged question after question about her boss’ legal troubles, Bash asked her, “What is up with your husband’s tweets?” Conway’s permanent smile began to fade ever so slightly as Bash explained that George Conway, a prominent lawyer, has been surprisingly critical of President Donald Trump on Twitter over the past year and a half. Many of those tweets have since been deleted, but one that remains on his account from March calls a report that Trump considered pardons for Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort “flabbergasting.” After somehow working in yet another dig at Hillary Clinton, Conway told Bash, “It’s fascinating to me that CNN would go there. But it’s very good for the whole world to just witness that it’s now fair game how people’s spouses and significant others may differ with them. I’m really surprised, but very, in some ways, relieved and gratified to see that.”Taken aback by Conway’s response, Bash insisted that she would have asked the same question if the gender roles were reversed. “No you wouldn’t,” Conway interrupted her, to which Bash replied, “A thousand percent I would.”“You just brought him into this, so this ought to be fun moving forward, Dana,” a furious Conway said. “We’re now going to talk about other people’s spouses and significant others just because they either work at the White House or at CNN? Are we now going to do that? Because you just went there. CNN just went there.” When Bash said she wasn’t trying to be “critical,” Conway said, “Of course it was, it was meant to harass and embarrass.” “By definition, spouses have a difference of opinion when adultery is happening,” Conway added, cryptically. “By definition, spouses have a difference of opinion when one is, I don’t know, draining the joint bank account to support things that maybe the other disagrees with. So this is a fascinating ‘cross the Rubicon’ moment and I’ll leave it at that.”As Bash tried to ease the tension between them, Conway only ratcheted it up, accusing the anchor of talking out of turn about her marriage and even bringing her children into it. “Kellyanne, here was my whole point in this, is that you are a professional working for the president of the United States and your husband is a very well-respected lawyer,” Bash told her, “and my point is that we don’t often see—in fact, I don’t remember the last time we saw—somebody working for the president in a high-profile position when their spouse is saying critical things about them. That is all.”Of course, this being Kellyanne Conway, that was not all. “CNN chose to go there,” she said. “I think that’s going to be fascinating moving forward.” In her next breath, Conway was defending her boss for calling the wife of his former Deputy Director FBI Director Andrew McCabe a “loser.” '},
 {'title': 'Cynthia Nixon Picks Up Major Endorsement From the Left',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Cynthia Nixon on Monday picked up another endorsement from the left in her race against incumbent New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo. The former Sex and the City star and longtime political activist won the official backing of Our Revolution, the political organization spun off from Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) presidential campaign.“Cynthia Nixon is a lifelong progressive who has spent years working on educational equity. She is a bold progressive who is running in the spirit of Senator Bernie Sanders,” Our Revolution head Nina Turner said in a statement. “Cynthia is running to be a governor for the people, not for the billionaires and corporations who have held influence over New York's Democratic establishment for far too long.”Nixon responded to the endorsement praising the organization and the movement Sanders began in 2016: “The activists, grassroots organizers, and leaders of Our Revolution are at the heart of the progressive movement in this country, and I’m proud to join them in the fight to create a more\xa0democratic\xa0Democratic Party.”Our Revolution has notably gotten involved in Democratic primaries independent of Sanders.For the recent Ohio Democratic gubernatorial primary, the group backed former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who got trounced by Richard Cordray, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Sanders, however, remained mum on the contest. The organization also recently endorsed Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed. As for New York, Sanders previously declined to endorse in the primary but told The New York Times: “Governor Cuomo has a strong record, he has done some very good things, obviously there are areas where I disagree with him. Cynthia seems to be generating a lot of grass-roots enthusiasm running on a progressive platform.”Nixon’s challenge from the left, coupled with her reliance on small-dollar contributions, has led to natural comparisons between her upstart candidacy and Sanders’ tough 2016 race against eventual Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In addition to Our Revolution, Nixon was endorsed by influential liberal blog Daily Kos, The Working Families Party and Democracy for America, the progressive PAC founded by former Vermont Governor Howard Dean."},

  'body': "BROOKLYN, New York—Winsome Pendergrass, a 59-year-old resident of Flatbush, was having the rarest of experiences early Tuesday afternoon: an actually enjoyable ride on a Manhattan-bound 3 train. “I’m a celebrity, look who’s my friend,” Pendergrass explained. “Put it in the papers.”Next to Pendergrass sat Cynthia Nixon, the longtime activist and star of Sex and the City, who had just completed her inaugural event in her campaign for governor of New York. As the two chatted, wedged in a row of seats facing a cadre of television cameras, another woman was pulled into an interview with NBC 4 after she considered getting off the train. The train hurtled to a stop and the media mob swayed. Earlier on in the day, Pendergrass and Nixon exchanged a laugh. Asked about it later on, the Brooklyn native recalled the line she had delivered to her new celebrity-politician friend. “Everybody in the city is having sex, but tenants not getting any,” said Pendergrass. “We’re getting screwed over.” As she campaigns for governor of New York, Cynthia Nixon may not be able to escape her identity as Miranda. But she can hope to meld it into something politically potent. During her first day on the trail, she managed to exemplify a kind of leftist ideal for a Democrat running against an entrenched, money-beholden incumbent from the same party—one with political bonafides in the activist community. And yet, her candidacy remains bound by a tension, as seen by her interactions on the train. Nixon, for better or worse, is being propelled by her celebrity even as she makes charges that the elites have had it way too good.Instead of running away from that, Nixon is openly acknowledging it, saying in her first ad that she was given chances growing up in the city that she doesn’t see for children these days. Earlier in the day, Nixon had swung by the Bethesda Healing Center, a multicultural congregation in Brownsville near East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Entering into a small room to chants of “CYN-THI-A, CYN-THI-A,” she was treated like a populist hero—an HBO fixture-turned avatar for progressive change.Nixon was late to the event, like most New Yorkers are late to essentially everything these days. And she and her campaign went to great lengths to emphasize this, documenting her trip on Twitter, to the largely minority voter-filled Brownsville audience.“I got here just in the nick of time,” Nixon said at a podium in front of a large CYNTHIA FOR NY sign. “I allowed an hour and a half for what should have been a 30 minute ride. Cuomo’s MTA.” Cuomo would be the governor, Andrew Cuomo, whose tenure in Albany has inspired scorn among national progressives and eye-rolls among New York City denizens, primarily for the rising dysfunction of the city’s sprawling subway network. It is the provincial thorn in the side of the governor’s office and a rallying cry for every New Yorker with access to Twitter. “FIX THE GODDAMN TRAINS,” is a social media staple during frenzied morning commutes.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Though her professional roots are in acting, Nixon is no political neophyte. She’s been involved in numerous political causes and clearly knows a campaign cudgel when she sees it. She has taken note of the MTA horror show and used it against Cuomo, casting him as an elitist insider who has let public transportation (not to mention education and affordable housing) wither on the vine. She assailed Cuomo for kowtowing to corporate interests in language that was just as sharp as a speech from Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and even seemed to echo Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. “New York for the many,” Nixon declared, “not just the few.” She tore into Cuomo for taking cash from David Koch and his wife in 2011 and for his lack of small dollar contributions in general. “If you are a regular person in New York,” Nixon declared, “the chance that Andrew Cuomo is going to care about your concerns is exactly that: 0.1 percent.”It was a sharp, pithy, and ultimately effective line (at least judging on crowd reactions). But it doesn’t say much about Nixon’s road ahead. Campaigns aren’t just speeches. They are continuous conversations, both with voters and the opposition. And no sooner had Nixon started running for governor than Cuomo’s allies hit back. \xa0“Cynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City. Now she wants to be an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York,” former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a Cuomo supporter, said in an interview with the New York Post. Quinn, a lesbian, was referring to Nixon’s decision to back New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio over her in the 2013 Democratic primary. Even seasoned New York political observers were a bit stunned by how quickly Nixon had gotten under Cuomo’s skin. And though Quinn later apologized, the expectations are that the next few months will turn into a bitter political affair. Whether Nixon has the chops to endure it will be the defining question of the race. Certainly there is enough antipathy towards Cuomo to give her an opening.“I’m set to go right now,” 66-year-old Norman Frazier told The Daily Beast. He had previously voted for Cuomo but was more enthused about Nixon, particularly after hearing her speak. Traipsing away from East 98th Street towards the Sutter Avenue-Rutland Road train station after addressing the Brownsville audience, Nixon chit-chatted with voters about affordable housing and the impending Nor’Easter that is hurtling down on the city on the first day of spring. When she ducked into the station, she briefly spoke to reporters on the platform, her words nearly drowned out by an MTA announcement saying that, once again, there were delays, this time due to the tragic death of a young MTA employee. On the train she talked to Pendergrass, who had walked with her from the Bethesda Healing Center and now seemed open to the possibility that a previous television star could very well run the state. Especially, if that person was Nixon. “Well if Donald Trump is in there, I don’t see why she can’t go,” Pendergrass said. "},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Don Blankenship, the ex-convict mine owner running for Senate in West Virginia, is intensifying his war against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ahead of the Republican primary next Tuesday. Blankenship, who has fallen behind his competitors Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in recent polling, released a bizarre ad on Monday in which he referred to McConnell as "cocaine Mitch." “One of my goals as U.S. senator will be to ditch Cocaine Mitch,” Blankenship says in the ad which appears to no longer be featured on his Facebook page. On Tuesday, Blankenship’s campaign sought to explain the term by blaming McConnell for the alleged misdeeds of a company owned by the father of McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.“Mitch McConnell and his family have extensive ties to China,” the campaign said in a statement. “His father-in-law who founded and owns a large Chinese shipping company has given Mitch and his wife millions of dollars over the years. The\xa0company was implicated recently in smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Europe, hidden aboard a company ship carrying foreign coal was $7 million dollars of cocaine and that is why we’ve deemed him ‘Cocaine Mitch.’”The campaign pointed to a 2014 article from The Nation which reported that drugs were found on the Ping May, a vessel owned by McConnell\'s wife\'s family. “A new book by Peter Schweizer examines how career politician Mitch McConnell used his elected influence and his wife’s family’s policies to get rich while regular Americans lost a trade war,” the Blankenship press release continued. “A trade war that has cost millions their jobs and therefore created idleness and despair, which as we know leads to illegal drug use including cocaine. Cocaine overdose deaths in the United States are rising rapidly as a result.”This is far from the first time Blankenship has lobbed wild attacks at McConnell and his wife. Last week on a West Virginia radio show that McConnell has a conflict of interest because Chao\'s father is a “wealthy Chinaperson” and “and there’s a lot of connections to some of the brass, in you will, in China.”In response, McConnell said: ‘My father-in-law is an American, who lives in New York. Works in New York. And I don’t have any comment about ridiculous observations like that.” '},
 {'title': 'Former Trump Aide Michael Caputo Wants to Give Roseanne Reboot a New Home',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Less than 24 hours after the Roseanne reboot was canceled, former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo began plotting ways to get her back on air.Caputo is the chief marketing officer of an online streaming TV startup called Bond, which aims to fund film and television programming through “crowd-investing.” He told The Daily Beast that he and his colleagues plan “to reach out to Roseanne [Barr] immediately” in the wake of the cancellation of her ABC show on Tuesday over a series of racist and anti-Semitic tweets.Despite the controversy surrounding Barr, the rebooted Roseanne earned huge ratings and plenty of headlines for its star’s support for President Donald Trump. Caputo, who helped run Trump’s New York campaign, hopes to capitalize on that popularity. If he were to do so, it would be a coup for Bond, which was founded last year but has yet to begin airing content on its streaming service.“We always planned on reaching out to Roseanne eventually,” Caputo told The Daily Beast. “Now it’s sooner rather than later.”A show on Caputo’s streaming service would be a major step down in terms of audience size for Barr, whose show set viewership records in its short-lived tenure. Caputo says Bond is aiming for 150 original content creators to draw 75,000 paying subscribers in its first year. By contrast, the first episode of ABC’s Roseanne reboot drew more than 27 million viewers.But Roseanne has become persona non grata in Hollywood, ever more so after a series of tweets that called liberal financier George Soros, who is Jewish, a Nazi collaborator and compared Valerie Jarrett, an African American adviser to former president Barack Obama, to an ape. A new home at Bond would, potentially, insulate Barr from backlash to her consistently controversial politics and public statements. Caputo, for one, views it as a cleaner ideological fit than ABC ever was. In slideshow presentations pitching its streaming service to various potential investors, Bond even used the Roseanne reboot as a model for the type of programming that the company could support. Caputo said that model was used explicitly to lure conservative-minded backers eager to tip the balance of political power in Hollywood.The Daily Beast obtained a pair of slides from that presentation, which hyped “The Roseanne Effect” and declared that the Roseanne reboot was “disrupting Hollywood orthodoxy,” and that while the show was “panned by Hollywood” and “ridiculed by Liberal America,” its key demographic—“pro-Trump middle America”—had been “ignored by elites.”“Roseanne may have a domino effect on Hollywood,” the presentation predicted, and Bond would facilitate that effect. It “accelerates [the] end of [the] Hollywood elite.”Another presentation on Bond’s website pitches the service in Russian for the benefit of potential investors in that country, where its co-founders, Vlad Lobak and Den Tolmor, were born.Russian involvement in Bond prompted some interest by Senate investigators probing Kremlin influence on the 2016 presidential election. Caputo told The Daily Beast that the Senate Intelligence Committee asked “about my present business with Russian partners,” and that he provided the committee with a couple of the slideshows. “They didn’t seem all that intrigued and we didn’t talk about it,” he recalled. “The Mueller team was even less interested.”Though Caputo acknowledged pitching explicitly conservative potential investors on Roseanne’s appeal, he said Bond is reaching out to “video and filmmakers of all genres, not just conservatives,” to “every creator who is sick of pennies from YouTube and can’t get a meeting with a Hollywood God.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.As for how a reboot of the Roseanne reboot on the Bond platform would work, Caputo described the crowd investing model as follows: “Roseanne would join Bond, upload a proposal for new content and fans would buy shares. As her new content is uploaded, a small piece of each viewer's subscription would be paid to Roseanne. Her user-investors would profit from her success or lose their investment if she flops.”For Caputo, there’s a bit of a personal feud at stake too. His pitch to Roseanne comes more than a quarter century after he himself clashed with Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, ABC’s parent company. And like the Roseanne tiff, that dispute had to do with the cancellation of a popular television show.In the early 1990s, Caputo helped organize a grassroots campaign to pressure Iger, then the president of ABC Entertainment, into reversing a decision to cancel the hit show Twin Peaks. Caputo, a massive fan of the show, and his group—Citizens Opposing the Offing of Peaks—scored a partial victory, convincing ABC to air the remaining six episodes of the show’s ongoing season, but it was subsequently canceled.Caputo said the Twin Peaks ordeal was “the seed of my interest in Bond.” He added, “In the Bond model, there is no Bob Iger.”"},
 {'title': '#MeToo Men Keep Bouncing Back. We Should Make That F*cking Difficult.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "My parents kept a small flock of chickens when I was a kid. When I was really small—too small to fully process what I was witnessing—I’d watch my father butcher the ones we’d raised for meat. It was always fast. But after their heads had been lopped off by the axe, what was left of them would flop around like feathered basketballs for longer than it seemed like they should. Their bodies carried on like their heads were still attached. I thought about those chickens a lot last fall, as the #MeToo movement decapitated the careers of men from a wide cross-section of industries. They would lay low like the whole thing would blow over, or they’d react defensively, or they’d do one and then the other. You could read their envisioned future comebacks between the lines of their public apologies. Like their heads were still attached. Back then, I’d see a flailing apology and think, you don’t even know you’re dead. Those who fancy themselves voices of reason warned against “killing” men’s careers after #MeToo stories broke, as though the public is a single entity that can be reasoned with. After CNN reporting revealed Mark Halperin to be a habitual creep, my Daily Beast colleague Lloyd Grove got Halperin’s fellow pundit Mike Barnicle on the record saying, “He deserves to be punished for what he did. He deserves to have what he did be deplored. But does he deserve to die? How many times can you kill a guy?” Now that six months have passed since the first wave of #MeToo stories, several men have decided that enough time has passed that they can resurrect their dead careers as though nothing ever happened. They live! But were they ever dead? Some men did face professional annihilation as a result of their behavior’s exposure. Harvey Weinstein, who it seems got into film in order to pursue his true passion of sexual assault, has been ostracized, his name has been stripped from things, his earth salted (mostly with his own self-pitying tears). Steve Wynn, the casino magnate/RNC finance chair who allegedly operated from a creepy playbook very similar to Weinstein’s, has lost his business (the RNC, interestingly enough, still hasn’t returned the money he donated, since the money itself didn’t sexually coerce any masseuses).But those men are the exception, not the rule. The other day, I was discussing #MeToo with a female friend. I told her that I believed that society had changed irreversibly, that certain behavior was no longer tolerated in any industry, that we’d scraped the mold off. She shrugged and quipped: “Bill Cosby’s still touring.” No, really, he is.And it’s not just Cosby. Woody Allen just last year made a movie with Justin Timberlake, a man who wore a Time’s Up pin to an award ceremony like people wouldn’t say anything. People still went to see it. Casey Affleck is still making movies. R. Kelly is still disgusting and people still listen to his music. Given the durability of the male career, it makes sense that men felled during #MeToo’s initial catharsis last fall would attempt comebacks. In the last few weeks, a handful of the men accused of, let’s call it “monstrousness-minus,” are testing the waters. Matt Lauer is hoping the world of New York media will use its secret desk button to unlock the doghouse, so he can get back to bringing America his aggressive brand of beige again. Louis CK’s comeback, who some in comedy seemed convinced was imminent, is extra-imminent now. Mario Batali is “eyeing his second act.” Charlie Rose went out with Sean Penn. Al Franken might be working on a third act. What should we make of all these attempted #MeToo comebacks? Can someone exposed for these types of misdeeds get another chance professionally? More importantly, should they? If I hated a man’s first or second act, then why would I stick around after the intermission? The socially progressive party line attitude toward these questions seems to be blanket rejection. I understand where people are coming from in wanting to purge those who committed sexual misconduct from their industries, forever. Sexual misconduct robs the world of potential. Being harassed fucking sucks and there’s something unsettling about imagining a sexual harasser being able to one day mine his own feelings about being a sexual harasser and profit from it. But there is no actual court of public opinion, there is no boss of comedy, or movies. That means that in the end, we’ll all have to decide on our own whether we’ll indulge men who have done bad things. Over the next few months, we’re all probably going to spend a lot of time and energy assessing the sincerity of male apology tours.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.I’ve struggled with how to approach the non-bad work of bad men. A few years back, I went to a screening of Woody Allen’s Manhattan scored live by the New York Philharmonic. I can’t say that seeing Allen have a romance with a teenager onscreen was a pleasurable experience, even alongside a live orchestral rendition of “Rhapsody in Blue.” An R. Kelly song played at a bar always distracts me from whatever it was I was talking about (last time it happened, I had to spend the four minutes of “Ignition” railing on what trash R. Kelly is to whoever will listen). The fact that Sean Penn is such an aggressively shitty writer makes me happy, because he seems to be an aggressively shitty person. And yet, while I know I can’t consume art made by these men anymore, I also don’t want to destroy it, nor do I want to prevent other people from consuming it if they choose. It exists. I don’t want to burn it down. I don’t want to pretend it never existed. I just wish we could somehow process it with disclaimers about their moral cost, like confederate statues. The truth is, there are no good answers to these questions. But there are certain principles that should underline our collective thinking about them. Chief among them is that it should be at least as hard for a man to resurrect his career post-#MeToo as it was for the women he harassed to continue to advance in their fields. That’s to say, it should be very fucking difficult. But not impossible. It’s silly to paint every man implicated in #MeToo with the same broad brush. It’s shortsighted to dismiss everything every one of those men does post-#MeToo as opportunistic trash. A lot of it will be! But not all of it. There’s a difference between opportunistic trash and a thoughtful evolution that acknowledges past transgressions and proactively works to right those wrongs. To borrow a line from Louis CK: Of course. But maybe! Of course sexual harassment is bad. But maybe somebody like Louis CK might have some important thoughts about coming to terms with the harm he’s caused, especially if he, say, donates part of the proceeds from his next tour to organizations that empower women. Aziz Ansari would make a positive contribution to this discussion if he were to turn the story that branded him with a moral question mark into a carefully crafted episode of Master of None. Millennials are shitty at communicating about sex and millennial men have a difficult time behaving empathetically when they’re horny; let’s explore that with some self-awareness. I’ll cast the most gimlet-y of gimlet eyes on every post-#MeToo comeback attempt. I’ll have to remind myself, over and over, that sometimes shitty people make good art or have politics I agree with, and that a lot of good art was made at the expense of women’s well-being. It’s an uncomfortable truth to face, but refusing to live in a world where both art and evil exist concurrently means that our world is split into two, each living in their own preferred version of half-reality. I can’t reject art I haven’t seen. I can’t reject apologies I haven’t heard. That being said, fuck James Toback. "},

After publication, a spokesperson sent a statement saying that Avenue “reached out to us in early 2017, pitching their services. We agreed to one meeting. We had no interest and there was no contract.”Its discussions with the lobbying firm took place, shortly after Avenue was founded by former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Barry Bennett, a senior adviser on the campaign. Avenue also brought on Ed Brookover, a Republican operative who helped the Trump campaign wrangle delegates at the 2016 convention, and Jason Osborne and Mike Rubino, two other senior Trump campaign hands who later founded their own lobbying firm, Turnberry Solutions.At the time, Avenue was up-front about the value it could provide in the Trump era. “There are just so few people in Washington who know the president,’’ Lewandowski told The New York Times in February 2017. ‘‘It’s a comparative advantage.’’According to one source, familiar with the discussions AT&T and Avenue discussed a political consulting arrangement that would not entail official lobbying, and would cost the company in the range of $40,000 per month. But no agreement was ever reached.Nevertheless, the terms of the proposed deal were similar to those arranged with Cohen’s company, Essential Consultants LLC—high fees, and no official lobbying. AT&T paid the firm about $600,000, the company acknowledged this week, for work on issues that included its proposed merger with cable company Time Warner.Controversy over AT&T’s relationship with Cohen resulted in the early retirement on Friday of the senior executive who oversaw the arrangement.“Everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate,” wrote AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson in a Friday memo to its employees. “But the fact is, our past association with Cohen was a serious misjudgment” and “our reputation has been damaged.”While AT&T’s deal with Cohen was entirely legal, ethics watchdogs say it also illuminated an ugly underbelly of Washington’s influence industry, in which thousands of consultants and government relations executives seek to subtly shift policy in ways that fall short of the legal definition of “lobbying”—and hence do not need to be publicly disclosed.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

So too was Avenue, and AT&T wasn’t the only one that approached the firm.Tobacco giant Altria also struck a consulting deal with Avenue, a source familiar with the arrangement told The Daily Beast. The details of that arrangement—including fees paid and the specific nature of the firm’s work on the company's behalf—were not immediately clear, though the source said Altria is no longer an Avenue client.Lobbying disclosure filings show that the company was keenly interested in how the White House and Congress were proposing to reform the nation’s tax code last year. Altria’s lobbyists also reported contacting the Executive Office of the President regarding policies surrounding vapor nicotine products.Altria did not respond to a request for comment on its work with Avenue.Both Altria and AT&T pushed early to get in the Trump’s administration’s good graces. The latter donated $2 million to the president’s inaugural committee, which shattered fundraising records thanks in large measure to corporate contributions. Altria chipped in $500,000.—with additional reporting by Gideon Resnick"},
 {'title': 'Elliott Broidy’s Company Got Its Biggest U.S. Government Job Ever While He Pitched Trump Administration',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Editor’s Note, 5/24/18: This article has been updated throughout to clarify Circinus secured jobs from the Defense Department in 2017 on a contract that was signed in 2014. The article previously stated a lawyer for Broidy was contacted but did not respond. We regret the error.At the same time Elliott Broidy was cashing in on his access to President Trump by pitching him on behalf of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, he was also receiving the biggest payouts in the history of his company from the U.S. government. Monday, the Associated Press reported on the months-long 2017 lobbying effort carried out by Broidy and George Nader that brought the pair close to securing nearly $1 billion in contracts with the Saudis and the Emiratis in exchange for lobbying against their enemy, Qatar. Also during the pair’s lobbying blitz in the fall of 2017, Broidy’s company received its largest jobs to date from the federal government on a previously signed contract, The Daily Beast has learned.The company, a Virginia-based security firm called Circinus LLC, is owned by Broidy and has secured at least $800 million in foreign defense contracts since Trump took office. All of those payouts came after Broidy reportedly worked his contacts in D.C.—including Trump—to advocate for positions favorable to the countries that Circinus now lists as clients. Broidy has denied any wrongdoing.In addition to its newfound international fortune, Circinus received Defense Department payments totalling more than $4 million in August and September 2017, the largest in the company’s history, a review of available contracts found. (Two months later, Broidy funneled almost $200,000 into Michael Cohen’s bank accounts to pay off a Playboy model Broidy had impregnated, according to financial documents leaked to The New Yorker last week. The model received $1.6 million for her silence and Broidy resigned from his position with the RNC in the ensuing public relations fallout.)Circinus, formed in 2001, has been bidding on jobs, known as “task orders,” with the Pentagon since 2011, but has had limited success. In 2014, the company signed a contract with the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) for unidentified intelligence services. It won a task order for $5,000 that year, according to public records. Broidy purchased Circinus in 2015. Prior to 2017, Circinus had been paid a total of just $7,501 for its work on various defense jobs, according to the government’s contract database. “The government site only tracks prime contract holders revenue and not sub-contracted work,” a lawyer for Broidy told The Daily Beast. “The majority of Circinus’s revenue was through subcontracts, which are simply not reported on the government database.”Then, in August 2017 it finally received $3.9 million for a task order, nearly doubling the company’s income for the year. The following month, Circinus received $242,011 from the Defense Security Service for a separate task order. The INSCOM task orders were made possible thanks to a 2015 Government Accountability Office decision to quash a protest over the bidding process brought by one of Circinus’ competitors. Other administrative changes to the contract pushed back the payment date to Aug. 18, 2017. INSCOM did not respond to a request for comment regarding the payment or details of the contract. Representatives of Circinus could not be reached for comment and the company’s website was taken down some time after Feb. 8, according to the Internet Archive.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Circinus has seen a boon in business since Trump took office. In addition to the more than $4 million in U.S. defense task orders it inked in late 2017, Broidy’s company has secured a reported $200 million in deals with the state-owned Romanian defense company Romarm. That’s in addition to the $600 million contract Broidy secured with the UAE, which came after two Oval Office meetings with Trump in late 2017 where Broidy lobbied the president on several fronts favorable to the Emiratis.The Romanian contracts came after Broidy gave “unsolicited input” to Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican who serves as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, just before Royce visited Romania in August 2017. Documents obtained by McClatchy appear to show that Broidy was in Romania at the same time. Broidy also worked Royce on behalf of the Saudis and Emiratis, claiming he had “shifted” the lawmaker into “being critical of Qatar,” the AP reported on Monday.Royce—who received the maximum legal campaign contribution from Broidy—eventually backed legislation critical of Qatar.Broidy’s personal emails, hacked and shared with several media outlets in February, show that the fall of 2017 was a particularly busy time for him—and not just because Circinus had received the biggest government payouts in its history.In August, Broidy tried to influence a Justice Department investigation into the Malaysian state-run company 1MBD, according to the emails. Included in the hacked correspondences was a draft of a contract that would have netted Broidy $75 million if the Justice Department investigation came to an end, according to emails obtained by The Wall Street Journal. Broidy’s attorney denied his client tried to insert himself into the investigation.But in addition to his direct access to Trump, Broidy also has a relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who sought Broidy’s recommendations for U.S. attorney nominees shortly after Trump was elected, ProPublica reported. Broidy, a lifelong venture capitalist with interest in developing movies, has no background in legal work.Broidy’s emails also reportedly show how he used his access to Trump to work on behalf of the UAE, with whom Circinus first went into business when it signed hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts shortly after the election. More would follow, thanks to Broidy’s access to Trump and Nader working his benefactors among Saudi and Emirati royalty.In October 2017, Broidy provided a dispatch of an Oval Office meeting between himself and Trump to Nader, who had cultivated Broidy as a partner in working within the White House to advocate for the positions of the Saudis and Emiratis. During one of two Oval Office visits, Broidy advocated for getting rid of then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was seen as insufficiently hostile to Qatar. In the same Oval Office meeting, Broidy made clear that Tillerson had to go. “President Trump asked me about the job Rex was doing,” Broidy reported to Nader following the meeting. “I responded that he was performing poorly and should be relieved but only at a good time, politically.”It now appears that Nader’s cultivation of Broidy as a White House contact—and the pair’s success in achieving some of the goals of the Saudis and Emiratis—was the culmination of a lobbying long game that began before Americans even went to the polls in November 2016. On Sunday, The New York Times reported that Nader attended a meeting just before the 2016 election that included Donald Trump Jr., Trump campaign senior adviser Stephen Miller, Blackwater co-founder Erik Prince, and others. At the meeting, Nader spoke on behalf of the Emiratis and Saudis who offered support for Trump in his quest for the presidency."},
 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani Says President Trump Couldn’t Even Be Indicted for Murder',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Rudy Giuliani—presidential attorney, ambulant lawyer joke and apparent Scandal superfan—told HuffPost on Sunday that President Donald Trump cannot be indicted for any crime so long as he holds the nation’s highest office — not even murder.“In no case can he be subpoenaed or indicted—I don’t know how you can indict while he’s in office. No matter what it is,” Giuliani told HuffPost’s S.V. Dáte. “If he shot James Comey, he’d be impeached the next day. Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him.”The scenario—which even Giuliani admitted was extreme—is the latest in a series of legally questionable comments made by the president’s outside counsel regarding Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.Earlier on Sunday, Giuliani said on ABC’s This Week that Trump “probably” possesses the constitutional authority to pardon himself. “He has no intention of pardoning himself, but he probably—not to say he can’t.” The comments come one day after the publishing of a memo, penned by Trump’s legal team and delivered to Mueller’s in January, alleging that Trump’s firing of James Comey as FBI director could not have amounted to obstruction of justice because the president, as head of all federal investigations, is inherently incapable of committing it. In the memo, Trump’s the attorneys argued that the Constitution has empowered Trump to, “if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon.”\xa0Giuliani, pressed on NBC’s Meet the Press about the president’s constitutional ability to pardon his own crimes, admitted that the “hypothetical” scenario was “unthinkable,” and would likely end in impeachment.A former associate White House counsel told The Daily Beast that although “this whole area of law is undecided”—the area in question being whether the president can be indicted while in office—their gut response was that Giuliani may be on to something.“I would think the president can be tried for a crime that is related to the office,” the former counsel said, “but his personal crimes may be on hold during the presidency.”Under this scenario, it is unclear whether shooting a sitting FBI director would count as a personal crime or one related to the office of the president, but, as Giuliani said on Sunday, “It’s a hypothetical point.”'},
 {'title': 'The Father Patrick Conroy Mess Shows How the Know-Nothing Spirit Lives On in the House GOP',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'An incredible thing happened in the middle of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s bungled effort to rid himself of Father Patrick Conroy, chaplain of the House of Representatives. Mark Walker (R-NC)—who is a Baptist minister as well as a congressman—opined that the successor to Father Conroy, a Roman Catholic, should have a wife and family. Since Catholic priests are celibate, they would necessarily fail to qualify for the post. Though the issue is moot since Conroy is staying on after Ryan backed down in the face of a public outcry, Walker’s views are a bracing reminder of the specter of bigotry that has stalked our nation from its earliest days. The \xa0historical bias against Catholics—with echoes in our own times—was fueled by a Nativist reaction to Irish immigration. It was stoked by ethnic disdain, religious hatred, economic fears and patriotic passions. The Yankee-Irish riots of the 1830s and ’40s were followed by full-scale political action in the 1850s after the influx of three million Irish and German immigrants fleeing famine and persecution between 1845 and 1854. This influx, the largest in U.S. history relative to the native population, prompted a reaction by the anti-immigrant Know Nothings who sprang from a flag-waving Order of the Star Spangled Banner and appropriated the name of The American Party when they became a national political force. After the Civil War, the Know-Nothings were politically subsumed but their legacy was still powerful. Catholic immigrants faced economic discrimination and political hostility. The American Nativists of the time did not seek to curb immigration but rather to limit Irish political power through such expedients as residency requirements, delayed naturalization, and literacy tests. It was estimated that a third of Irish immigrants—mostly rural and poor—spoke only Gaelic.Invoking fears of a purported Catholic menace was a sure-fire way to unite a fractured Republican Party in the 1870s at the outset of the Gilded Age. The influential Protestant preacher Henry Ward Beecher spoke for many of his co-religionists, when he asserted that while Protestantism nurtured an individual conscience, Catholicism insisted on a corporate one and was thereby unsuited to a democratic United States and could not long endure here. To be sure, the issuing of an embattled Pope’s Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning democracy along with the separation of church and state, did not help matters. The great controversy then, as today, came over education, with the Catholic hierarchy demanding public aid for their schools fearing their children would be indoctrinated by the Protestantism of the non-sectarian public schools. The controversy eventually diminished in a stand-off but the rancor remained. Resentments simmered through the new 20th century, masked by the arrival of a fresh influx of immigrants to target, but emerged in the run-up to World War I in 1917 with German-Americans opposed to U.S. entry into the war and many Irish-Americans having little appetite to fight a war on behalf of a British colonial empire that had bloodily suppressed the Easter rising of 1916. And the postwar era of the 1920s saw the re-emergence of the Ku Klux Klan with its virulently anti-Catholic agenda. Klan demagogues argued that Catholics could only be loyal to the Pope who demanded their absolute allegiance. Therefore, they were \xa0inherently  disloyal to America.  During this era, the Klan boasted more than four million members—more than any American city other than New York. Al Smith’s landslide defeat in the 1924 Presidential election was certainly attributable in part to his Catholicism. Presumably, after the horrors of racialist nationalism were freshly revealed after World War II, it seemed a better era was upon us. Jack Kennedy’s charm, vigor, political savvy and celebrity aura in a new, more tolerant postwar age—together with his promise to keep his religion out of politics—brought America’s first Catholic President to the White House. But while racism and nativism had seemed contained, they are now revived by demography, technology, cultural resentment and economics.Father Conroy suggested that his initial dismissal by Paul Ryan may have been prompted by a prayer he delivered last November in which he expressed his hopes that Congress “guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.” It was a sentiment that he had also mentioned in a Catholic journal and for which he’d been rebuked by the Speaker who told him to “stay out of politics.” But that sentiment is straight from Scripture—among other places in Leviticus 19, where, in its King James English, we are instructed that “Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.”That lawmakers would object to a clergyman urging them to exercise compassion in writing a tax law may say more about the lawmakers than the clergyman. Speaker Ryan himself is Catholic, but he has embraced a political agenda and worldview that hardly seems Christian—one that denigrates asylum seekers and divides a society into the worthy and the unworthy, Americans and aliens, Us and Them.Rep. Walker’s suggestion that Catholics need not apply for the post of House chaplain is a reminder that when bigotry is afoot in the land, no one is safe—not even those who think they are. And the obligation of all Americans is to defend the most vulnerable, whose security provides the litmus test of our democracy and our decency. Jack Schwartz is a former book editor of Newsday. '},
 {'title': 'Democrats Show Zero Tolerance; Republicans, Eh, Not So Much',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The #MeToo movement is a dramatic awakening, with moral victories to be celebrated and inevitable misjudgments to be corrected, but with one thing becoming clear: Democrats have zero tolerance for alleged sexual misconduct among its members. Republicans, not so much. \xa0Nowhere is this more apparent than in the response to the alleged misconduct of two of its rising political stars: Democratic New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was accused in a well-documented New Yorker article by four women he dated of choking and slapping them to the point of requiring medical help, one silenced with the declaration “I am the law.” He initially denied the allegations, claiming consensual role-playing out of Fifty Shades of Grey. Within three hours, when he saw he would get no support from the governor or other Democrats, he resigned. Contrast that with the ongoing saga of GOP supernova Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who sees support no matter what. Republicans have protected him for months amid grisly revelations about an affair with his hairdresser who accused him of binding her arms, coercing her into sex, and threatening to release a nude photo if she told anyone. You would think the party would be too ashamed to keep backing him after a damning report last month by a state House committee with sworn testimony from the victim. \xa0You would be wrong. This is not an aberration for the party of family values. The party’s leaders, evangelical Christians included, are open about countenancing behavior that once sickened them. A dozen office holders have hung on well beyond proof positive that they’d engaged in sexual misconduct, some having their settlements paid for by the taxpayer. Sarah Huckabee Sanders blithely plows on from the White House podium in the face of an admission by President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani that, contrary to what the president swore on Air Force One, he did know of Michael Cohen’s payment to Stephanie Clifford to stay quiet and reimbursed Cohen for it. What’s more, Giuliani revealed, the president could have paid off other women as well, and, well, doesn’t everybody. It’s a strange trickle-out strategy. Still the party repeats the mantra “No one cares about Stormy Daniels” in the same way they said \xa0it was only “locker room talk” when Trump bragged he was so famous he could do anything to women he wanted.   Hypocrisy didn’t begin in 2016. Democrats are censuring their own now but didn’t when multiple women claimed Bill Clinton sexually harassed them and when it came out that he had an affair in the White House. Yes, Monica Lewinsky was a willing partner, but no one thinks it was right for the most powerful man in the world to have his way with a star-struck intern.“The response of Republicans is to bear hug the president, grind it out, and call Democrats politically correct, not morally superior, when they punish their own.”Democrats know better now. Schneiderman was doing God’s work, suing Trump, suing movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, crusading for women, a future governor or president. It didn’t matter. He was a man without a party Monday night.The highest-ranking Republican to accord a woman credibility against an errant Republican is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said “I believe the women” when four came forward to accuse Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual contact when they were in their teens. Sure, he wanted to avoid the spectacle of an accused pedophile being elected to the Senate and appearing before the ethics committee before he even found his desk. Still, it was progress to hear him depart from Trump, use the language of #MeToo and possibly his wife, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, to condemn a fellow Republican. \xa0Of course, Republicans have the additional pressure to ignore or defend Republicans accused of sexual misconduct lest they be asked why they aren’t calling Trump to account as well. Why wouldn’t Greitens hang on as long as his party is hanging in? Pre-Trump, accusations like those against the president, without proof to the contrary stronger than the women are liars and too ugly to bother with, would fell not just a president but also your doctor, your dentist, your candlestick maker. Instead, the response of Republicans is to bear hug the president, grind it out, and call Democrats politically correct, not morally superior, when they punish their own. Democrats gave credence to that point when they raced to push out former Senator Al Franken when the complaints against him were of a lesser order than those against Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and other prominent men. They could have easily granted Franken due process before the existing ethics committee. Showing up Republicans and scoring a point was more important than making it fair. \xa0\xa0The opposite prevailed with White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, who was accused of physically abusing two wives, with an FBI report, denying him a security clearance, documenting it. For months, chief of staff John Kelly and others protected him, arguing he was the model of good behavior in his job. This ignores the facts that bad sexual behavior doesn’t take place in public, that a predator chooses his victims carefully, that a bank robber doesn’t rob every bank. As one of Schneiderman’s accusers pointed out to bolster her charges, he was a classic Jekyll at home and a Hyde publicly. \xa0What also protects the Porters among us is that with midterms to be won and tax cuts to be enjoyed, a Republican doesn’t want to call out one bad actor and risk having to explain why they don’t apply the same standard to everyone else. To the contrary, in a GOP love-in on the steps of the White House just before Christmas, Sen. Orrin Hatch, a hymn-singing Christian, said that Trump’s was “the\xa0greatest presidency\xa0we have seen not only in generations, but maybe\xa0ever.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The movement is still finding its footing, but there are few instances of going too far. \xa0There’s no avalanche of accusers as predicted. No one’s been shown to be lying. Victims still risk being victimized again. With Schneiderman, it was the prospect of one woman being out there alone that prompted the others to speak out. Yet the system in Congress to protect its members is intact. Women who complain on Capitol Hill are largely unemployable while the taxpayer ponies up for member’s settlements. It took 12 years to convict Bill Cosby of violent acts against women who looked up to him. Yet the backlash is in progress. Men openly threaten not to hire women, as if that will teach us to take sexual harassment lying down. Charlie Rose is shopping around a new show devoted to showing how he and others were railroaded. And Eric Greitens, who tied up a woman, is still governor. Democrats are trying to impeach him. We’ll see if the public find that politically correct or the right thing to do. "},
 {'title': 'Don Blankenship Is a Villain of Our Time',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Every age is burdened with the people who most explicitly characterize its grotesqueries and excesses, and every age deserves to see them deliciously taken down. Once upon a time, this kind of thing was done in high literary fashion—say, the way Lytton Strachey did it to Cardinal Manning in Eminent Victorians. Today’s villains aren’t worth nearly that much spit and polish. For Don Blankenship—the erstwhile coal operator and federal convict now trying to worm his way into the United States Senate from West Virginia who is as good a symbol as anyone else of everything that’s foul about our time—a Netflix miniseries someday will suffice, or maybe a few YouTube videos.Episode One will document his rise and culminate in the way his company ignored repeated warnings about safety violations, ultimately resulting in the deaths of 29 miners in 2010, the worst mining accident in America in 40 years. Another episode will focus on his lying campaign to destroy the career of a judge who had more decency in his fingernail that Blankenship will ever have in that whole corpulent body. And it will work its way up to this Senate race—the primary will be held on May 8—where Blankenship trails but with still a large percentage of undecided. Who knows. Donald Trump is president. Weirder things have happened. And all along the way we’ll get the running commentary of the world as Don sees it, such as his choice observations that all things considered he thinks China is a better place than the United States these days. “Americans confuse the words communism and dictatorship,” he said in an interview a few years ago, according to The New York Times. “The \xa0Chinese are running a dictatorial capitalism, and it’s very effective. That’s the way corporations are run. Corporations are not a democracy.”We don’t often get it that plain and unvarnished from these people. He’d prefer a capitalist dictatorship. Capitalist dictatorships recognize the cold, hard realities of life, such as the fact that when you’re racing to extract as much carbon out of the ground as fast as you can, a few miners’ lives are so much spoilage factor. He knew what he was talking about: Though things have improved a bit in recent years, back when Blankenship spoke those words, according to The Economist, China’s coal mines were “tragic showcases of greed, corruption and contempt for life.”Unfortunately for Blankenship, he’s stuck running for office in a democracy, or what remains of it, and so he seems destined not to make it to the Senate. The Republican establishment, the hated swamp, is even against him, running ads Even if he somehow prevails on May 8, it’s generally thought that he’d be the weakest of the three Republicans in November against Democratic incumbent Joe Manchin.So the current chapter of Blankenship’s life will likely end two Tuesdays from now, but that hardly means we’ll be done with him, because as you know that isn’t how things work these days. He’s 68. The Times says he’s worth—get this—as much as $100 million. His old company paid him $18 million last year—while he was in jail—and may have made another $86 million when the company was sold. He lives in a $2.4 million mansion in Las Vegas (an interesting place from which to run for a West Virginia Senate seat) that has an infinity pool and a sculpture of three prancing dolphins. It’ll all make a great backdrop for the TV show that TLC will give him someday.Meanwhile, down in the hollers, the only infinity pools are the bets being placed on when the economy might ever be good again. Along with the rest of the country, the state’s unemployment rate went down from the post-great recession peak of 2010; but in the last year, it’s ticked back up, from a May 2017 low of 4.5 percent to March’s 5.4 percent. And coalfield employment, which Donald Trump was going to fix single-handedly because it was all Obama’s fault, isn’t much to brag about.In fairness, it’s up by about 1,400 nationally since Trump took office, from 50,7000 to 52,100. But that is way down from where it used to be. When Obama became president, mining employment was 86,400. It stayed in the 80’s until the fall of 2012 when it started sliding, mostly because of the competition from cheaper and cleaner natural gas. In West Virginia, they love to blame Obama and the Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan didn’t even kick in until late 2015. Of the 30,000 coal mining jobs lost nationally since 2012, two-thirds of them were lost before late 2015. But of course, nobody’s going to get anywhere in West Virginia politics these days talking like that.It’s a sad situation. I was in Charleston, the capital city in the southern part of the state, in February. My friend parked his SUV in the garage behind the downtown hotel we stayed in. By the next morning, someone had broken into it. We called the cops. Happens all the time, they said. Somebody looking for something they could sell fast.

 {'title': 'Praise the Outcome of Trump’s TPP Flip. Not the Process.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Thanks to the prodding of Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE), President Donald Trump has ordered economic advisor Larry Kudlow and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to look into possibly re-joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). “The president multiple times reaffirmed in general to all of us and looked right at Larry Kudlow and said, ‘Larry, go get it done,\'” Sasse said on Thursday. “If that happens, that’s huge news.”Trump’s newfound openness is unusual, inasmuch as he previously called TPP a “disaster.” What is more, the arguments for joining the TPP have always been buttressed by the premise that refusing to join the agreement would only help China. As I wrote in February of 2017, “In the case of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), America’s abandonment of the deal only\xa0opens the door for China to fill the vacuum.”It’s unclear why Trump is open to re-entering TPP now. Maybe the addition of free trader (and anti-tariff, free market conservative) Larry Kudlow to his economic team has something to do with it. Maybe it was that he met with a number of lawmakers who pleaded with him to reconsider his posture. Or maybe it was Ben Sasse’s \xa0persuasion specifically that did the trick. This does seem to have been an impetus—a fact that critics of Trump’s Republican “enablers” should consider when criticizing them for not calling him a fascist and throwing a drink in his face as they storm out of the White House, vowing to impeach him at the first chance they get, and thereby abandoning the possibility of ever whispering sweet free market nothings in his ear. \xa0Then again, it could simply be that Trump realized that, while pleasing his supporters in the rust belt, a trade war with China would alienate Trump fans in America’s breadbasket. This is the most nakedly cynical explanation, and one would normally be inclined to assume it is the answer. But Trump isn’t a normal politician, and attempting to get inside his head is a difficult, if disturbing, exercise. Bemoaning the trade imbalance was politically savvy while on the campaign trail, inasmuch as it allowed Trump to play populist demagogue and pander to the Rust Belt. But it never made much sense from a policy standpoint (as others pointed out, nations like Canada import way more steel to America than China). With mid-west farmers up in arms over China’s threats of retaliation, however, the political benefits of protectionism evaporated. Enter Sasse, with a way to keep China in check and keep the agricultural community inside the tent. Now, one could scold Trump for being on the wrong side of the issue from day one, or for changing his mind based on politics, not principle. But in the immortal words of John Goodman in Raising Arizona, “I’d rather light a candle than curse [his] darkness.”There was a time when a foolish consistency meant a lot to me. Today, I’m content with converts. It’s hip to flip—so long as it’s in the right direction. And make no mistake, this is in the right direction if we actually want to stand up to China in a way that won’t cut off our own nose to spite our face. Beijing prefers a bipolar dynamic, which is why re-engaging in the Pacific makes perfect sense. It would isolate China, opening the door for us to find new trade partners. (And, ideally, a multilateral strategy would involve re-engagement on TPP, as well as cyber doctrines to combat China’s intellectual property theft. For more on this, I highly recommend Jonah Goldberg’s recent podcast discussion with Ben Sasse.)

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Now, before I go any further, a disclaimer is in order. Dealing with Donald Trump is, it has been said, like “negotiating with Jell-O.” And as the New York Times’ Jonathan Martin cautions, Trump’s TPP comments “recall his gun control comments: telling present audience what they want to hear, prompting said audience to wishcast comments as policy rather than a momentary riff.”What is more, it’s important to stress a caveat: Trump didn’t say he would re-enter TPP, just that he was open to looking at it. It’s entirely possible that tomorrow morning, we will awaken to Trump tweeting that he will never rejoin “that horrible one-sided globalist TPP scheme. Very bad. Not smart.” \xa0Then again, Trump might actually stick with it. Indeed, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters put out a statement on Thursday afternoon, which could allow Trump to flip-flop on TPP and save face at the same time: "Last year, the President kept his promise to end the TPP deal negotiated by the Obama Administration because it was unfair to American workers and farmers,” she wrote. “The President has consistently said he would be open to a substantially better deal, including in his speech in Davos earlier this year. To that end, he has asked Amb. Lighthizer and Director Kudlow to take another look at whether or not a better deal could be negotiated.”In other words, Trump isn’t changing his mind or backtracking—he’s negotiating a better deal. Whatever gets him through the night.How do we make sense of any of this, considering all the back and forths? I’m not sure we can. Trump might reverse course tomorrow. It could happen on a whim, or it could happen because of something that Sean Hannity says. Maybe Breitbart will write something dumb? Or he will see a Laura Ingraham tweet? All we can do is encourage good behavior and call out bad behavior. And for today, at least, Donald Trump finds himself coming down on the right side of a hugely important issue. When this happens, we should say so. He’s right today. In 2018, who could ask for anything more?'},
 {'title': '‘Chappaquiddick’ and the Original Sin of Tribal Politics',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Donald Trump once infamously remarked while running for president, "I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\'t lose voters." Though he\'s certainly not clever enough or historically astute to have known it, Trump was on to something. Just look at Chappaquiddick. Though the word was once a ubiquitous reference in American politics, it barely registers anymore. That may change — for at least a brief interlude — thanks to the release later this week of Chappaquiddick, a narrative feature film depicting the July 1969 incident where then-Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) drove his car off a bridge in Martha\'s Vineyard after a night of drinking, leaving Mary Jo Kopechne — a former aide to his late brother, Bobby — to die as he spent over nine hours concocting an alibi. As the film depicts in horrifying detail — and as subsequent investigations far more thorough and competent than the one performed in the immediate aftermath by the Edgartown Police Department made clear — Kopechne died of suffocation, not drowning. The prevailing theory is that Kopechne was conscious and straining upward in the overturned car, gasping for hours in a pocket of air while trapped in the otherwise water-filled Oldsmobile. Had Kennedy exhibited slightly more concern for human life than his own political future, and notified first responders within the first few hours after the accident, the 28-year-old Kopechne likely would have been saved. In Chappaquidick, Kennedy (played by Jason Clarke) is portrayed as self-pitying and manipulative, and at the same time infuriatingly entitled and easily manipulated. He vacillates between indulging a craven instinct to save his own skin and yearning for an opportunity to make penance and earn redemption. Ultimately, the film\'s true theme reveals itself not as the Passion of Ted Kennedy, but the irresistible draw of tribalism.A key plot point centers on the last surviving second-generation Kennedy belatedly steeling himself to do the right thing and make a confession with some semblance of truth to it, only to be thwarted by his domineering father, Joseph, Sr. — still plotting for another Kennedy in the White House — who plops his youngest son in a room with a who\'s who of the 1960s Democratic Party\'s heaviest hitters — fixers, lawyers, even former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Much of the film\'s second act is built around this brain trust\'s efforts to "frame the conversation," and in a rare moment where Kennedy exhibits a modicum of self-awareness at Kopechne\'s funeral, one of her closest friends rallies behind Kennedy, imploring him to not abandon his political future. Only a close Kennedy cousin serves as the film\'s conscience — consistently standing up against Teddy\'s deception and cowardice — and his reward is to be increasingly marginalized out of the tribe.\xa0The film climaxes with the senator making a televised "confession." Though his prepared speech was self-serving to the point of absurdity, pockmarked with lies and omissions, and even included a reference to a mythical "Kennedy curse" — a montage of\xa0real news footage from 1969 of on-the-street interviews with Massachusetts voters provides the verdict to Kennedy\'s trial of public opinion. Most of the interviewees are overwhelmingly sympathetic, and even the ones who think Kennedy was wrong — as in, guilty-of-manslaughter wrong — still say they\'d vote for him.\xa0That\'s the unspoken lesson of Chappaquiddick. In a country with only two substantial political tribes, there is almost no transgression committed by a "leader" that can\'t be morally compartmentalized, and while most private citizens would be in prison for what Kennedy did, tribalism was his route to a legacy as "the lion of the Senate," where he was elected to serve nine terms before his death in 2009. \xa0Nearly a half-century after the deadly incident, Kennedy tribalists chafe at the mere mention of Chappaquiddick as an affront to the Ted Kennedy legacy that they believe should be held as sacrosanct. MSBNC\'s Chris Matthews has been known to get his dander up when a Republican makes a Chappaquiddick reference during a TV appearance, and in the pages of The Daily Beast, Matthews once tried to spin Kopechne\'s death as the inspiration for Kennedy\'s advocacy for health care reform. Even Chappaquiddick director John Curran has inexplicably said he wouldn\'t have made this movie were Kennedy still alive. Tribalism is why it took over two decades for Democrats to come around to the fact that the Bill Clinton\'s sexual transgressions were more than just grist for puritanical Republican outrage, but that his abuse of presidential power to silence and shame Monica Lewinsky should have cost him the presidency. Republicans, for their part, would be delusional to think they are above such blind tribalism. After impeaching Clinton, the party of small government and family values nominated and elected Donald Trump — the serially adulterous, pussy-grabbing, crony capitalist with career-long mob ties. As an encore, Alabama Republicans nominated Judge Roy Moore, and though he ultimately lost his special election for Senate, he did so with the backing of the Republican National Committee and the President of the United States after multiple credible allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and sexual relationships with minors were made public. \xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

What remains totally possible, and indeed probable, is the political survival of a powerful man implicated in unforgivable acts. People need to believe in "leaders" to provide the tribe with purpose, and thanks to the timeless bipartisan scourge of the soul that is blind tribalism, the myth of the leader becomes more important than basic human morality.

 {'title': 'Boozing, Pill-Pushing Allegations Bring Down Trump Veterans Affairs Pick Ronny Jackson',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Ronny Jackson, White House physician to three presidents and Donald Trump’s spur-of-the-moment nominee to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, has withdrawn his nomination to run the federal government’s second-largest department after allegations surfaced of harassment, hostile workplace behavior, and excessive drinking on the job.“Going into this process, I expected tough questions about how to best care for our veterans, but I did not expect to have to dignify baseless and anonymous attacks on my character and integrity,” Jackson, a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy and an Iraq War veteran, said in a statement. “The allegations against me are completely false and fabricated.” “While I will forever be grateful for the trust and confidence President Trump has placed in me by giving me this opportunity, I am regretfully withdrawing my nomination to be Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs,” he said. Jackson, who won Trump’s personal approval after telling reporters that the president could live to be 200 years old with a better diet, already faced stiff headwinds at the outset of his nomination to succeed fired VA Secretary David Shulkin. The physician had no managerial experience beyond running the White House medical staff, and key congressional leaders told The Daily Beast that they were unfamiliar with Jackson and his views on veterans’ care.“I have very serious questions that need to be addressed, and they should be addressed right now. Like today,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a senior member of the committee, told The Daily Beast, adding that the White House “has been really careless, maybe even negligent about vetting with a number of these nominations.”But the dam truly broke after detailed allegations were made regarding Jackson’s behavior in the Navy and at the White House, ranging from hostility to co-workers and subordinates, alcohol use on the job, and over-prescription of medications. \xa0On Wednesday evening, Democrats from the Veterans Affairs Committee released a two-page list of allegations made by 23 current and former colleagues of Jackson that ranged from improperly prescribing opioids to a staff member to crashing a government vehicle while intoxicated. Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), the ranking member of the committee, said Jackson was dubbed “the Candyman” because he “handed out prescription drugs like they were candy.”In an interview on Fox & Friends Thursday morning, President Trump blamed Tester for Jackson’s downfall. “These are false accusations. They’re trying to destroy a man. For Tester to bring up ‘Candyman,’ there’s no proof of this,” Trump said. “He’s got this beautiful record, unblemished. [Tester] will pay a big price in Montana. The admiral is the kind of person they respect and admire.”Initially, the White House moved to defend Jackson, who was not vetted or interviewed before President Trump tweeted out his nomination to head Veterans Affairs on March 28. After the Senate’s veterans’ panel officially delayed Jackson’s confirmation hearings, senior administration official told reporters Tuesday that the allegations against Jackson were being driven by disgruntled former employees, and pointed out that a Controlled Substance Inventory Board audit of the White House medical team “confirms Dr. Jackson’s medicinal prescriptions were completely appropriate.”“He has improved unit morale, received glowing reviews and promotions under Republican and Democrat presidents, and has been given a clean vet from the FBI,” the official said. “He has never even been the subject of an inspector-general review and he will certainly not be railroaded by a bitter ex-colleague who was removed from his job.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Citing two sources, CNN reported that the employee was “uncomfortable” with Jackson’s behavior."},
 {'title': 'Teen Got Feds to OK His ‘Blaze It for Jill Stein’ PAC',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "With little fanfare, federal regulators took steps two weeks ago to kill a super PAC supporting former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. The Federal Election Commission’s letter of “administrative termination”—the formal process by which it shuts down a group’s operations—received no media attention whatsoever. That’s because the super PAC was a joke. Perhaps the name gave it away. “Blaze It for Delegate Jill Stein” didn’t spend a single cent during the 2016 election. If that wasn’t proof of its less-than-serious intentions, consider its origins. On September 30, 2016, Charlie Baker of South Orange, New Jersey, took out a piece of lined paper, with hole punches in it, and wrote a handwritten application to form the committee. He was 14-years-old, in the middle of an 8th grade social studies in which the teacher had divided students into camps representing various presidential candidates. His was the Jill Stein camp, an inglorious designation because, as he put it, “I did not support her candidacy at all.” But school is school and sometimes, for the sake of the grade, you gotta do things that aren’t all too gratifying. One day, the teacher encouraged students to be creative in their advocacy and Baker, after giving it some thought, decided that a super PAC—which could raise and spend unlimited money on behalf of a candidate so long as they don’t directly coordinate with the campaign—would do. The hurdles proved shockingly easy to clear. He went online and found an actual standardized application letter to get such a group started. He then wrote the FEC, eschewing a computer because, as he recalled, “I was at school and couldn’t actually print it out.” In his letter, Baker pledged to not use any funds “to make contributions whether direct, in-kind, or via coordinated communications to federal candidates and committees.” He listed himself as both the custodian of records and the treasurer of the super PAC. But, for a flourish, he marked down his title as “Supreme Trap Lord.” His friend, Alex Klint, was listed as the “designated agent” with the title of “Elf Lord.” In less than a week, their super PAC was approved. “Part of the idea to creating these insane titles is to see how far we can go and still be accepted as a super PAC,” Baker said. “The idea was, it is ridiculously easy to make a super PAC. And it was ridiculously easy. In fact, it is kind of insane how easy it is because it provides such an easy vehicle for be corrupt in the system.” The super PAC made absolutely zero efforts to help elect Stein, saving a perfunctory attempt at fundraising during which Baker went around with a glass jar and asked classmates for loose change. “No one donated to it,” he said. Baker followed the election but couldn’t vote, being 14 and all. He said that if he could he would have “begrudgingly” backed Hillary Clinton.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.On December 20, 2016, the FEC wrote Baker, alerting him that his “committee failed to designate a campaign depository.” In other words, it wasn’t revealing what political activities it was spending money on, which made sense because it wasn’t spending any money at all. Baker ignored the email. The FEC followed up on December 28 and then February 16, 2018. Having received no responses to any of those communiques, the FEC wrote Baker again on April 6, this time with a more dire tone. “[T]he Commission intends to administratively terminate your committee,” the letter read. “As such, your committee is no longer obligated to file reports. However, any receipt or disbursement of funds by the committee for the purpose of influencing a Federal election or supporting a federal candidate will void the administrative termination.”By that point, however, Baker had checked out of the super PAC game entirely. He'd gotten a 94 in the class and was unaware that “Blaze It for Delegate Jill Stein” was in danger of being killed off. Frankly, he could not have cared less. “We didn’t do anything with it,” he conceded. “But the craziest thing is we could of. The FEC had absolutely no problem approving this super PAC that we wrote out on lined pieces of paper and that was formed by a bunch of 14-year-olds. There is a problem here.” "},
 {'title': 'The Story Behind Trump’s Infamous ‘Best Sex I Ever Had’ Headline',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Of all the column inches dedicated to Donald Trump over the past decades—so many that they’re best measured in units of length longer than the height of Trump Tower—one headline stands above all others in the memory: the 1990 New York Post front page with the now-president’s second wife claiming he’s the “best sex I’ve ever had,” next to a photo of his beaming, proud face.A former New York Post journalist, Jill Brooke, spilled the beans Thursday about how one of the most famous tabloid headlines in U.S. history came to be—and the backstory is just as ridiculous as you imagined.In a column for The Hollywood Reporter about her run-ins with Trump and his three wives as a New York Post journalist over the years, Brooke recounted when Trump was going through a divorce with first wife, Ivana, who was winning the PR war against him, much to his chagrin.One day, angered by a particularly sympathetic New York Daily News front-page story on Ivana, the aggrieved real estate mogul called the New York Post office. “Those fucking bitches,” Trump allegedly bellowed over the speakerphone in Post editor Jerry Nachman’s office, referring to rival Daily News: “I want a front-page story tomorrow.”Nachman, a wily veteran, explained to the future president that you can’t just demand a front-page report whenever you want one—there has to be a story to go alongside it. When Trump asked what would warrant a front page, Brooke recalled how the New York Post editor explained further that it would usually be something to do with “murder, money or sex.”Brooke remembered Trump immediately snapping back: “Marla says with me it’s the best sex she’s ever had,” and Nachman, already picturing his perfect headline, said that would make a great story if Trump could provide some form of corroboration. According to Brooke, Trump then shouted to the nearby Marla Maples: “Didn’t you say it’s the best sex you ever had with me?”A faint “yes, Donald,” was heard in the background and the headline wrote itself to become part of history.Brooke said it was only later she discovered Trump was prone to impersonating associates on the phone, and so she is now unsure if Trump’s second wife ever said any such thing.Whether or not it was true, Brooke wrote: “The Post scored with that headline. So did Trump in the PR war. Shameless and wily, he instinctively knew even then how to steer the media conversation.”Maples has previously denied that she said the infamous words in the headline, which lends weight to Brooke’s suspicion that Trump may have actually impersonated his second wife. Speaking about it this February, Maples said: “I never said that, someone else said that. Is it true? I’m not going to talk about that. The truth will come out, just not here.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

That was pretty awful at the time. Now it’s funny to look back on, but at the time it was so humiliating!”If Trump did impersonate his second wife, it wouldn’t be the first time he’s pretended to be someone close to him. In 2016, The Washington Post uncovered a recording from 1991 in which Trump appeared to pose as his own spokesperson. The newspaper also reported a publicist calling himself “John Miller” or “John Barron” was known to call journalists from Trump’s office during the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s—and sounded suspiciously like the man himself.Asked about the impersonations, Trump denied it, saying: “I don’t know anything about it. You’re telling me about it for the first time, and it doesn’t sound like my voice at all. I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice. You can imagine that. This sounds like one of the scams, one of the many scams. Doesn’t sound like me.”However, a voice analyst insisted it was Trump all along."},
 {'title': 'Zuckerberg Gets More Questions About Diamond & Silk Than Facebook’s Role in Myanmar Genocide',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Capitol Hill this week, he was bound to face a variety of difficult questions ranging from his company’s handling of user information to the proliferation of fake news over its pages. For Republican lawmakers, however, the presence of the enigmatic CEO has provided them the opportunity to press on a separate, though related, matter: the treatment of a pro-Trump YouTube duo.During the course of two days, at least four lawmakers have quizzed Zuckerberg over reports that Facebook flagged the content of Diamond & Silk as “unsafe to the community.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) started it off by alleging that conservative American voices have been silenced by Facebook’s content screeners and specifically cited Diamond & Silk, the flamboyant Trump boosters who began their career as a YouTube video duo and have since become Fox News regulars with President Trump’s ear. (One senior administration official told The Daily Beast that the devoted duo have such a close relationship with Trump that they practically serve as “senior economic advisers.”)The pro-Trump duo recently claimed that Facebook blocked some of their content because it was deemed “unsafe to the community.” A rep for the site confirmed this week that they were "reaching out to the creators of Diamond and Silk to try to resolve this matter."“This is actually a concern that I have… making sure that we don’t have any bias in the work that we do,” Zuckerberg told Cruz. “I think it is a fair concern.”Zuckerberg’s answers on Tuesday apparently did not suffice because during Wednesday’s hearing on the House side, he was peppered with a handful more Diamond & Silk-related questions.“Why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond & Silk?” Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) breathlessly asked. “That is ludicrous. They hold conservative views. That isn\'t ‘unsafe.’”“In that specific case, our team made an enforcement error and we have already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,” Zuckerberg asserted.Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) then set Zuck up for yet another Diamond & Silk-related dig. “Do you subjectively manipulate your algorithms to prioritize or censor speech?” she asked. “There are types of content like terrorism that I think we all agree we do not want to have on our service,” Zuckerberg replied. “So we build systems that can identify those and can remove that content and we’re very proud of that work.”“Let me tell you something right now,” Blackburn snarked in response. “Diamond & Silk is not terrorism.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Were the people who made that mistake held accountable in any way?” the Louisiana Republican asked.“Congressman, let me follow up with you on that,” a stoic Zuckerberg responded. “That situation developed while I was here preparing to testify, so I’m not—I don’t know the details of it.”Facebook’s treatment of Diamond & Silk gets to a larger issue of whether the private company views itself as an open platform for political content of any stripe, or whether it feels it can and should apply editorial controls. But the sheer number of specific questions about the pro-Trump pair was a remarkable illustration of how congressional hearings almost always devolve into partisan politics. Later in the hour, Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) brought out a poster with Diamond & Silk’s picture, and read to Zuckerberg a question submitted directly by the duo. “What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?” was their question.While lawmakers obsessed over Diamond & Silk, they almost completely ignored Facebook’s role in Myanmar’s ongoing genocide. United Nations human-rights experts investigating what has been described as the “ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya people stated last week that the social-media platform is to blame for the rapid spread of propaganda and hate speech against the stateless minority. Additionally, The Daily Beast reported last year, Rohingya activists found their posts documenting the genocide mysteriously disappearing from Facebook.The only mention of this connection came Tuesday during the joint Senate commerce and judiciary committees hearing with Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. During his allotted time, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) repeatedly pressed the social-media titan on the matter, citing specific examples of violent propaganda that fell through Facebook’s content-screening cracks.“What’s happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more,” Zuckerberg pledged. “We need to ramp up our effort there dramatically.” He vowed to hire more Burmese-speaking employees to help filter out the violence-flaming content.As of press time, not a single member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked Zuckerberg about his site’s role in aiding genocide abroad.--'},
 {'title': 'It’s ‘Punish a Muslim Day.’ Or, as We Muslims Call It, Every Day.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A few weeks ago when I first heard about “Punish a Muslim” day slated for Tuesday, April 3—today, that is—I dismissed it as a stupid prank by some right-wing idiots. And if you saw the simplistic flier sent to various mosques in the United Kingdom, you would’ve likely shared my feelings. But as the day approached, it was clear that this was not a joke. While the flier is simple in design, its purpose is sinister. It promises “points” to those who attack Muslims, ranging from 10 points for verbal abuse of a Muslim to 100 points for beating up a Muslim to 1,000 for fire-bombing a mosque. It has fulfilled its intended goal of terrorizing Muslims, and not just in the United Kingdom but in the United States as well. In the U.K., Muslim women have been warned to hide their hijabs or not pick up their kids alone from school, as fear has swept through the community. And in the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations has reported receiving concerned calls from Muslim Americans about the day. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee’s Abed Ayoub is encouraging people to remain vigilant and “if you feel you’re in danger, call law enforcement immediately.” And in Vermont, the Muslim community was are so on edge that local officials publicly went on record vowing to protect them. But let me be blunt. If April 3 was the only day that Muslims in America had to worry about being “punished,” I would be overjoyed. The Daily Show’s Hasan Minhaj put it perfectly on the Comedy Central show last week while addressing “Punish a Muslim” day. Minhaj joked about telling fellow Muslims: “On April 3 we all stay home. Amazon Prime everything we need. Catch up on Peaky Blinders [a Netflix series]. Then walk out April 4 and boom! Islamophobia is over!” I wish that were the case.The reality, however, is far different. To varying degrees, every day is “punish a Muslim” day in Donald Trump’s America. Trump is a man who openly trafficked in anti-Muslim hate to win the GOP nomination and the White House with his call for a total and complete shutdown on Muslims coming into the United States and his irresponsible but clearly calculated comment “Islam hates us.” Trump also ginned up fears that Muslim refugees were coming to America as a “great Trojan horse” to destroy our nation. As president, Trump has continued with his demonization of Muslims. He has repeatedly tried to impose a limited Muslim ban. And in November, Trump retweeted to his millions of followers three videos that were designed by a far right anti-Muslim group based in the United Kingdom to inflame hate against Muslims. Trump’s words and actions have truly helped make every day “punish a Muslim” day. We have witnessed a bone-chilling increase in hate crimes against Muslims since Trump began his campaign. In 2016 alone there was a documented spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes to levels that surpassed what we saw in the year after 9/11. Think about that for a moment: There were more hate crimes against Muslim Americans in terms of physical assaults during Trump’s run for president than after a terror attack involving Muslims that took nearly 3,000 lives. And in the first few months of 2017, we saw again a startling increase in the number of anti-Muslim bias incidents as documented by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. These events range from harassment to job discrimination claims to assaults. You know what, if you truly want to see what “punish a Muslim” day looks like, just check out the Muslim Advocates interactive map that documents a range of attacks against Muslim Americans over the past two years. A few examples include in May 2017, when a Muslim American-owned convenience store was set on fire in Mathis, Texas, after receiving threats: “You are Muslim, we are going to burn your store.” In February 2017, two mosques in Alabama received emails warning that Muslims “will be hunted nationwide” until all are killed or have left the country. And last April in Jacksonville, Florida, a 52-year-old white man threatened his Muslim neighbors by pointing a gun at the head of the father in front of his wife and kids, yelling: “I’m going to kill all you Muslim [expletive], get out of my country.” And that is just a fraction of the incidents documented by Muslim Advocates. Sure, there were anti-Muslim hate crimes before Trump. But Trump’s demonization of Muslims is like nothing we ever saw before by a major party-political candidate, and that is a big part of the reason for the spike. And beyond these hate crimes, the sense of an almost daily “punish a Muslim” day in America comes from the growing trend we see from the media normalizing or ignoring anti-Muslim hate. For example, there’s a major federal terrorism trial going on right now in Kansas. Why haven’t you heard about it? Simple: The terrorists are not Muslims. Rather, they are Trump supporting white supremacists who plotted to kill American Muslims. But the mainstream media simply doesn’t cover these trials with the same intensity as when a Muslim is a defendant. Even in entertainment media we are seeing a normalization of anti-Muslim hate. Roseanne Barr has a documented history of spewing anti-Muslim bigotry (as well attacks on other communities), from retweeting claims that Islam is the same as Nazism to her ginning up fear of Muslims by tweeting about “Islamic rape pedo culture.” Yet ABC rebooted her TV show and has refused to denounce or even comment on her history of anti-Muslim hate.

The result, however, is that the Muslim American community is more resilient than ever, with our community thriving and growing through it all. \xa0And while there are real safety concerns over “punish a Muslim” day, many Muslim Americans, together with their allies, responded today defiantly with #LoveAMuslim which has been trending on Twitter all day and shows support for Muslims. That response won’t change the minds of Trump and other anti-Muslim bigots, but it does send them a clear message that despite their efforts to “punish” us, we aren’t going anywhere."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has come under fire by President Trump and Republican lawmakers, responded on Tuesday to the conservative House Freedom Caucus drafting articles of impeachment against him by warning that he will not be extorted.The caucus move represented increasing tension between the Department of Justice and conservative lawmakers about the scope and continuity of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump and Russian officials during the presidential campaign. “They can’t even resist leaking their own drafts,” Rosenstein said at an event at the Newseum on Tuesday afternoon. “I just don’t have anything to say about documents like that, that nobody has the courage to put their name on and that they leak in that way.”He also said: “I can tell you that there have been people that have been making threats against me privately and publicly for some time, and I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.”The Washington Post reported that the draft articles, which had been referred to as a "last resort," were created after members have been attempting to get documents from the Department of Justice about FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign as well as information about the probe into Hillary Clinton\'s email server. “My frustrations about their inability to respond to simple requests could warrant further action,” Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) told the Post. A spokesperson for the caucus did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast about Rosenstein\'s remarks. Rosenstein also specifically addressed the caucus\' concern about obtaining a FISA warrant. "There\'s\xa0a lot of\xa0talk about FISA application and many of the people I\xa0see talking about it seem not to\xa0recognize what it is. A FISA application is actually a warrant, just like a search warrant," Rosenstein said. "In order to get a FISA search warrant, you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that\xa0the information in the affidavit is true and correct to the best of knowledge and belief. And that is the way we operate, and if that is wrong, sometimes there is, if you find there is anything incorrect in there, that person is going to face consequences." '},

  'body': "“Whoever commits an offense against the U.S. or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.”\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa018 U.S.C. 2Legal and linguistic experts have been debating who may have been guilty of criminal wrongdoing arising out of, ironically, the emails, tweets, and blocked phone calls of Donald Trump, his family and staff. Was it collusion—per Webster, a “secret agreement between two or more persons for a fraudulent or deceitful purpose”? Or perhaps conspiracy—defined in legal texts as two or more people agreeing to commit a criminal act when there is an overt act in furtherance of that agreement, not necessarily completion of the crime envisioned—is closer. If the Russians were guilty of conspiring to commit specific crimes, how might the president’s aides and boosters also be?When I was an organized-crime prosecutor in Robert F. Kennedy’s Justice Department, I tried a criminal case that ultimately went to the Supreme Court, and its ruling sheds light on the current debate regarding these meetings between Donald Trump and others, and with the Russians. The ruling deals with the second section of the federal criminal code noted above—not some exotic or vaguely defined crime.I am reminded of that notorious case I tried, and retried, the ultimate conviction upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, because it is relevant to the present debate about collusion v. conspiracy.\xa0In U.S. v. Lester,\xa0et.al., the government indicted three police officials, two gambling operators, and a lawyer under the civil rights law (18 USC 242) for depriving citizens of their civil rights when acting under color of law. The case involved a conspiracy to falsely arrest and disgrace George Ratterman, a former football star running for sheriff of Newport, Kentucky, then described as a corrupt “sin city.” Ratterman was running to clean up the town, and the defendants tried to frame him in a compromising act with a stripper. Our first trial ended in a hung jury. I retried it, and we convicted the lawyer and one of the gambling characters. The jury acquitted the other casino operator (later convicted of another crime) and the three policemen. The case was appealed on the theory that the two who were convicted weren’t and couldn’t be acting under color of law; that standard could only be applied against the three acquitted policemen. Interesting theory.In 1966, the federal appellate court upheld the conviction of the two men found guilty. But here’s the interesting part. It noted in passing that the evidence was sufficient to convict all six. The Sixth Circuit ruled that the two appellants were guilty of aiding and abetting the three police officers. The two convicted defendants could be guilty of aiding and abetting a conspiracy, even if they could not commit the substantive civil rights offense that was the object of the conspiracy.The appellate court ruled that under 18 USC 2, which by the way is still law, whoever “aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.” If he “causes an act to be done by him or another,” that would be an offense against the United States, and he would be punishable as a principal. Ignorance of the law, as all know, is no defense. Nor is the incompletion of any planned conspiracy. To quote the court:“…even though a defendant was incompetent to commit the offense as principal by reason of not being of a particular age, sex, condition, or class, he may, nevertheless, be punished as a procurer or abettor.”A recent\xa0Politico\xa0survey of law professors offered a list of crimes that\xa0might\xa0result from facts already made public about Russia’s involvement in the 2016 election: violations of election and campaign financing laws, foreign intelligence activities or cybersecurity prevention laws, wire fraud, something we lawyers call misprison of a felony, false filings and false statements to government officials, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, perjury.Might the Lester precedent apply to the acts of Donald Trump or Donald Trump, Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, their consorting lawyers and staffers in the private sector, the campaign, or the government? If the Russians violated any of the laws, might these Americans—possibly the president—have aided and abetted them?Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Might the current, up to the moment, “breaking news” controversy be the latest and most profound application of the Lester case ruling? Depending on what the special prosecutor already knows and the facts and evidence he develops, my old case just might come back to life.That case was notorious and exciting when we tried it. RFK called and found me and the FBI agent I worked with at the small restaurant in Newport, Kentucky, where we were having our modest celebratory lunch to congratulate us. Now half a century later, might this case turn out to be the precedent to bring down a president?Ronald Goldfarb is a Washington, D.C., attorney and author who served in the RFK Department of Justice."},

 {'title': 'The State Where Your Second Choice Could Actually Win',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'In a little-noticed victory, Maine appears ready to move forward with innovative election reform—even as its politicians are dragged there kicking and screaming.In 2016, the state’s voters enacted something called ranked choice voting. It is a radical rewrite of how elections happen, backed by voters after both Democratic and Republican legislators had refused to act. Heartwarming, yes? Unfortunately, after a state Supreme Court ruling, Republicans moved to block the reform from taking effect. They had quiet help from some Democratic officials as well. So voters turned to something called a “people’s veto”—in this case, a veto of a move to effectively veto the citizens referendum. On June 12, Maine will hold statewide primaries for governor and other offices using the new system. At the same time, voters will decide whether to move forward with the reform altogether. After a legal tangle, the secretary of state just published the new innovative ballots. It will either be a glorious reaffirmation of the people’s power to rule, or a fiasco. What’s at stake? In nearly all the United States, elections can be won by plurality, not a majority—and even if most people can’t stand the winner. We all tend to assume this is the only way to stage an election. In Maine, where there is an unusually strong tradition of independent candidates, eight out of the last ten governors were elected without a majority. Ranked choice voting aims to solve this by letting voters indicate who their second choice is, and their third choice as well. Candidate Smith gets my number one vote. But candidate Jones gets my number two vote. Another gets my number three vote. Others get none at all. If one of the candidates wins a majority among the number one votes, election over. If not, officials add the second choice votes, and if necessary the third choice votes, until there is a majority. So a candidate with broad second place support can prevail. A version of this is used to pick sports MVPs and by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as in, “I’d like to thank the Academy”), and in cities such as Minneapolis and San Fancisco.Got all that? Let me confess: I work on democracy reform and constitutional law every day. I’ve always had a hard time fully understanding ranked choice voting, let alone being able to explain it. I always thought it was too complicated for voters to understand. Isn’t it hard enough to get voters to the polls without adding more math? But maybe that’s wrong. Voters understood it enough to pass it by ballot measure. Some credit goes to the embarrassing two terms of Gov. Paul LePage, a rancorous Republican who narrowly won a GOP primary, then slipped into office in a three-way race. LePage’s cringeworthy antics make Donald Trump look dignified. He told the NAACP to “kiss my butt,” and said a legislative foe had “give[n] it to the people without Vaseline.” But more credit goes to a passionate citizens campaign ranging from the League of Women Voters to Nirvana bass player Krist Novoselic, who is, believe it or not, a major proponent of the reform nationwide. \xa0Proponents hope it can dampen negative campaigning and tip candidates toward appealing to a broader base. As we’re all too aware, typically a candidate can win with a fierce claque of supporters, despite opposition by most voters. But under the new system, if you attack opponents too harshly, you lose the chance to get second or third choice votes from their supporters. One Rutgers survey found that voters in cities that used the new method were unusually satisfied with the tenor of campaigns. \xa0So a lot is riding on the election in June. Recently Secretary of State Matt Dunlop published the ballots using the new rules, which seem clear enough. If Maine’s system is reaffirmed at the ballot box, and works well, we can expect it to spread to other states. It’s all part of a democracy reform wave cresting across the country. In Michigan and possibly other states including Utah, Colorado and Missouri, ballot measures would establish nonpartisan commissions for legislative redistricting. In Ohio, Governor Kasich has worked with reformers to push a similar plan. A Florida ballot measure would end the state’s lifetime ban on voting for people with a felony conviction, restoring the right to vote to over one million people. New Jersey just became the twelfth state to enact automatic voter registration, which would add millions to the rolls nationwide. Americans sense their democracy needs repair. Standing against that wave are politicians busily trying to entrench themselves. It’s brazen, to say the least, to snub the voters. Let’s hope Maine citizens do their duty and reaffirm their reform.

 {'title': 'Republican? Anti-Trump? Don’t Quit—Stay in the Party and Change It',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Ever since election night 2016, right-of-center Americans who did not vote for Donald Trump or who did so grudgingly have done battle with our partisan identities. Along the way, we’ve lost a few associates, but also been joined by fresh faces.\xa0The latest addition to this roster is James Comey, who recently said in an ABC News podcast that the GOP “has left [him]” and that he “can’t be associated with it.” He also said that “[Republicans] don’t represent anything I believe in... I see the Republican Party, as near as I can tell, reflects now entirely Donald Trump’s values. It doesn’t reflect values at all.”Comey has joined the ranks of those who publicly destroyed their GOP registration cards in the course of 2016, and figures like The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin, whom Politico has described as “a leading voice for a group of conservative intellectuals who don’t fit comfortably in either political party.” Many of these folks are friends and I sympathize with them. But I also deeply, deeply disagree with them. If you ever watched The West Wing, you may remember Matt Skinner. He’s the gay Republican congressman who makes two pointed comments that should be at the crux of every Trump-opposing or Trump-skeptical right-of-center individual’s thinking about party affiliation. The first is, “I agree with 95% of the Republican platform… My life doesn’t have to be about being a homosexual. It doesn’t have to be entirely about that.”\xa0The second is,\xa0“I never understood why you gun control people don’t all join the NRA. They’ve got two million members, you bring three million to the next meeting, call a vote. ‘All those in favor of tossing guns?’ Bam. Move on.”The point is this: A party is what you make it.Trump has made the GOP his by slapping an “R” on his chest and attracting like-minded people to it. And people who were Republicans long before he was have gone along for the ride. While under 40 percent of Americans approve of Trump, something like 80 percent of Republicans approve of him, according to\xa0Gallup. His opposition to free trade has succeeded in flipping Republican voters’ views of trade on their historical head. The congressional GOP, which many Trump-dissenting (former) Republicans hoped would act as a counterbalance to him, often instead acts as a pushover, doing his bidding. “Why should James Comey or Jennifer Rubin ditch a party they’ve belonged to for longer than he has?”And yet the wrong lessons are being taken away here. Rather than seeing permanence in the GOP’s Trumpite shift, people should see the reality that political parties change—a lot. Just as the Democratic Party isn’t the party of Bill Clinton, the GOP is not the party of Reagan, or Eisenhower, or Goldwater, or Rockefeller, or Compassionate Conservative Bush 43—and those Republican Parties often differed a great deal from the others, apart from on maybe two or three core items.Parties change. What the GOP is today under Trump is not likely to be what it is in even ten years. But that’s only the reality if people who want it to be something different in future stay in it, and work to change it from the inside. Instead, a whole bunch of them are taking a walk, goaded into doing so by people who rabidly disagree with them and know they’ll be in greater control, and more dominant, with the dissenters out in the wilderness, doing none of the things that actually get you power and influence in a political party.And let’s be clear: These people aren’t likely to find an actual home in the Democratic Party—which is very unlikely to embrace core right-of-center principles anytime soon, though of course these folks could engage with them and try, just as they could with the GOP. They’re also not likely to stand up a third party that can prove electorally competitive or functional anytime soon. If we’re doing a simple mathematical equation assessing where one can most efficiently effect change, the answer still remains the GOP—even if the odds look really slim.But there are ample precedents for engagement in the GOP yielding results critics. The most obvious one is the fight over LBGT rights.Back in 2006, nary a single elected Republican expressed support for ditching Don’t Ask Don’t Tell or recognizing same-sex marriage. But a big part of why Don’t Ask Don’t Tell died a death and freedom to marry became the law of the land was because Republicans moved on the issue—because grassroots pro-LGBT Republican activists like me didn’t walk away, we doubled down.

Before Don’t Ask Don’t Tell was overturned, you could find lots of Republicans, elected and not, who thought the policy was stupid. Today, we’re debating transgender troops and cake-baking. That is nothing short of a sea change, and proves that engagement works, whereas walking away is dicier. It also feels silly, when you consider how long many of those ditching the GOP have been a part of it, relative to newcomers like Trump. Why should Comey or Rubin ditch a party they’ve belonged to for longer than he has? He’s the newcomer. But at the end of the day, if enough people “drop out,” it really will become Trump’s party, and not just for the duration of his presidency.MSNBC host Chris Matthews is fond of saying that Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line. That’s what happened with Trump. Right up until when he locked down the nomination in the context of a quasi floor-fight at the 2016 convention, there was significant opposition to him. After that, Republicans mostly got on board, because it’s what we do.If #nevertrumpers, or Trump skeptics, want to change the GOP, we need to understand what Matthews already does, and engage, not walk away—even if doing so is painful and frustrating and maddening."},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Next Top Diplomat Can’t Save His Own Face',

  'body': "Most diplomats, when their old positions put their objectives at risk, look for opportunities to de-escalate conflict. Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, didn’t take the off-ramps that senators repeatedly offered him on Thursday.Pompeo was never going to have an easy confirmation hearing. As a Tea Party congressman before joining the administration, he had made bigoted statements about American Muslims. As Trump’s CIA director, Pompeo has used bellicose rhetoric against Iran and North Korea,\xa0to the delight of the White House, which has recently taken to purging national security officials Trump considered out of sync with his impulses.Bob Corker, the GOP chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Pompeo his colleagues were justified in wondering if his closeness with the president is “based on deferential willingness to go along to get along.” That kicked off five long and often agonizing hours in which Pompeo found himself caught between the president he seeks to please, the politician he used to be, and the senators he needs to convince. Several Democratic senators confronted Pompeo with his most disgraceful moment in office: a speech on the House floor laying collective responsibility for terrorism on American Muslims, delivered soon after the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. “The silence of Muslim leaders has been deafening,” Pompeo said in 2013. “Silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts.” Pompeo studiously ignored the numerous U.S. Muslim groups that condemned the attack without reservation—“We are all Bostonians -we mourn with the city,” read a Facebook post from the religious leader of Roxbury’s Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center—and instead thundered that “a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith… it casts doubt on the commitment to peace by adherents of the Muslim faith.”“Under pressure to account for his inflammatory speech, Pompeo did everything but apologize. He talked about his contacts ‘throughout a broad range of Muslim-majority countries,’ as if to say that some of his best allies are Muslims.”That speech was a critical moment in Pompeo’s political career. Prominent Islamophobes promoted the Kansas congressman, a relationship that has flowered ahead of his potential appointment as secretary of state. Frank Gaffney, who accused David Petraeus of “a kind of submission” to Sharia, boasted that Pompeo’s repeated appearances on his radio show “validate [Pompeo’s] fitness.” Brigitte Gabriel, who runs an organization that the Anti-Defamation League calls “the largest anti-Muslim group in the United States,” called him “a clear leader” in a statement blasted to reporters at the outset of Pompeo’s hearing. Under senatorial pressure to account for his inflammatory speech, Pompeo did everything but apologize—even when offered the explicit chance to do so. Pompeo talked about his intelligence contacts “throughout a broad range of Muslim-majority countries,” as if to say that some of his best intelligence allies are Muslims. He pretended that he was making the universalist statement that “each and every human being has an obligation to push back against this extremist use of violence,” despite having explicitly and uniquely singled out Muslims at the time for their alleged “special obligation” to do so.New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker left Pompeo dodging and stammering when he asked the CIA director if he had condemned Gaffney and Gabriel’s bigotry. “I would agree with you that silence in the face of injustice lends strength to that injustice,” Booker noted. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat with a chowder-thick accent, finally got Pompeo to concede, “it is true that many leaders spoke out about it,” but added, “I’m not sure we ever get to a point where it’s enough.”Markey asked Pompeo if he “apologized to the Boston Muslim leadership”—not even the entire “adherents of the Muslim faith” whose “commitment to peace” Pompeo doubted on the floor of the House of Representatives in 2013. “Senator, it was not my intention, in any respect to suggest that they were part of the chain of events that led to the attack,” Pompeo said. “The Boston Muslim community came out and condemned it,” Markey continued. “Is there any way in your mind they are complicit?”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Senator, to the extent they condemned the attacks, they did what it was that I think we all have the responsibility to do,” Pompeo said, eliding the fact that those condemnations came weeks before his attribution of collective responsibility. It was not the only moment that saw Pompeo tied into knots over his previous assertions. As a congressman, Pompeo built his foreign-policy profile thundering ceaselessly against Iran, and warning that the nuclear deal with Tehran was a disaster. A uranium-particle discovery in 2016 was “an extremely serious issue” revealing “the true nature of Iran’s program: to build a nuclear weapon.” But with Trump expected to rip up the deal in May, Pompeo on Thursday suddenly downplayed Iran’s commitment to a nuclear arsenal. If the U.S. walks away from the deal, Pompeo said, Iran wouldn’t build a bomb, since it’s “in their own economic self-interest” to stay in an accord that Washington will have torn up—despite having stated in 2015 that once the deal begins to formally expire years from now, it will “virtually guarante[e] that Iran will have the freedom to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons.” And despite in 2014 saying that the Iranian nuclear threat was so extreme as to justify a bombing campaign of “under 2,000 sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity,” Pompeo told GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, “Iran wasn’t racing to a weapon before the deal.” For good measure, Pompeo said he “absolutely not” is in favor of an attack on Iran, though he did not abandon his long-standing rejection of the Iran deal. “If the U.S. walks away from a nuclear deal, Pompeo said Thursday, Iran wouldn’t build a bomb. Back in 2015, he said the expiration of the deal would ‘virtually guarante[e] that Iran will have the freedom to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons.’”Flake pressed Pompeo on the implications of tearing up the Iran deal as Trump prepares a diplomatic parley with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, who, unlike Iran, already possesses a nuclear arsenal. Pompeo denied that the U.S. reneging on one deal would have any impact on Kim’s willingness to sign another. “The list of things he’s thinking about don’t include other deals throughout history,” Pompeo said.But Pompeo did tacitly recognize Pyongyang’s close attention to Washington’s proclamations, and issued a rare climbdown. Last summer, Pompeo told a security forum that he was “hopeful we will find a way to separate [Kim’s] regime from this system.” Ahead of the Trump-Kim meetings, Pompeo said he is “not advocating for regime change,” though he did not disavow his prior advocacy of exactly that. Doing so would likely undermine Trump and his supporters’ enthusiasm for Pompeo, the source of his current political power. But that tied Pompeo in knots as well. Pompeo insisted that the Trump administration had taken “real actions” to “reset the deterrence relationship with respect to Russia.” Confronted with statements from the National Security Agency director and the former national security adviser that Russian behavior remains aggressive, Pompeo later conceded, “Vladimir Putin has not yet received the message.” But Pompeo left little doubt of his determination to become secretary of state, an enormously powerful position and fourth in the constitutional line of succession to the presidency. He confirmed that he has been interviewed by Robert Mueller but obfuscated on what Trump discussed with him about then-FBI Director James Comey’s Russia investigation. After declaring his unwavering support for the rule of law, Pompeo was asked if he would resign in protest should Trump fire Mueller or Mueller’s functional boss, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.“My instincts tell me no,” he said, portraying himself as a steadfast force to protect the nation from foreign threats. “My instincts tell me that my obligation to continue to serve as America’s senior diplomat will be more important at times of political domestic turmoil.”"},

  'body': "On Wednesday evening, reality TV star Kim Kardashian visited former reality TV star and current president Donald Trump in the West Wing to plead the case and advocate for the pardon of Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother serving a life sentence for a drug conviction.Half a day later, Trump took action. Only, it wasn’t the 62-year-old cause célèbre of criminal justice reformers whom he helped out. Instead, the president pardoned a pro-Trump, right-wing conspiracy theorist and race-baiter, while suggesting he may soon do something similar for a fellow television personality, and a Democratic governor of Illinois convicted of corruption.The announcements, given with virtually no forewarning, underscored the extent to which the two main factors that have long motivated Trump—personal vindictiveness and a love of celebrity—have manifested themselves in presidential policy.“He has a gravitational pull towards [pardoning celebrities] because that is the world he used to exist in—a lot of those folks are people who used to be his friends,” Scottie Nell Hughes, a former top Trump ally and fixture on cable news, told The Daily Beast. “However, I believe this is opening a door, and if he doesn’t follow through with [more] people who are not well-known, I think that will be extremely disappointing.”Trump’s pardon of conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza and his floatation of one for Martha Stewart and a commutation for Rod Blagojevich appeared tied together by several threads. In each case, the beneficiaries and would-be beneficiaries were well-known figures with direct ties to Trump or his allies. In addition, each subject was prosecuted by a prominent legal or political enemy of the president.In D’Souza’s case, Trump’s ire appeared to be directed toward Preet Bharara, the former U.S. Attorney whose office secured the verdict and who was, in early 2017, fired by the president. But sources who spoke with Trump also noted that he didn’t just try to absolve a political ally and stick it to Bharara—he also had Rosie O’Donnell on his mind.D’Souza, whose wife credited Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for championing his cause to Trump, has compared his own case to a series of excessive campaign contributions made by O’Donnell. He couldn’t have chosen a more perfect foil. In the arena of Trump foes, few loom larger than Rosie. Last year, the president took another jab at her on Twitter, and has said in the past that he would “probably sue” her “because it would be fun [and] I'd like to take some money out of her fat-ass pockets.” Sure enough, sources say that in private conversations with those close to him, Trump has echoed D’Souza and others’ point, wondering why if “what Rosie did was so terrible,” she is a free woman and D’Souza was saddled with a criminal record, referencing what he had seen on TV.In fact, what O’Donnell did is routine. Political campaigns, including Trump’s, regularly refund excess contributions, which are minor civil infractions. It was also categorically different from D’Souza’s felonious effort to conceal excessive contributions to a U.S. Senate candidate in New York by reimbursing donations made in the name of an employee and a girlfriend. The candidate, longtime D’Souza friend Wendy Long, lost the general election by 43 percentage points.“I’ve always felt he was very unfairly treated,” \xa0Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday. “And a lot of people did, a lot of people did. What should have been a quick minor fine, like everybody else with the election stuff….what they did to him was horrible.” On that same plane ride, Trump also revealed that he was weighing a pardon for Stewart and a commutation for Blagojevich, two potential recipients with even more celebrity appeal. The former Illinois governor appeared on Trump’s NBC show Celebrity Apprentice, and Stewart had hosted her own failed spin-off of The Apprentice. And, like D’Souza, both also happen to have ties to Trump’s current bete noires: Stewart was prosecuted by former FBI director and US Attorney James Comey. Blagojevich was sent to prison by Comey’s friend and former deputy, Patrick Fitzgerald.“Obviously, we are hopeful that President Trump will pardon Mr. Blagojevich, or commute the remainder of his sentence,” Leonard Goodman, the former governor’s attorney, said in a statement emailed to The Daily Beast. “President Trump has the power to correct this.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Presidents are given the power to pardon and commute sentences with little to no checks at all. But few, if any, have used it in the same fashion as Trump. Prior presidents have been criticized for overtly political decisions, namely Bill Clinton’s pardoning of financier, and indicted tax evader, Marc Rich towards the very end of his time in office. But, by in large, a formula has been followed for determining who receives such reprieves. A pardon starts with a formal submission, which then goes to the Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice, who then makes a recommendation to the Deputy Attorney General’s office, who then makes a recommendation to the White House Counsel's office, who then makes a recommendation to the president. Years can pass. In an expedited time frame, it would be a matter of many months. President Barack Obama rankled social justice advocates by moving slowly in his adherence to this policy. Trump, by contrast, seems to have virtually abandoned it. Mary Price, general counsel of Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM), acknowledged that what the current president was doing was unorthodox. But she remained hopeful that he’d recognize the pardon power could be used towards a greater end. “I don’t want to pretend to look into the heart of Donald Trump. I don’t know what is there. The best use of a pardon or commutation as the founders laid out is to temper justice with mercy,” said Price. “The best use of the power is when it is used to send a message to the system.” Critics of the administration believe that a message to the system is already being sent. The federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election has already netted guilty pleas for some former Trump associates, with others being prosecuted by Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Trump’s sudden rash of pardons, the theory goes, is a signal to, individuals ensnared in the probe that Trump is willing to reward loyalty.That’s what some Trump supporters hope, anyway. Asked for his thoughts on D’Souza’s pardon, Roger Stone, a former political adviser to Trump, told The Daily Beast on Thursday, “I hope Gen. Flynn is next,” referring to former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to federal investigators.Inside the White House, however, the pardons are viewed less as a broader strategic play in the Russia probe and more as statement of political rebellion. According to several sources, the pardon of D’Souza was seen widely as an attempt by Trump to—at least in part—troll his critics by benefiting a political figure widely reviled by respectable people. It wasn’t the first time the president did so either. His pardon of former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff Joe Arpaio generally pleased and enraged all the same suspects. Another recipient of a Trump pardon, former Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby, had been prosecuted by Fitzgerald. But his political legacy was in being a black mark on George W. Bush’s record for that president’s refusal to fully clear his name before leaving office.The pardon of the late boxing champion Jack Johnson last week seemed to have no element of trolling at all, having come a the behest of a sustained lobbying campaign by Rocky star and Trump friend Sylvester Stallone. But even then, the president could not help himself in throwing in a dig at yet another enemy.In his statement on the pardon, Trump stressed that Congress had supported resolutions regarding Johnson but “no president ever signed it,” adding that many people thought and had hoped “it was going to be signed in the last administration, and that did not happen, so it was disappointing for a lot of people.”In fact, Trump is so determined to pardon allies and friends that he’s even reportedly promised such a pardon where he has no authority to give it. Boxing legend Mike Tyson reportedly said last year that Trump had promised to help relieve him of his 1992 rape conviction. But whether or not either of them knew it, President Trump cannot do so: Tyson was convicted in Indiana state court, not under federal law.—With additional reporting by Andrew Kirell."},
 {'title': 'An Arizona PAC Appears to Have Blatantly Ripped Off Donors. Now, the Feds Are Coming After It.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Department of Justice on Thursday brought federal criminal charges against two Arizona men accused of using fake political groups to defraud thousands of unwitting donors out of millions of dollars.Such groups are generally referred to as “scam PACs.” And DOJ’s criminal prosecution represents a major legal escalation against the practice by which those PACs’ executives raise huge sums of money by promising to support political candidates or causes and simply pocket the money instead.According to DOJ, the two Arizona men, Robert and William Tierney, operated at least nine political action committees. They raised money through telemarketing campaigns promising that donations would fund the campaigns of various political candidates, pro-life activism efforts, and autism awareness.In fact, DOJ claims, the Tierneys were using a web of shell companies to steer the money to their own bank accounts. They raised more than $23 million, according to the indictment. The vast majority went to paying the fundraising companies that they used to solicit the money. But the Tierneys pocketed about $3.5 million, while spending just $108,000 backing the groups and campaigns they claimed that fundraising would support.The men are charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. “The so-called political action committees served as nothing more than a front for an extensive personal fundraising campaign,” said FBI assistant director William Sweeney in a statement on the indictment.Legal experts say that DOJ’s indictment represents a major step towards combating scam PACs more generally.“This is a very significant indictment—the first time the Justice Department has used the mail and wire fraud statutes against alleged scam PAC operators,” said Brett Kappel, a partner at the Washington law firm Ackerman. “If these defendants are convicted it will send a powerful message that consumer protection laws apply to political fundraising.”Scam PACs are common on both sides of the political aisle. The PACs capitalize on the lack of legal restrictions on the portion of their money that must be devoted to actual political work rather than staff salaries, consulting fees, and overhead expenses.Civil complaints against such groups have seen limited success. When former Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli sued a group of alleged scam PACs for fundraising in his name and pocketing most of the money raised, the groups argued that the bulk of that money was used to cover overhead expenses associated with the fundraising campaigns themselves. That can be a difficult claim to disprove, and Cuccinelli’s lawsuit was unsuccessful.The Tierneys’ network of PACs was particularly egregious in the sums it spent on overhead and payments to the people running it. But it’s different from other scam PACs only by degrees, and if DOJ is determined to go after the practice, there are scores of other political organizations that could be in legal jeopardy.'},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen to Potential Clients: Stay Away From Corey Lewandowski',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As Donald Trump’s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen shopped around for shadow-lobbying clients early in the Trump era, his pitch included a piece of advice: Stay away from Corey Lewandowski.Three sources familiar with Cohen’s work say that as he worked to build a business as a Trump-whisperer he wanted potential clients\xa0not to sign with Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager and current outside adviser, or other Trumpworld figures trying their hands in Washington’s influence industry.According to people with knowledge of his pitches, Cohen said he had the ultimate access to President Trump, while Lewandowski wouldn’t be able to get things done. Lewandowski “had a lot of heat on him” Cohen would say, according to one person close to him. “I have better access than Corey, is how he’d have it known,” one associate told The Daily Beast.The behind-the-scenes smacktalk didn’t come from nowhere—it was in many ways an outgrowth of a longstanding feud between the two high-profile Trump confidants.Sources tell The Daily Beast that something akin to a “sibling rivalry” has existed between Cohen and Lewandowski since the beginning of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. According to one source familiar with Cohen’s relationship with the president, Trump’s attorney and fixer enjoyed his boss’ trust to the point where he nearly had free reign to conduct himself as he wished during his time in the Trump Organization. This was a source of frustration for years for many people close to Trump, as they watched Cohen get away with things they believed demanded censure.In the early days of the presidential race, Cohen yearned for, and expected, to be tapped for a larger, official role on Team Trump. Instead, he ended up playing only a marginal one in the campaign. Similarly, after Trump was elected, he had told friends and associates that he was expecting a plum gig in the administration—possibly, even, White House chief of staff. Cohen was not given a White House job, and is currently in the crosshairs of federal investigators.His relegation to the periphery of Trump’s political inner circle was, in part, orchestrated by Lewandowski. According to sources and campaign vets who know both men, each felt threatened by and deeply suspicious of the other. Cohen also began to feel slighted—betrayed, even—when Trump began treating his new campaign manager with the sort of political favor and affection that Cohen felt he had earned.Lewandowski, for his part, viewed Cohen as an obstacle to be sidestepped during his ascendance up the ranks of Trump loyalists. Privately, Lewandowski tried to convince Trump that Cohen was a loose cannon, and that his television appearances and shambolic interactions with media outlets—including one where he threatened a Daily Beast reporter in late 2015 while falsely claiming it isn’t legally possible to rape one’s spouse—were actively hurting the future president.Cohen would later complain privately that all he wanted to do was go on TV to robustly stick up for his friend and boss, and that Lewandowski was thwarting him. What followed was years of resentment, distrust, and bitterness between the two top Trump allies.Cohen, who created the website “shouldtrumprun.com” in 2011, saw Lewandowski claiming ample credit for the early Trump victories during the 2016 primary.“It made him furious. Absolutely furious,” a senior 2016 Trump campaign aide recalled to The Daily Beast.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Lewandowski, Cohen, and Cohen’s lawyer did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment as of press time.Halfway through the presidential campaign, Lewandowski was sacked after grabbing and bruising a Breitbart News reporter at a Trump campaign event and causing other headaches for the team.With that, came Cohen’s revenge. According to the book Lewandowski authored with fellow campaign adviser David Bossie, Let Trump Be Trump, Cohen was in the conference room when Donald Trump Jr. broke the news to Lewandowski that he was being ousted from the campaign.Cohen, according to several campaign staffers, relished being in the room to see his rival axed, and was practically “doing cartwheels, he was so happy,” as one person\xa0put it.Flash-forward to the dawn of the Trump era, when Cohen saw Lewandowski poised to make a killing in the influence industry—and Trump’s personal attorney and pit bull wanted in on the action.Now, though, it’s Cohen who appears to most immediately have the “heat on him,” as The New York Times reported Tuesday that his former business partner, deposed New York “taxi king” Evgeny Friedman, has struck a deal with federal prosecutors, and Lewandowski who may have the last laugh. According to a report in The Intercept, Cohen pitched his services during the presidential transition to a former senior official in the Qatari Embassy in Washington. Cohen wanted $1 million to help the official negotiate construction deals in the U.S.They never signed an agreement. But the following year, the Qatari Embassy signed a $150,000-per-month lobbying deal—later hiked to $500,000-per-month—with the firm Avenue Strategies, which was founded in early 2017 by Lewandowski and fellow Trump campaign alum Barry Bennett. (Lewandowski left the firm in May, before it signed the embassy as a client.)Bennett said he was puzzled about the services that Cohen was offering potential clients. “He has no knowledge of the workings of Washington, [and] I don’t think he knows how the State Department is structured, or how DoD is structured,” he told The Daily Beast in a brief interview. “I don’t get it. It just goes to show you the full-blown panic on K Street after Donald Trump was elected.”Cohen never registered as an official lobbyist, instead pitching consulting services that he claimed would help clients navigate Trump’s Washington in ways that avoided work that would trigger public disclosure requirements. But that also legally limited the work he could do, constraining him from, for instance, advocating on clients’ behalf for or against specific federal rules or pieces legislation.“If he’s not willing to talk to the White House on your behalf, because you’d have to register as a lobbyist to do that, what is Michael Cohen going to tell you?” Bennett wondered. “What tie the president is going to wear today? And how is that of any value?” "},
 {'title': 'Reagan Aide’s New Job: Downplay ‘Polish Complicity in the Holocaust’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A former speechwriter and special assistant for President Reagan and then-Vice President George H.W. Bush has been quietly assisting a Polish Warsaw-based organization to minimize the Polish role in the Holocaust, a Daily Beast review of foreign lobbying records has found. The records, filed under the Justice Department’s Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), include a document signed by Clark Judge, the former speechwriter, stating that he would “rectify the false narrative, dangerous to Poland\'s national security and roles in NATO and the EU, of Polish complicity in the Holocaust, extermination camps, and other war crimes.”Poland was occupied by and undoubtedly suffered greatly at the hands of Nazi Germany, of course. But it does not follow that Poles played no role in the Holocaust. Far from it. As Edna Friedberg, a historian at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, explained in The Atlantic, “There are well-documented incidents, particularly in the small towns of eastern Poland, where locals—acutely aware of the Nazis’ presence and emboldened by their anti-Semitic policies—carried out violent riots and murdered their Jewish neighbors.” Worse, Polish collaborators formed a police force of some 20,000 who actively assisted German forces in hunting down Jewish people and guarding ghettos where hundreds of thousands of Jews were detained before being sent to execution chambers. Contrast these historical facts with what Judge’s lobbying registration document goes on to say of Polish complicity in the Holocaust: “Advanced by the active measures of malevolent neighbors, these lies besmirch the reputation of one of World War II\'s greatest victims by equating it with history\'s greatest criminals.”“Short answer: we do not lobby on anything and would not consider any advocacy of any kind for Holocaust denial… under any circumstances.”— Clark JudgeJudge, the former Reagan and Bush speechwriter, is part of a communications shop known as the White House Writing Group. WHWG’s website lists about 20 principals, the vast majority of them GOP veterans. There’s Senior Director Anneke Green, formerly a member of President George W. Bush’s speechwriting team who worked on, among other things, the President’s State of The Union speeches. There’s Senior Director Richard Diamond, who worked in various spokesman roles for former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, who led the “Republican Revolution” of the 1990s. There’s Senior Director Eileen Doherty, a former White House aide to President Reagan.WHWG is apparently targeting Trump administration officials directly with its messaging: per the FARA disclosure, the company "anticipates that it will provide information to U.S. government officials concerning the Polish National Foundations fairness agenda.” \xa0The so-called “fairness agenda” refers to five goals, one of which is to “rectify” the narrative that Poland was complicit in the Holocaust and related crimes.For their trouble, WHWG is being compensated $135,000 up-front for the first three months, then $45,000 per month, plus expenses, according to the agreement. In its FARA disclosure, WHWG describes its employer, the Polish National Foundation, as a “charitable foundation.” Later it explains that the foundation was founded by 17 commercial corporations themselves all government-owned in whole or in part.The Polish Embassy in Washington told The Daily Beast that the Polish National Foundation fell outside their purview, adding, “We categorically deny your allegation that Poland is engaged in any form of Holocaust denial. Poland is one of the principle guardians of the memory of the victims of the Holocaust. The Polish government’s main concern with regards to the Holocaust is the historical truth.”The contract, received by the Justice Department in late October of 2017, comes amid a diplomatic row between Israel and Poland over a new Polish law that criminalizes blaming Poland for Nazi crimes. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, signed the law in early February.The bill renders illegal the use of phrases like “Polish death camps,” making them punishable by up to three years in prison.“The contract comes amid a diplomatic row over a new Polish law that criminalizes blaming Poland for Nazi crimes.”The bill has been championed by Poland’s right-wing Law and Justice party, to which Duda claimed membership until becoming an independent in 2015—--though he maintains a close relationship with Law and Justice.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

According to a report by Israel’s Channel 10 News quoting senior Israeli officials, the Trump administration—including Vice President Mike Pence himself—pressured Israel’s government and its opposition to shut down criticism of the Polish law. According to the report, by diplomatic correspondent Barak Ravid, the Trump administration’s pressuring succeeded in making the embassies of Poland and Israel co-sponsor a Holocaust Remembrance Day.Reached for comment, Judge replied, “Short answer: we do not lobby on anything and would not consider any advocacy of any kind for Holocaust denial… under any circumstances.”Anna Wellisz, a Senior Director at WHWG, added, “For ethical, personal, and family reasons, none of us at WHWG would ever advocate Holocaust denial by anyone to anyone; nor would we ever take a client who does. Poland is a NATO ally. Defaming it weakens the NATO alliance and through that undermines the security of the United States.”'},
 {'title': 'No, Conservatives, Rod Blagojevich Is Not a Sympathetic Figure',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "If you’re looking to get a presidential pardon, the new strategy seems to be to go on Fox News, suck up to the president, and attack his enemies (President Obama, the Justice Department, etc). At least, that’s the strategy disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich’s wife, Patti, seems to be employing. This past weekend, the controversial wife appeared on Jeanine Pirro’s show (a Trump favorite) to talk about how hard it has been for her family to be separated from the former governor. Yes, of course, it’s hard on the family. But you could do the same kind of sob story about almost anyone—guilty or not—who is convicted of a crime and goes to jail. Should we pardon them all?“The same people that went after Mr. D’Souza are the same people that went after my husband—the same people that are going after the president, now—it’s the same M.O. And, you know, they’re using their offices to try to undo elections,” Patti Blogojevich averred, suggesting that this is all some “deep state” conspiracy to dethrone duly-elected truth-tellers and outsiders. \xa0\xa0Luckily, however, President Trump has the power to unilaterally overcome the evil-doers. “Our system of government [has] a system of checks and balances for a reason, and sometimes the courts and these prosecutors get it wrong...and it takes a strong leader like President Trump to right those wrongs,” continued Mrs. Blagojevich.Pirro then went on to suggest that Hot Rod was being punished for “just kind of practicing politics.” If this doesn’t quite sound right, it may be because you have a brain and a memory. “I’ve got this thing and it’s fucking golden, and I'm not just giving it up for fucking nothing,” Blago declared in one conversation about how to fill Obama’s Senate seat. Right. That sounds like perfectly normal politics to me. \xa0What Pirro is obviously trying to do is lay a predicate for undermining the Mueller probe—and possibly pardoning anyone it ensnares. I’m not sure the narrative is as clean as Pirro might want. Like the recently pardoned D’Souza, who admitted guilt, upon being sentenced, Blago said: “The jury convicted me and they convicted me because those were my actions…I am responsible. I caused it all. I’m not blaming anybody. I was the governor, and I should have known better. And I am just so incredibly sorry.”Wait, how could he be sorry when he’s the victim of Obama minions who were trying to undo his election? Or maybe that’s just what his wife is saying in order to make Trump happy (and spring her hubby)?“Conservatives have a way of rehabilitating the most un-conservative (and unsavory) people after they’ve been abandoned by everyone else.”Regardless, if Blago is pardoned, it will signal that (a) celebrity status, (b) access to Fox News, and (c) one’s willingness to be cast as a victim of Obama-era prosecutorial overreach are the necessary ingredients. In other words, anyone who shares those three traits with Trump would qualify for forgiveness.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In fairness, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin has argued that Blago’s term should be commuted—that 14 years is too long. This strikes me as a reasonable argument, but it’s altogether different from the one being advanced by Pirro and Patti Blagojevich.Trump is gonna Trump, and there’s not much we can do about that. But a remaining question is whether conservatives (and here, I’m not sure Pirro even qualifies) will embrace Blago as some sort of hero—or, at least, as some sort of martyr. \xa0Keep in mind, Blago was a Democrat. This was a Democratic scandal. Democrats should own Blago. But if history is any predictor, conservatives have a way of rehabilitating the most un-conservative (and unsavory) people after they’ve been abandoned by everyone else. In a 2014 column titled “The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend: Why Conservatives Are Always Defending The Indefensible,” I described how people like Ted Nugent end up getting embraced by conservatives not because of their merits but just because they are famous and make the right enemies. Blago is merely the latest example of this weird trend. In case you’re keeping score at home, Trey Gowdy and Jeff Sessions are RINO “enemies of the people.” Rod Blagojevich is decent family man and an innocent victim of Obama. Blagojevich is not a conservative (not that that should matter in terms of his gaining a pardon). Nor is he a victim, nor is he a sympathetic figure. What this means is that he will probably not only be granted a pardon, but he probably has a shot at his own Fox News show. \xa0When a corrupt Illinois Democratic politician becomes a conservative cause célèbre, you know something is wrong. Conservatives can, and should, do better. \xa0"},
 {'title': 'The Democrats’ Shameful Collective Silence on Gaza',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The divide between the Democratic base—which is increasingly progressive—and establishment Democrats was on display again this week. We saw it after at least 60 Palestinians were killed, including women and children, and reportedly 2,700 were injured by the Israeli military during protests in Gaza on Monday. Despite this incident marking the biggest loss of life since the 2014 Gaza war, most leading Democrats were silent. It’s time Democrats stop checking their progressivism at the door when it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict because that approach isn’t working for either side. Yet for too long Democratic leaders have followed that view. In fact, the second ranking Democrat in the House, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) did just that Tuesday as he expressed unconditional support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s reaction to the Gaza protests. That view, however, is out of step with the progressive base, as I saw first-hand this week on social media and from callers to my SiriusXM radio show, which airs on the network’s progressive station. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party wants our leaders to be progressives on all issues. That means we should criticize Palestinian leaders if they are acting in violation of human rights or engaging in violence and the same must apply to Netanyahu and his policies. Knee-jerk support of Netanyahu, a man who worked closely with the GOP to undermine President Obama (remember his speech before Congress in 2015 at the invitation of Republicans), is not the route to go if you truly believe in diplomacy and a sustainable peace in the region. After all, Netanyahu declared point blank while running for re-election in 2015 that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch, and he has followed that up with building of illegal settlements in the West Bank. Some congressional Democrats did speak out after the violence Monday but it was only a handful of the nearly 250 Democrats in the House and Senate. There was Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who criticized Netanyahu via Twitter for calling Monday a “glorious day” after the loss of life in Gaza, adding poignantly that Netanyahu “has hurt Israel’s case with American progressives more than any other Israeli leader in history.” “Democratic leaders should be championing progressive ideals that advance diplomacy, regional stability, and human rights when it comes to this 70-year-old conflict.”Others who took to Twitter included Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN), and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), who tweeted that the loss of life in Gaza was “horrific,” adding, “My prayers are with those killed & injured in Gaza.” While Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) issued a statement Tuesday calling on the Israeli military to “exercise greater restraint in the use of live ammunition” and condemned U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley from blocking an investigation by the United Nations into the violence. But of the leading Democrats who are expected to run for president in 2020, only one spoke out forcefully: Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator called the actions of the Netanyahu administration in regards to Gaza “terrible,” adding, “Instead of applauding Israel for its actions, Israel should be condemned. Israel has a right to security, but shooting unarmed protesters is not what it is about.”Interestingly, it was Sanders during the April 2016 Democratic presidential debate against Hilary Clinton who truly exposed the growing chasm between the progressive and establishment wings on this issue. In response to a question about the Middle East conflict, Sanders made it clear that while Israel has a right to defend itself, “there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.” A Democrat calling for an even-handed approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was jaw dropping for some. But in reality, Sanders’ view lines up perfectly with an overwhelming chunk of Democrats as 76 percent of self-described Democrats support such an approach.In that same debate, Sanders then did something previously unheard of from a leading Democrat: He expressed concern for the people of Gaza as human beings. “Right now in Gaza unemployment is somewhere around 40 percent,” he said. “You got a lot of that area continues, it hasn’t been built, decimated, houses decimated, health care decimated, schools decimated.” Sanders added, “I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.” The audience at this debate, held in New York City, erupted in applause. In stark contrast, Clinton’s response was to offer at best lip service to the suffering of Palestinians while defending the Israeli military’s action in the 2014 Gaza war without any reservations. This standard Democratic response elicited no such cheers. That’s why it’s surprising that in 2018 the leading Democrats, who are progressive on issue after issue, are silent on Gaza. No tweets from Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, or Kamala Harris. At least Warren did join in a letter along with 13 other Democratic senators calling on the Trump administration to “do more to alleviate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.” That was a positive step although in the letter there wasn’t even a suggestion that Netanyahu’s policies contributed in any way to the more than 60 dead and thousands wounded Monday in Gaza.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

And there’s no dispute that they bear some responsibility for the violence that took place and should be criticized. But Trump and Netanyahu blaming Hamas exclusively for the human suffering in Gaza may play well on Fox & Friends but not with the facts. This is especially true since it’s now confirmed that no Palestinians had breached the fence surrounding Gaza, meaning the Palestinians killed and wounded were all on the Gaza side of the fence. And per the IDF, only 24 of the 60-plus killed were members of Hamas. There are 1.3 million people in Gaza. Not all are Hamas fighters, despite the recent intentionally dehumanizing claim of Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman that there are “no innocents in Gaza.” In reality, a recent poll by a well-respected Palestinian research firm found only 32 percent of Gazans would vote for Hamas if elections were held today.  And per that same poll, 45 percent of Palestinians living in Gaza want to emigrate to another place (in contrast to only 19 percent of those in the West Bank), but they're in essence prisoners in a densely populated piece of land with a 77 percent poverty rate, high unemployment, little clean water and where\xa0“Breakfast for some schoolchildren is a cup of hot water flavored with a dash of salt.”It’s time the Democratic Party leadership start reflecting its base on the issues of the day from championing health care as a right to raising the national minimum wage to even its approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In a glaring contrast to the GOP’s values, the Democratic leaders should be championing progressive ideals that advance diplomacy, regional stability, and human rights when it comes to this 70-year-old conflict. That’s not only the progressive thing to do, it’s the right thing to do—at least if you want to help the people of Palestine and Israel achieve a just and lasting peace for this generation and beyond.

Perhaps because of resistance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), a late tweet intervention from President Trump and millions of dollars spent against him, Blankenship could not convince enough voters in the state where over two dozen miners were killed, to back his candidacy. As the results were coming in Blankenship seemed to acknowledge that he was doomed, saying “Right now it doesn’t look good.” And he ultimately conceded before the race was even called and Morrisey was declared the victor.Just hours earlier, he had reportedly not campaigned during the final day of the race instead opting to get fitted for a new suit for the general election. Due to state election laws, Blankenship cannot mount a third-party challenge either. Throughout the weekend, concerns in the party had mounted that Blankenship could actually pull this off, creating another stain on the GOP and possibly losing a winnable race against incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). The worry was heightened enough that McConnell reportedly urged President Trump to issue a statement against Blankenship. He obliged.“To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference,” Trump tweeted on Monday. “Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State... No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!”Instead of cowering from this statement, in a state where Trump won almost 70 percent of the vote in 2016, Blankenship surmised that the president was a “very busy man and he doesn’t know me and he doesn’t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.”He would later say, during a televised town hall on Monday, that Trump got his statement wrong about the race and his judgment has been flawed in the past. “Again, we all really like President Trump\'s policies but we know that he doesn\'t get things right,” Blankenship said. “I mean he recommended that people vote for a guy that was basically accused of pedophilia in Alabama,” he said, referencing Trump’s support for Judge Roy Moore, who faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct with minors. While many observers found Blankenship’s ads bizarre and racist, his references to “Cocaine Mitch” and his “China family,” may have earned him enough attention to elevate him to the top three finishers in the race. It wasn’t enough to bring him to victory though. On the plus side, Blankenship’s probation does end on Tuesday night.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In some other contests around the country on Tuesday night, primary voters similarly veered towards safer options. In Ohio, Richard Cordray easily won his Democratic gubernatorial primary, defeating former Rep. Dennis Kucinich. The former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had the backing of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) who campaigned for him and affectionately referred to him as “nerd.” Kucinich had the backing of Our Revolution, the political organization spun out of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) presidential campaign. Notably, Sanders himself did not choose to endorse in the race. “While they did not succeed in winning the Democratic nomination, they ran a campaign that focused on the issues that matter most to Ohioans—affordable health care, a living wage, protecting our environment, getting military-grade weapons off the streets, and addressing the opioid epidemic," Our Revolution president Nina Turner said in a statement after the race was called. Cordray will face off against Ohio’s Attorney General Mike DeWine, who similarly won resoundingly. In the neighboring state of Indiana, Republicans had similarly seen an opportunity to knock off an endangered incumbent: Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN). And while that primary was similarly vicious, it paled in comparison to the risks that West Virginia posed for the party. The candidate that emerged on Tuesday night was Mike Braun, a former state lawmaker who beat two sitting members of Congress: Rep. Luke Messer (R-IN) and Rep. Todd Rokita, both of whom attempted to tie themselves as close to President Trump as conceivably possible. But it may have been Braun’s message, which he emphasized in ads, that the two men were largely indistinguishable from one another, that ultimately set him apart. Perhaps the biggest winner of the entire night though was someone not even on the ballot. McConnell’s team couldn’t hide their glee, particularly with the Blankenship loss. His team tweeted an image of the Senate Majority Leader photoshopped into a still image from the Netflix drug-cartel show Narcos, writing: “Thanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen.”'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Four women who have been in relationships with Eric Schneiderman, New York’s top law enforcement official, recounted horrible experiences of abuse at his hands to The New Yorker. Barely three hours after their accounts were published, Schneiderman issued a statement of resignation.The New Yorker story, “Four Women Accuse New York’s Attorney General of Physical Abuse,” is about just what it sounds like: a man abusing women. It’s not a story about which political party has the real monsters and hypocrites, as Kellyanne Conway was quick to imply in a tweet.  It’s not a story about who gets to step up now in New York politics, as the horse-race forecasters started discussing even before the calls from elected officials for Schneiderman’s resignation started coming in. The story was—though it should not have been—an opportunity for politicians to engage in virtue-signaling, sending out now-safe calls for a disgraced colleague’s resignation in lieu of actually cleaning house, and turning in the known abusers who haven’t been publicly exposed yet. Barely three hours passed before Schneiderman, denying the women’s charges, announced he would resign, and people had already found time to hurl truly unhinged vitriol at one of the women brave enough to speak out against the top law enforcement official in her state, who once told her, “I am the law,” and vowed she’d regret ever crossing him.“How much were you paid?”That’s one of the first tweets responding to Michelle Manning Barish sharing The New Yorker story in which she went public with abuse allegations against Schneiderman. In her tweet, Manning Barish wrote, “After the most difficult month of my life-I spoke up. For my daughter and for all women. I could not remain silent and encourage other women to be brave for me. I could not…”And amid dozens of tweets thanking her for her bravery is that one, accusing her of lying for money. Another wrote, “SCREW YOU. SCREW YOUR DAUGHTER.” Manning Barish’s daughter is 9 years old. “All that matters is to #impeachtrump,” this Twitter user continued. “Much bigger cause than your pride. #metoo my ass. It’s our republic at stake here.”President Donald Trump is not part of The New Yorker story. Nor is Manning Barish’s pride. Her wrist is: “Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasn’t appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician. The process of having it removed was painful and expensive. In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body,” the magazine’s Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow note.And her ear, which “bothered her for months,” after Schneiderman allegedly slapped her across the face one night, before using the weight of his body against hers to hold her down and choke her. Blood trickled out of her ear months later, pooling in her collarbone, she said. She covered for Schneiderman, according to The New Yorker, and lied to an ear, nose, and throat doctor and said she injured herself with a Q-tip.Mayer and Farrow go to lengths in their story of explaining why women stay with men like this, how this kind of abuse persists. As one of Schneiderman’s alleged victims points out, her options for legal recourse—filing an ethics complaint; bringing a civil suit—were inextricably intertwined with the attorney general’s power. Now, in the typical haste with which politicians seem to love seizing women’s pain for their own purposes, Conway wasted no time \xa0promoting the story (“Allegations are harrowing. Violence Against women. Drunk with power. It’s so tough to read you must.”) \xa0and Gov. Andrew Cuomo—who protects abusive men in his own employ—called for Schneiderman’s resignation and for a local district attorney to investigate the A.G. But Schneiderman was investigating Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance for not prosecuting Harvey Weinstein. Where’s the hero in this equation? Forget heroes, where’s the functioning legal process?During her relationship with Schneiderman, Manning Barish said she lost so much weight, her hair started to fall out. Meanwhile, the attorney general squeezed her legs and called her chubby, she said. The top law enforcement official in the state, Schneiderman allegedly told Manning Barish, “If you ever left me, I’d kill you.” When she made “an oblique reference” to him on social media, he allegedly called her and said, “Don’t ever write about me. You don’t want to do that.” The call reminded her of Schneiderman once telling her, “I am the law.” The words were uttered when she objected to being dragged across a street and reminded him, “Jay-walking is against the law,” according to The New Yorker report.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Manning Barish is one of four women to come forward with claims about Schneiderman. Two of the four are still too scared of the Democratic attorney general to go public with their names. One was advised by a number of friends to keep her experience to herself because “Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose.”It’s hard not to see party politics as an unfathomable scourge on society in these circumstances. Schneiderman is only a man, as much as he and his fans would like to think otherwise. He was not the last bulwark preventing the collapse of the republic. He’s a man who couldn’t even stand up to Andrew Cuomo, another political figure who is just a man. Schneiderman is a man who works in Albany, where flagrant abuse has been a widespread issue for years, and he saw no evil. He’s a man who posted some tweets expressing solidarity with women and who sued Trump for a fraudulent university, which was a basic tenet of doing his job in New York State.He’s also, as one of his victimized ex-girlfriends notes, the top law-enforcement official in the state. When he allegedly warned his victims he could tap their phones, have them followed, ruin their lives, they were not wrong to believe him. All of those things are within his grasp. This is a political story insofar as it is a story about a political figure allegedly using his political power as part of his abuse of women. It is a story about political stature weaponized for abuse. It’s hard not to recall the phone call published earlier this year by The \xa0New York Post featuring former attorney general Eliot Spitzer threatening the life of an escort who says Spitzer choked her against her will. One wonders if there is something about this office that beckons to men who allegedly want to exert physical and emotional control over women. Or, for those inclined to make these stories about party politics, we can ask why the New York Democratic Party deems these men electable, holds them worthy of office. It’s fair in New York to poke at the Tammany Hall-style machinery that propels men like this ahead. It’s not fair, anywhere, to expect a woman to be silent for some unrealistic higher goal, like a man this flawed saving the republic. You cannot be a good guy and abuse people. Those two things are incompatible.Like Spitzer before him, Schneiderman tried to claim that his alleged transgressions had nothing to do with his political office. “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office,” Schneiderman wrote in his resignation statement, “they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time.” This is both true and not true. It is true that Schneiderman’s staffers are likely untainted by his alleged abuse of these women, that the work they’ve done to root out fraud and corruption with cases like the one against Trump University or the investigation into Vance, is uncompromised. But Schneiderman allegedly used his political power to abuse these women. He allegedly tried to frighten them into silence by reminding them of the power he held, his power to harm them and get away with it. He is unfit for this office, and that is shown clearly in the way he allegedly treated these women."},
 {'title': 'Resist the Resistance! Impeachment Talk Could Cost Democrats in November.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Republicans searching for an antidote to the Trump toxin have glommed onto impeachment, framing it as a Democratic deep state coup to unseat a conservative president. With the FBI raiding the home and office and hotel room of President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, impeachment is in the air, some Democrats looking ahead to the midterms are eager to wave the bloody shirt as a way to pull the Resistance across the finish line. The ploy, though, is prompting some name-brand Democrats to come down on the other side and oppose impeachment as premature unless of course President Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller, in which case all bets are off.Pushing impeachment would be a mistake, says David Wasserman, who tracks House races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report. “It’s a political loser for Democrats at the moment,” he told The Daily Beast. “If midterms are a referendum on Trump, Democrats win that referendum. If it’s a referendum on impeachment, it’s a much closer question.” There are Trump voters out there who Democrats must win over to gain the majority in the House and possibly the Senate. Trump’s approval rating among Republicans and Independents who lean Republican was 84 percent in the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, with just 15 percent disapproving. Unless it is clear that a super majority of 67 will convict in the Senate, running on impeachment in the midterms may get the Democratic base excited, but it won’t win over Republican-held districts needed to regain power in the House. “This is a case of Democrats becoming their own worst enemy,” says Wasserman, who sees the same looming disconnect with the voters in 2018 that played out in 2016 when the Clinton campaign talked about Trump while Trump talked about jobs and the economy.Too many Democrats are fixated on Stormy Daniels and the latest developments in the Mueller probe while most swing voters in key districts care about the latest Congressional Budget Office score showing the GOP budget blows a huge hole in the deficit, with foreboding implications for social security and Medicare. “Those are the areas where Republicans are really struggling in these swing districts,” says Wasserman. Trump has gone up about 3 points in the polls since the beginning of the year as Democrats instead talk about sex scandals, tariffs and the Mueller investigation—“all marginally better things for Republicans to be talking about than the tax cut bill which is wildly unpopular, and the health care bill, which is also wildly unpopular,” he says.Most Democratic leaders are not talking about impeachment, but they don’t throw cold water on it either, knowing how strongly the Democratic base feels. The fragile truce in the party broke out in the open last week when Obama strategist David Axelrod tweeted: “Dems should NOT commit to impeachment unless & until there’s a demonstrable case for one.It is not just a matter of politics. It’s a matter of principle.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.If we ‘normaiize’ impeachment as a political tool, it will be another hammer blow to our democracy.” Wealthy hedge fund investor and philanthropist, Tom Steyer, responded with a tweet saying Trump has already committed 8 impeachable offenses, asking: “What are we waiting for?” Other than former attorney general Eric Holder, who tweeted, “Ax is exactly right,” there hasn’t been a public stampede among Democrats to shut down talk of impeachment, and with good reason, no one wants to run into a buzz saw from the pro-impeachment left.“I’m not opposed to impeachment,” Axelrod said in an email.I am opposed to asking Democrats or anyone to commit to impeachment before Mueller finishes his work.“Barring an intervening event, such as the firing of Mueller, I think they should wait and evaluate his findings and act on the basis of facts and not passions.“If candidates are forced to commit in advance to impeachment as a term of their election, and the Ds take it up as their first order of business, it will be seen as a very partisan exercise. It’s bad for Democrats and, most important, bad for the country. John Lawrence was Nancy Pelosi’s chief of staff when she faced pressure in the lead up to the 2006 midterms to run on impeachment after Bush was accused of falsifying intelligence to take the country to war with Iraq. Pelosi instead ran on opposition to the Iraq War and protecting Social Security from Bush’s privatization effort. “I remember people pressing her to launch impeachment,” says Lawrence. “She held off.” After Democrats won the majority in 2006, many expected her to turn to impeachment. Omstead. she found areas of agreement with Bush. “She resisted (impeachment) and then 2008 happened, and Democrats won the House and Senate,” says Lawrence. Pelosi has not embraced impeachment this time around either, and if Democrats take back the House, Lawrence expects her to focus on getting bills to the floor on immigration, gun safety and health care, what Lawrence calls “the unmet agenda” that voters want addressed. “That’s where most serious leaders are. We’ve won all the liberal districts. How do we persuade the swing voters? They want a fair tax system, an immigration system that works, jobs and infrastructure, and health care fixed. That’s what they want government to do. They’re not as interested in tit for tat —and they understand if you don’t have 67 votes in the Senate, it’s (impeachment) a wasted effort.” "},

  'body': "For any Donald Trump skeptic or critic, like myself, perhaps it's time to take a fresh inventory of where we stand with the 45th president of the United States.\xa0There are often opposing forces at play causing one to loathe his presence in the Oval Office one minute, and wonder if there is a method to the madness the next. There is the yin, and there is the yang.The yin of Donald Trump is the one he presents publicly: The president who is routinely dishonest, dishonorable, immature, erratic, reckless, spoiled and threatening to our legal and governmental institutions and norms. The yin is what his fiercest critics point to and say, “I was right all along.”The yang of Donald Trump gets less attention, mostly for no one’s fault other than his own. It is the president who seems to get just enough policy victories and international leverage to keep his fiercest supporters crowing that, in fact, they were the ones who were right. “Take that Never Trumpers.”Both his critics and supporters don’t like accepting that the flip side to Trump exists. But the duality is real and it’s important that each side acknowledge its existence.The yin is what drove me and others to oppose his presidency. It’s the guy who is ambiguous at best about Nazis in Charlottesville. It’s the president who accuses a U.S. attorney of breaking into his lawyer’s office. The media critic who lashes out at America’s most successful company, Amazon, because the founder also owns The Washington Post. The yin is the president who is on his golf course seemingly every other day, lining the pockets of his own companies and using his hotels and clubs as swampy influence peddling havens. It is the president who not only doesn’t care about the national debt but openly spurns it as deficits skyrocket; the one whose own staffers speak of him like a toddler to be managed—assuming they, the staffers, haven’t been indicted, resigned or passive-aggressively fired. The yin is the president you can’t tell your kids about. The one who throws civil norms out the window and inflames national divisions. The one who can make Bill Clinton seem almost prude. From Stormy Daniels to playmates to “grab them by their…” You get the idea.The yang is getting some things done. It’s what everyone was thinking after they witnessed the leaders of North Korea and South Korea shake hands last week and call for an end to a seven-decade-long war. “Did… did calling Kim Jong Un ‘rocket man’ and daring him to start World War III… work?” It is the line from Blazing Saddles: “Hold it men, he’s not bluffing!… Listen to him men, he’s just crazy enough to do it!” The yang of Trump leaves you wondering what you’ve witnessed. Was Secretary Pompeo’s visit part of an actually organized and coherent diplomatic strategy? Or was it a bit of good timing, along with leadership in South Korea pushing hard to end the escalating brinkmanship? Maybe it’s a bit of it all. Maybe we just have an overly optimistic global audience whose forgotten North Korea’s past teases. Or maybe we can’t fathom the possibility that Trump actually is on the precipice of this type of geopolitical achievement.And that’s the quandary with President Trump.

The economy is churning… when the market isn’t reacting in mad swings to Trump statements or tweets on trade.

By all accounts, Ambassador Nikki Haley is finally doing what many have wanted done at the United Nations for years.Taxes were lowered. Conservative justices are being appointed. Obamacare wasn’t repealed but it hasn’t expanded. Regulations are being lifted or slowed giving U.S. companies room to grow. From a conservative point of view, there are things to celebrate. So, is the yang worth the yin?Is the tradeoff worth the damage he may cause long term to our politics or our institutions? Is the exhaustion of following his Fox & Friends-induced stream of consciousness for three more years… or seven… worth some quieter results? His supporters, or those who have simply accepted the situation for what it is, said yes a long time ago. There are moments like the Korea summit where his harshest critics should wrestle with the question again.In the meantime, partisans are constantly harping about wishing a president to succeed even when they disagree with them. Perhaps we just need to wish for Donald Trump to succeed where he can, hope to be surprised more often, and give him credit when it is deserved. But don’t forget the yin either."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Scandal-plagued GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy is striking back at a Qatari operative who, he says, participated in hacking his computer and distributing the emails to journalists.According to a lawsuit filed by Briody’s lawyers in federal court on Thursday, Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, along with other defendants, “participated in the strategic planning for and execution of the attacks.” Those attacks, according to the complaint, were comprised of a sophisticated spearfishing campaign to steal email login credentials, hack into Broidy’s email account, gather his emails, and give them to American journalists, “all for the purpose of discrediting Plaintiff Broidy in the United States and interfering with his business relationships.” The complaint noted that the efforts were “largely successful,” as numerous media outlets published stories based on the stolen emails. Rumaihi exploded into the public eye when Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, tweeted a picture of him on an elevator in Trump Tower during the transition period between Election Day 2016 and Trump’s inauguration day. Al-Rumaihi told The Intercept that Michael Cohen asked him for $1 million in exchange for helping a Qatari investment fund with American projects. Cohen told The Intercept that it was “untrue.” A spokesperson for Sport Trinity, a company of\xa0Al-Rumaihi\'s, said the allegations in Broidy\'s lawsuit are not true.\xa0"The allegations made in the complaint filed by Broidy Capital Management and Elliot Broidy relating to Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, a private citizen and principal at Sport Trinity, are completely meritless," he said. "The complaint promotes false and misleading descriptions of Mr. Al-Rumaihi.\xa0 In June 2017, the time identified in the complaint, Mr. Al-Rumaihi\xa0was no longer employed by the State of Qatar or the QIA."\xa0 \xa0Broidy is a vocal critic of the state of Qatar. The hacked emails were prominently featured in a recent AP report that detailed how Broidy and George Nader, a convicted pedophile, covertly worked for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and launched a sophisticated lobbying campaign to try to persuade the Trump administration to take a stand against the Qataris. In return, Broidy and Nader expected to receive lucrative defense contracts, according to the report. Before Nader could cash in on the reported lobbying boon, Special Counsel Bob Mueller got to him—stopping him at an airport and questioning him. Nader is now cooperating with the Special Counsel. A separate lawsuit alleges that al-Rumaihi tried to bribe Steve Bannon. “Mr Al-Rumaihi requested I set up a meeting between him, the Qatari government, and Stephen Bannon, and to tell Steve Bannon that Qatar would underwrite all of his political efforts in return for his support,” said Jeff Kwatinetz, former business partner of the rapper Ice Cube, in the separate lawsuit. Al-Rumaihi holds those allegations are lies. Lawyers for the state of Qatar did not respond to a request for comment for this story. '},
 {'title': 'Fox News Legal Analyst: Hannity ‘Can’t Have It Both Ways’ on Michael Cohen',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'It didn’t seem as though Outnumbered Overtime host Harris Faulkner particularly wanted to talk about Sean Hannity during her discussion with Fox News’ senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano about Donald Trump lawyer Michael Cohen on Tuesday afternoon, but that’s what happened. “Why did we need to know the names of the other clients?” Faulkner asked Napolitano, who explained that Cohen’s lawyer was trying to prove to the court in a hearing on Monday that he had clients besides President Trump. This, of course, led to the “dramatic reveal” that his previously unnamed third client was Hannity. When Faulkner pointed out that Hannity claims he has never been “represented” by Cohen but still thinks he’s entitled to “attorney-client privilege,” Napolitano offered up some rare criticism of his longtime colleague. “I love him. I’ve worked with him for 20 years. He can’t have it both ways,” Napolitano said. “If he was a client, then his confidential communications to Mr. Cohen are privileged. If Mr. Cohen was never his lawyer, then nothing that he said to Mr. Cohen is privileged.”On his radio show Monday, Hannity admitted that he “might have handed” Cohen $10 and said something like, “I definitely want your attorney-client privilege on this.” But Napolitano was quick to bust the “myth” that you can hand someone any legal tender and establish attorney-client privilege—as Walter White famously did with Saul Goodman on Breaking Bad. “The attorney-client privilege requires a formal relationship reduced to writing for a specific legal purpose,” he said. “So anything that is there regarding Sean Hannity can be revealed?” Faulker asked. “In my view, yes,” Napolitano replied. His comments marked at least the second time Hannity’s actions have been denounced on Fox News’ air over the past two days. On Monday night, Trump-supporting lawyer Alan Dershowitz told Hannity to his face that he should have disclosed his relationship with Cohen. “You could’ve said just that you asked him for advice or whatever, but I think it would’ve been much, much better if you had disclosed it,” Dershowitz told the host. Earlier in the day, Fox News released its first official statement about the relationship between Hannity and Cohen. A representative from the network said it was “unaware” of the situation and “surprised” by the revelation, but also that Hannity has Fox’s “full support.” '},

  'body': "On Sept. 25, 2017, a windowless room in the basement of the Capitol Building became the site of one of Washington’s more mysterious recent events. On hand: an investor who was once unsuccessfully sued for allegedly helping murder his own boss, a former congressman from the Florida panhandle, and a former Trump campaign staffer. One of two Ukrainian media outlets to cover the event is owned by an old associate of Paul Manafort’s—a man who federal prosecutors allege to be an “upper-echelon associate of Russian organized crime.”Oh, and the former director of the CIA was involved. The former CIA director told The Daily Beast he wouldn’t have gotten involved if he had known what was going on. One of the American lobbyists said the event was used for propaganda. The guy who got sued over his boss’s death? He now takes credit for the whole shebang. THE BANK TAKEOVERThis story starts in Kyiv, Ukraine, on June 19, 2014. That’s when a woman named Valeriya Gontareva became the chair of the country’s powerful central bank. Ukrainian politics is rife with corruption, especially by American standards, and is dominated by the country’s powerful oligarchs. As chair of the national bank, Gontareva made a host of changes to the country’s financial system—and some powerful enemies. One of the biggest changes she oversaw was a government takeover of the country’s biggest commercial bank, Privatbank. The oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky (who The Wall Street Journal once described as “feisty”) co-founded it. When Gontareva presided over the bank’s nationalization, its accounts were missing more than $5 billion, according to the Financial Times, in large part because the bank lent so much money to people with connections to Kolomoisky. “International financial institutions applauded the state takeover,” wrote FT. “It has been widely seen as the culmination of Ukraine’s efforts since 2014 to clean up a dysfunctional banking sector dominated by oligarch-owned banks.”The bank’s founders weren’t pleased.After the bank takeover, Gontareva received numerous threats. One protester put a coffin outside her door, according to Reuters. On April 10, 2017, she announced at a press conference that she was resigning from her post. She touted her accomplishments at the event, but cautioned that in her absence the country’s financial sector could fake greater troubles. “I believe that resistance to changes and reforms will grow stronger now,” she said. THE FAKE HEARINGFive months later, in Washington D.C., something odd happened: American lobbyists hosted an event, ostensibly on anti-corruption issues, in the basement of the Capitol Building. The event vilified Gontareva. Organizers distributed literature featuring a grim close-up of her face, calling her a threat to Ukraine’s economic security, and asking if she was “CINDERELLA OR WICKED STEPMOTHER?” Serhiy Taruta, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, is named as the author of the report. In 2008, Forbes estimated his net worth at $2.7 billion. According to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, American government officials believed Taruta played a role in the sale of a majority stake in the sale of one of Ukraine’s largest steel groups—valued at $2 billion—to a powerful Russian businessman. Taruta was a close ally of politician Yulia Tymoshenko at the time, and the cable said she and Taruta wanted to keep the deal “hidden from public view” to avoid criticism. Had the nature of the deal been made public, the cable said, Tymoshenko could have faced “increased attacks from political rivals for ‘selling out’ Ukrainian assets to Russian interests, perhaps to finance her presidential campaign.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But Ukrainian reporters who attended the event covered it that way. Former Rep. Connie Mack, one of the American lobbyists who organized the event, sported the pin that members of Congress wear. James Woolsey, former CIA director, attended and spoke briefly to the group. Woolsey’s spokesperson, Jonathan Franks, later said he was duped. “Ambassador Woolsey was deliberately misled about the nature of this event when he agreed to attend,” Franks told The Daily Beast. “He expected to be a member of the audience for a serious discussion of issues facing the Ukraine, an area he’s been interested in for decades. He didn’t agree to be identified a ‘special guest’ nor did he agree to speak. Perhaps he was guilty of being old fashioned, but it never occurred to him the organizers would lure him to an event in the Capitol in order to make him an involuntary participant in a sham.”Rep. Ron Estes, a freshman from Kansas, booked the room for Mack and Co. His office later told The Daily Beast this won’t happen again. Mack and Matt Keelen, a lobbyist whose firm’s website boasts of his “well fostered relationships” in the Trump administration, both disclosed in federal registration forms that they put on the event for a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands called Interconnection Commerce SA. “I never portrayed this as a hearing,” Mack told The Daily Beast. “We didn’t do anything to make it look like a hearing. It was in a very stale room in the basement, no markings of a congressional hearing at all.” At the event, Mack used the term “we” when referring to Congress, and was emphatic that members should investigate Gontareva. “One thing is clear: that we, the Congress of the United States—and there are taxpayer dollars at risk, and there are allegations, suggestions, and evidence—should investigate,” he said, according to an audio recording of the event. Mack blamed BGR Group, a lobbying firm that works for Ukraine’s current president, Petro Poroshenko, for pushing the narrative that he and Keelen put on a fake hearing. Two Ukrainian news outlets covered the event. One of those outlets, ChannelOne, described it as a hearing of the nonexistent “U.S. Congressional Committee on Financial Issues.” “That was pure propaganda on their part,” Mack said. “Whoever those news outlets are, it really is fake news. They had to go a long way to try to make it look like a hearing.” The other Ukrainian news outlet that covered the event was UkraNews, which—according to the Objective Project, which monitors media ownership in Ukraine—belongs to Dmitry Firtash. That name should ring a bell, if you’ve been following the far-flung drama into foreign influence on the 2016 election. Federal prosecutors in Chicago are seeking Firtash’s extradition to the United States to put him on trial for racketeering. Manafort, former Manafort deputy Rick Gates, and Firtash worked on a deal in 2008 to buy New York’s Drake Hotel—for a cool $850 million—but the deal fell through. Lanny Davis—a former special counsel in Bill Clinton’s White House who today represents Firtash—said his client had nothing to do with the hearing. “Mr. Firtash had and has no knowledge of, no position on, and no involvement whatsoever in the congressional briefing that occurred and takes no position and has no interest in the issues discussed,” Davis said. THE MYSTERY MANSo who dreamed up this fake hearing? And who paid for it? For months, the backer of this so-called sham was a mystery. But when The Daily Beast started asking who paid for the event, a little-known figure came forward to take full responsibility: Anatoly Motkin, a one-time aide to a Georgian oligarch accused of leading a coup attempt. A spokesperson for Motkin, formerly an associate to the now-deceased Badri Patarkatsishvili, told The Daily Beast that he paid for the entire event. Alison Patch, a spokesperson for Motkin, said Motkin paid for the event himself in his personal capacity. Motkin was an aide to Patarkatsishvili when he reportedly tried to foment a coup in Georgia. After Patarkatsishvili died, Motkin found himself embroiled in a legal battle with Patarkatsishvili’s cousin. The cousin alleged in documents filed as part of a civil suit in New York state court that Motkin was part of a plot to kill Patarkatsishvili (PDF). A spokesperson for Motkin said he decided to fund the event because Taruta, the Ukrainian billionaire, brought the allegations about Gontareva to his attention. “Although this report was entirely brought by Mr. Taruta’s initiative, for many years Mr. Motkin has worked on promoting democratic values amongst communities close to the former Soviet Union,” said Patch. “Knowing of his interest in supporting anti-corruption efforts, Mr. Taruta shared the information about his report. Mr. Motkin found the evidence presented compelling and decided that if he could help get the issues in front of people who may make a difference, he would.” Anders Aslund of the Atlantic Council, an expert on oligarchs’ politicking, didn’t quite believe it. Aslund said he believes the driving force behind the event was Ihor Kolomoisky—the Ukrainian oligarch whose cronies lost all that money when Privatbank was nationalized. Kolomisky would have millions of reasons to detest Gontareva, the object of the fake hearing’s ire, according to Aslund. “This was entirely Kolomoisky,” he said. “Kolomoisky is crooked and clever. He is a person who makes business by doing bankruptcy rather than making profits.” Kolomoisky has faced allegations of involvement in contract killings, which he denies. An attorney for Kolomoisky did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The short version of all of this: Eastern European politics are circuitous, colorful, and—weird. And last September, a little of that weirdness seeped across the pond and into the basement of the Capitol. "},

  'body': "Wisconsin’s Republican Gov. Scott Walker on Thursday finally called for two special elections to fill vacancies in the state’s Senate and Assembly, after declining to do so when they opened in December.And then he got extremely mad online.The two seats were previously held by Republicans but have been left empty after they joined Walker’s administration. Republican efforts to halt the elections were stymied Wednesday when the Wisconsin Court of Appeals issued a stern ruling calling for the elections to take place. Walker had previously contended that the elections would be a waste of taxpayer money as there would be elections in November anyway and the Assembly is adjourned for the year. District 2 Court of Appeals Judge Paul Reilly became the third judge in a single week to rule against Walker's efforts to halt the elections. “Representative government and the election of our representatives are never ‘unnecessary,’ never a ‘waste of taxpayer resources,’ and the calling of the special elections are, as the governor acknowledges, his ‘obligation,’” he wrote in a rebuke to the governor. Republicans in the state legislature sought to get a bill passed that would cancel the necessity of special elections but that, too, will not happen now. Walker was informed earlier this week by Circuit Judge Richard Niess that he would have until Thursday to call these elections and turned down a request from the governor to put that requirement off for a week so that the legislature could pass the bill. “It is certainly the Legislature’s prerogative to change the law, but until they do, it is the obligation of this court to enforce the law, and the law right now in this state under that statute and by order of this court is that this election shall be held as promptly as possible and that it should be ordered no later than Thursday at noon,” Niess said according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. So on Thursday, Walker relented and ordered special elections for the First Senate District and the 42nd Assembly District for June 12. The governor then lashed out on Twitter, saying: “Eric Holder and the other liberals from Washington, D.C. are using the situation in Wisconsin to raise money for their battles in the fall.” He also said that Holder was using the opportunity to “win elections for governor with the hopes that they can use redistricting to permanently change the makeup of the U.S. House of Representatives and put Nancy Pelosi back in charge as speaker.” Holder’s group, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, had filed a lawsuit demanding that the elections take place.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'The Republican Party Is Exposing Its Own Policy-Making Screw-Ups',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Two major Republican figures have now undercut tax reform—the party’s signature legislative achievement of the Trump era. But the truth former health and human services secretary Tom Price and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) exposed in their respective criticisms is not what many Democrats would like voters to think. The problem, they suggest, is not with the merits of the bill, but with the failure of the Republican Party to level with the public about the tradeoffs involved in getting there. Let’s start with Price. Not long ago, he was advocating getting rid of the individual mandate. But now that it’s gone—via the overhaul of the tax reform bill—he is warning about the potential for rising health care costs. “There are many, and I am one of them, who believes that that actually will harm the pool in the exchange market because you’ll likely have individuals who are younger and healthier not participating in that market,” Price said in a speech on Tuesday. “And, consequently, that drives up the cost for other folks in that market.”This is not exactly a blaring-siren moment. It was always feared that removing the mandate for healthy young people to purchase insurance while keeping the provision requiring insurance companies to cover sick people would lead to “adverse selection.” And yet that’s exactly what Republicans did in the tax bill. At the time, they chose to revel in the pound of flesh they’d taken from Obamacare. And there is certainly a case to be made that granting more choice—including the choice to forgo health care coverage—is consistent with conservative philosophy. But an honest, sober process would have involved consideration of the downsides too. Frankly, it was stunning how little discussion or uproar there was when the individual mandate was repealed as part of tax reform. It was a huge deal, and it was pretty much considered a side issue. At least by Republicans. At least until now. But Price wasn’t the only Republican voicing concerns about the efficacy of the GOP’s lone Trump-era policy trophy. Take Rubio, who recently voiced concerns that are more directly tied to the tax bill, itself.“There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they’re going to take the money they’re saving and reinvest it in American workers,” the senator recently told The Economist. “In fact they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there’s no evidence whatsoever that the money’s been massively poured back into the American worker.”That’s a pretty stunning admission, when you consider that the White House promised us the result of this tax bill, which (among other things) cut the corporate tax from 35 percent to 21 percent, would result in the average family getting a $4,000 raise. But Rubio wasn’t saying that the bill wasn’t worth passing. He was saying that the tradeoffs should have been better understood. He knows this himself, having pushed for a $2,000 child tax credit by slightly raising the corporate rate from 20 percent. He then settled for a watered-down compromise version and voted for the bill.But what Rubio was really getting at was how the bill was presented as addressing a looming crisis that, in actuality, remains unsolved. In the interview, he went on to pooh-pooh the notion that Trump’s policies can bring back working-class jobs. “I have no problem with bringing back American car-manufacturing facilities,” he said, “but, whether they’re American robots or Mexican robots, they’re going to be highly automated.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.This is a true, if not surprisingly candid, thing to say that, yes America’s corporate tax rate was too high; yes it needed to be lowered; and no, lowering it would not be a panacea for creating growth. Saying as much does not undermine conservative orthodoxy regarding supply-side economics, so much as it accepts the fact that the solutions that worked in the 1980s won’t necessarily work in a 21st century where automation is on the rise. So why are we suddenly hearing from these two Republicans about how things are really more nuanced and complicated— terms like “automation” and “adverse selection”—than we were led to believe when the tax bill passed? Why are they undermining their own party’s major policy achievement now, at the precise moment when the party needs something to run on in the 2018 midterms? Having been pushed out of his role at HHS, Price is free to give speeches and give us his honest opinion on matters. Rubio, who is still in office, is the more interesting example. The senator recently hired Michael Needham of Heritage Action to be his chief of staff, a populist conservative whose greatest accomplishment prior to joining Rubio seems to have been pushing Republicans to shut down the government in 2013 (oh yeah, and attacking Rubio’s efforts to reform immigration). Is it a coincidence that Rubio hired a grassroots conservative populist to head his office? Perhaps. Or perhaps, in a Trump-dominated conservative era, he recognizes that the formula for success is to admit that nuance exists in both policy and politics and to take advantage of the vulnerabilities that could soon emerge for the president on the populist left."},
 {'title': 'There Is Something About Marco Rubio That People Just Seem to Hate',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Bounding onto the stage at the “March for Our Lives” rally this past Saturday, Parkland student David Hogg held up a prop price tag and declared, “I’m going to start off by putting this price tag right here as a reminder for you guys to know how much Marco Rubio took for every student’s life in Florida.”He was referencing the campaign donations Rubio has received from the National Rifle Association, as well as expenditures the group has made on the Senator’s behalf throughout the course of his career. The prop had its effect: raising eyebrows, sparking debate, and facilitating a fair amount of complaining about its inherent unfairness. It also spotlighted one of the more interesting trends in politics today: There’s something about Marco Rubio that people just seem to hate.It was evident elsewhere at Saturday’s march. One placard managed to attack Rubio’s Catholic faith (the march was taking place the day before Palm Sunday), while simultaneously calling him an “#NRAbitch” and a “#KidKiller.”By this point, Rubio should be accustomed to the incoming. Rubio worked hard to pass bipartisan immigration reform in 2013, taking on the role of selling the bill to conservative talk radio. It was a political suicide mission if there ever was one and, sure enough, the conservative wunderkind invited all sorts of scurrilous criticism from the right.Now, having made the decision to go against conservative orthodoxy and call for some moderate gun safety reform measures, Rubio finds himself under a heap of anger. The very people who ostensibly need his help to achieve their goals—activists who need Republican lawmakers to support those very measures—have booed him at a post-Parkland, CNN town hall and attacked him at Sunday’s gun control march. Ironically, Rubio seems to be working diligently on this issue. Over at RedState, Sarah Rumpf has an extensive list of the things Rubio has done since the shooting. CNN’s Alisyn Camerota recently noted, “In fact, there is a lot that he has been doing behind the scenes.” Rubio, she continued, “has met and called victims and victim’s families, he participated, of course, in the CNN town hall. He has also bucked his own party and the NRA to support raising the age limit to buy some guns from 18 to 21. This week, he and fellow Florida Senator Bill Nelson announced a bipartisan bill to try to keep people with mental health issues from having guns…”So why all the hostility toward Marco Rubio? It’s impossible to know, for sure, but there are theories.First, the left may view him as a serious threat. Rubio is young and Hispanic. He speaks Spanish fluently. He’s the son of a bartender who made good. He has a beautiful wife and family. Theoretically, he can appeal to a wider demographic range than any other national Republican. Of course, that appeal was limited during the course of the 2016 Republican primary when the party showed its preference, instead, for a vulgar septuagenarian who doubles down on the votes of working-class whites. And for that reason, I’d say Democrats are now past worrying that Rubio is an existential threat. It’s also true that unlike Democrats (see John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton), Republican voters have never really embraced their youth movement. The two recent times the party tried it (see Dan Quayle and Sarah Palin) were rather disastrous examples where a candidate was thrust on voters, via selection as presidential running mates. I think a more compelling argument is that if someone bends on their beliefs, they are viewed, often, as being opportunistic more than constructive. Rubio has suffered from this more than anyone. That may be fair to him or not. But it certainly shows just how little political upside there is in trying \xa0to compromise, find a solution, and make peace.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.And, make no mistake, Rubio is attempting to find middle ground. His reforms include gun violence restraining orders, making it easier for the National Instant Criminal Background Check system to flag people who aren’t allowed to buy guns, and, according to CNN, “he’s open to considering legislation that would raise the age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, and open to reconsidering the size of magazines.” Achieving these modest reforms might, ironically, be bad news for the left. As HotAir’s Allahpundit explains,“Agreeing to Rubio’s [gun] proposals might actually damage the cause of banning guns since it might sate the public’s appetite for greater regulation, at least for a good long while. They want all the guns, and increasingly they’re\xa0not shy about saying so.”Though cynical, this is not an absurd point. Nobody who actually wants moderate gun reform would attack Rubio. If the left is serious about getting something done in this Congress, they need to work with Rubio and not insult him. If the left is going to disparage everyone that takes NRA donations, then how do we get to 60 votes in the Senate? So why do they attack him? Much of the criticism aimed at Rubio seems to be premised on the notion that he’s a spineless phony, trying to pretend he’s interested in compromise, but lacking the will or conviction to actually do something. On this front, however, Rubio is no different (indeed, he may be better) than many of his colleagues and past Senate members. Think of it. Shrewder senators, like Barack Obama (in 2007) and Ted Cruz (in 2013), were always theoretically in favor of doing something to fix immigration, even if no specific bill (that actually had a chance of passing) ever quite measured up. For having the temerity to try to fix our broken immigration system, Rubio was falsely attacked by right-wing outlets like Breitbart.com, which even made up a story that the 2013 Senate immigration bill included government handing out free cell phones. And when he determined that the bill didn’t have a chance of making its way through the House, he walked away—a move that is hardly impractical but was nevertheless interpreted as cowardice.Now, Marco Rubio is favoring some modest gun safety reforms—the kinds of first steps that any intellectually honest person who truly wants to do something to prevent the next mass shooting might endorse—and he is being predictably attacked by both sides. When a young politician named Bill Clinton stands up to his base, it’s called a “Sister Souljah moment” and is heralded as an example of his toughness and heroism. When a young Marco Rubio does it, he’s a weak sellout to his base—and a poseur to his adversaries. I’m not sure why this double standard exists. If one were to derive an object lesson from Rubio’s political career, it might be this: Don’t try to change things. Stick with your tribe. Don’t ever try to find real solutions. And don’t accept invitations to speak to groups that might possibly be hostile to your position. Play it safe. Marco Rubio is the living embodiment of a very old maxim: No good deed goes unpunished.If you venture in the middle of the road too many times, sooner or later, you’re bound to get run over. "},
 {'title': 'The CIA Cleared Her Book Twice. Then It Took It Back. Why? It’s a Secret.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Sarah Carlson spent seven years analyzing the attack plans of Middle Eastern terrorist groups for the CIA. Now the agency is trying to stop Carlson from writing a book about one tumultuous aspect of her service. Carlson is set to file a lawsuit demanding the agency permit her to go forward with a book that touches upon her time as an analyst for the CIA’s highly secretive Counterterrorism Center. The bureau within the CIA that ensures former officials don’t publish official secrets, the Publications Review Board, already cleared her manuscript twice. But in November, two years after Carlson first submitted her manuscript, the CIA board told her that “the entire manuscript reveals classified information,” according to a copy of her imminent lawsuit provided to The Daily Beast. It’s even trying to stop Carlson from publishing her intended book title. \xa0The book, Carlson told The Daily Beast, doesn’t reveal a scandal. She doesn’t “say anything negative about the CIA,” she said. “It’s very focused on a specific year and what happened there during a dangerous environment, a crisis and what we did in response.” About all she can say, now that the agency has revoked its green light, is that it was about a “devolving situation” in North Africa. “I really do want to protect classified information,” Carlson said, and she wrote the book “so hopefully we could avoid a repeat of what happened, avoid the risk of war and intervention outside the major war zones.”      To Carlson’s lawyer, Mark Zaid, who has spent 25 years representing intelligence officers in disputes with their employers, it’s a “frustratingly typical and avoidable” episode from a CIA that remains fundamentally uncomfortable with its alumni’s rights to speak out. Carlson and Zaid claim that the agency has used official secrecy to violate her First Amendment rights. To do so, they allege, the agency has “improperly classified information that is, in fact, unclassified.” The declaration that Carlson’s book contains classified material puts her at risk of prosecution if she publishes it. From April 2008 to September 2015, Carlson, now 38 years old, worked at the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center, analyzing terrorist groups’ plans and patterns of attack outside their Mideast and North African home courts. She was based both out of the agency’s Virginia headquarters and abroad, including in the North African country she can’t name. Before joining the agency, Carlson worked as a counterterrorism analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency, a job that brought her to Baghdad during the occupation. The daughter of a Presbyterian minister, she went into intelligence work soon after 9/11, while her three brothers joined the military. Her faith, she said, helped sustain her in troubling times like the incident at the center of her book. The agency’s position prevents her from discussing what that incident actually was, as well as where and when it specifically occurred. Carlson would not discuss it with The Daily Beast, saying only that it received some press coverage at the time. While Carlson has maintained a relatively low profile since leaving the agency in 2015, she has published analytic articles at security-focused websites like War On The Rocks and Real Clear Defense. Those pieces—which, she said, were cleared by the CIA at the time—focus on Libya. One of them refers to a “harrowing, all-out, 26-hour U.S. evacuation” of personnel from Libya in July 2014, an event well-covered at the time if little remembered now that followed a spasm of militia violence in the capitol, Tripoli. Another confirms her role at the U.S. Mission in Tripoli and said she “helped conduct the full-scale U.S. evacuation.” Carlson said she began writing her book soon after the incident it details, to help her cope and make sense of it, and because she had some concern she might be called to testify about it. (She never was.) Her lawsuit indicates that she submitted her manuscript in October 2015, a month after she left the CIA. According to her lawsuit, the Publications Review Board gave Carlson’s book the all-clear on two separate occasions. The first time was in November 2016, a year after she first submitted it. Following some revisions, Carlson provided the board with another look at her updated manuscript in January 2017, and got a second round of approval in February of that year.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In an added complication, Carlson had asked the CIA to change her official cover status. Though she had gotten aspects of her resume approved in 2015 by the same publication board, without a change in cover status, Carlson’s employment prospects were sharply restricted. She got the new status in September 2017, one that provided her with more leeway to describe her time at the CIA. She now works in an emergency-management related field in the Pacific Northwest. \xa0Ironically, making her more public creates a disincentive for clearing her book, since now her public status would permit observers to trace back her particular experiences abroad and connect them to the CIA. “Now we’re revealing that person is our person in that country on that day,” is how Zaid used a hypothetical example to illustrate the conundrum. (Notwithstanding Zaid’s own high-level security clearance, he has no access, he said, to any classified aspect of her story.) That same month, after consulting with her new literary agent, Carlson made changes to the book. She described them as cosmetic: more material about her personal background, and, in her lawsuit’s phrase, “her thoughts about a high-profile attack that occurred in her assigned country prior to her arrival.” Carlson estimated that the non-personal additions amounted to about a page of new material. She gave the new manuscript back to the publication board soon after.By November, the Publication Review Board had made a wholesale change. They informed her, in a November 15 letter, that “the entire manuscript” revealed classified material, according to the lawsuit, and vetoed publication “in any form.” The CIA declined comment on Carlson’s story. The Publication Review Board is notoriously mercurial. “The process has been painless for some people, but extremely aggravating and frustrating for others,” said Steve Aftergood, an intelligence and classification expert with the Federation of American Scientists. “It’s not, as one might imagine, that senior officials are always given a free ride and underlings are forced to jump through hoops. Even senior officials have been known to tangle with the PRB. It’s been somewhat unpredictable – some people sail through and others spend years, even to the point of cancelling the book project. It’s certainly opaque and often inconsistent and unpredictable.” Carlson’s story is a case in point. Adding to her frustration is two years of correspondence with the agency review board that she said openly reference material from the book it now says is classified – speaking to the retroactive secrecy she claims the agency has pursued. She has not shared that correspondence with The Daily Beast or even her attorney Zaid.“I think I have a unique perspective as a woman, an analyst and a former CIA officer in these kinds of dangerous environments,” Carlson said. But with her book in limbo, and with a looming lawsuit representing her best shot at escaping it, the public is a long way from getting Carlson’s perspective at all. “Part of the problem is I had it all cleared and now it’s not,” Carlson said, “so it’s hard to know now what’s acceptable to say and what’s not.” "},

  'body': "There’s an effort quietly picking up steam in the marble halls of the Capitol to flip the Founders’ vision of government on its head. While it’s not as sexy as all of President Donald Trump’s alleged affairs, the subtle changes under consideration could potentially have a bigger impact on your life than the first lo-fi porn you watched.Vice President Mike Pence came to the Capitol last week to personally relay to Senate Republicans the president’s growing frustration with the slow pace of the Senate’s confirmation process. On Tuesday the White House got some in-house help from Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) who laid out his proposal during a closed-door meeting of Republican senators. The blueprint that’s picking up steam within the GOP is to drastically expedite executive branch nominees, including on many young, extremely ideological judges who will be appointed for life and have a say on everything from your right to obtain contraceptives to where you can buy a wedding cake. Experts say these recent hot button court cases are just the beginning of a coming wave of politically tinged cases that will be winding through the nation’s judiciary after Trump and the GOP leave their imprint on the nation’s third branch of government.The serious reemergence of the “nuclear option”—which means the majority party in the Senate can completely bypass the minority—has Democrats and some senior Republicans nervous their party will follow former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s footsteps who was the last leader to blow up the Senate’s long-standing norms. When Mitch McConnell was then minority leader, he slow-walked, stalled and outright blocked an array of former President Barack Obama’s nominees, so Reid flipped the switch and detonated the nuclear option in the Senate. That enabled most every executive branch nominee to be confirmed by a mere 51 votes. The nuclear fallout from that move still hangs over the Senate, and it seems the GOP is inching closer to launching their own nuke.“I think if they don’t agree it’s possible that there will be an attempt to do the nuclear option—I don’t think we’re there yet,” a senior Republican senator told The Daily Beast on background. “Do I think ultimately the United States Senate at some point gets to a 50 vote margin? I do. I really do. We just keep chipping away…I think that’s where we end up within a decade.” As Joe Biden once said, that’s a “Big Fucking Deal.” But there’s a push to make the slow-moving Senate behave more like the rabid House these days. While Reid and Democrats opened the door for back in 2013, their deal was bipartisan and it exempted Supreme Court justices from the lower threshold. After souring the well even further by blocking Obama from placing Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court, the GOP blew up precedent yet again and deployed the nuclear option to get conservative Merrick Garland his lifetime appointment to the High Court. Now Republicans are crying out for even further changes. ‘We’re trying to figure out how to be able to resolve this, and it’s not just now, it’s from here on out because this doesn’t get better. That’s the issue,” Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) told The Daily Beast.Lankford contended this rift has to be overcome now or it never will be.“What’s happening now to a Republican president is four times more [than]…what we did to President Obama. It will be four times more when there’s the next Democrat president, so the gridlock that’s happening here on the Hill is spreading out to all of government now and that’s not healthy for us,” Lankford said.While Lankford’s proposal is being resisted by many Democrats, some prominent Republicans think his proposal falls short or is even weak.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Ron Johnson (R-WI) told The Daily Beast.Johnson chairs of the Homeland Security Committee. In his role as a chairman he has proudly advocated that Senate committees—a tiny subset of the larger Senate body—should be given the bulk of the responsibility for approving or rejecting the president’s nominees.“The committees do a really good job vetting nominees, they really do,” Johnson continued. “You could convince me to really limit debate; I mean, just bring it up and vote.”The Obama-era ushered in an unprecedented level of obstruction from Republicans, but the sands have shifted and now Democrats are playing an unparalleled level of defense. Still, senior Democrats brush off complaints from their Republican colleagues—both inside and outside of the White House—that they’re slow walking judicial or executive branch nominees.“I don’t know that they have a problem. It seems to me that we’ve been doing nothing but voting on judges,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) told The Daily Beast. She added that Democrats have rightly been attempting to slow-walk or outright block many Trump nominees, especially on judicial nominees.“My impression is that they are younger—which means they last longer—they’re very conservative and some of them do not have much experience,” Feinstein said.Besides lowering the threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees from 60 to 51, Republicans also have done away with the long standing Senate practice of allowing local senators to sign off on the judges within their jurisdiction, known as Blue Slips. That has many Democrats fearing the GOP is going to drop the hammer and upend long-standing Senate norms.“I’ve heard those rumors,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told The Daily Beast.Coons contends the Trump administration is barking up the wrong tree, especially in regards to foreign policy because they have yet to even nominate people for some 25 outstanding ambassadorial posts, including crucial spots like South Korea, South Africa and Turkey, just to name the biggies.“In the foreign policy space, the administration just hasn’t nominated people. So the idea that you need to change the rules of the Senate in order to accelerate confirmations—we’ve moved them through as fast as anybody has for a number of these nominations,” Coons added. “You can see the cumulative impact. Diplomacy is particularly hierarchical, and in countries where we don’t have an ambassador for a year or more you our folks have a hard time making progress.”The partisan tit for tat over nominees is more pitched now than ever before, and Democrats fear the GOP is preparing to go much further in order to place a more ideologically extreme slate of nominees in an array of offices. In the past the 60 vote threshold for nominees restrained presidents from both parties and rewarded them for picking more centrist candidates. But now it seems a race is underfoot to reward the extreme wing of the GOP by merely requiring the support of 50 senators to advance a nominee. “If they want to make another set of rules changes than they should just admit that we are on a downward slope to be a majority rule institution,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) told The Daily Beast. “And if we want to be a majority rule institution than let’s make that decision. Maybe it’s a debate that’s worth having.”"},
 {'title': 'How Trump’s ‘Revolving Door’ Almost Killed Mike Pompeo’s Nomination',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It shouldn’t have been this difficult for Mike Pompeo.Nine years ago, Hillary Clinton—hardly an uncontroversial pick—won the support of 94 senators when she was nominated to be secretary of state. Four years later, John Kerry got the same number of votes. Condoleezza Rice received 85 votes, and even that wasn’t considered a ringing endorsement at the time.But if Pompeo, the CIA director, is confirmed next week to be President Donald Trump’s next top diplomat, it will be because he was scraping for votes at the eleventh hour, just barely clearing the 50-vote threshold.“Everybody’s being creative. I know people are searching for reasons to be against a qualified nominee, and I don’t even want to give them a hard time,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Daily Beast. “I understand that the base on the left just cannot stand anything that makes it look like it’s a proxy vote in support of Trump. I got it.”It’s historically unusual for a secretary of state nominee to face such a tough confirmation battle. Pompeo is on track to become the first nominee for the post in nearly a century to receive an unfavorable vote out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. With at least one Democratic senator set to vote for Pompeo, he’s likely to be confirmed by the full Senate next week—but just barely.An aide close to the process said the administration was surprised at the level of partisan resistance the White House encountered for the usually non-controversial post, especially because Democrats haven’t pinpointed any glaring strategic error on the White House’s part.But it wasn’t just Democrats who were growing tired of the seemingly endless march of nominees for the same positions—from the State Department to the Department of Health and Human Services.A Senate Republican aide, granted anonymity to give a candid assessment, attributed the uphill battle to “nomination fatigue.” The constant looming possibility that Trump will move to fire one of his top officials is angering Republican senators who, in the early stages of the Trump presidency, fought tooth and nail to confirm some of the president’s more controversial nominees. Those officials include Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, both of whom have been on the chopping block.Those factors—fueled by the near-daily chaos that engulfs Washington—have made Republican lawmakers less interested in going to bat more aggressively for Trump’s nominees, even one such as Pompeo whom they all view as eminently qualified.“I see a frustration with the revolving door, and I think members up here are looking at this and saying, we’d really like to establish working relationships with these people, and allow them to establish their teams,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told The Daily Beast. Both Clinton and Kerry had long been punching bags of the Republican party, and were no strangers to controversy throughout their political lives. But they were overwhelmingly confirmed anyway, in part because lawmakers have historically given a president a heightened level of deference to staff his cabinet, particularly early on in an administration.“You know they said things during their presidential campaigns that Republicans didn’t agree with, but they still sailed through,” Corker said, referring to Democrats’ objections to Pompeo’s past statements about LGBT individuals and Muslims.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But this time around, Senate Democrats haven’t been as willing to give Trump the same amount of leeway. Many of them have privately acknowledged that Pompeo is qualified; but they were more concerned that their vote would represent a positive review of the Trump administration’s foreign policy—at a time when Syria remains a geopolitical and humanitarian disaster, and just days after the White House overruled an announcement from Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, regarding new sanctions on Russia.“It’s not so much that Pompeo is a flaming disaster,” a senior Senate Democratic aide told The Daily Beast, requesting anonymity to candidly discuss internal deliberations. “A lot is going on in the world, and that’s manifesting itself in a practical way rather than a theoretical way. And that ratchets up the concern about who fills this spot.”As the Trump administration continues to face more turmoil both at home and abroad, Democrats and even some Republicans on Capitol Hill haven’t been as willing to allow the president to staff his cabinet as he pleases. For Democrats in particular, that raises the bar for each new nominee who—in the case of Pompeo’s nomination last year to be CIA director—they might have supported in the nascent days of the Trump presidency.“You might have previously said, ‘this isn’t my favorite choice, but I’m willing to give the president some latitude here,’” said the aide. “But more recently, with the president acting more erratic, and how he’s handling geopolitical strategic decisions … it’s not comforting these days to say, ‘I really don’t like this person but maybe they deserve this minimal threshold [to get confirmed].’”Democrats often took solace in the fact that Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, aired his disagreements with the president and tried to move him closer to mainstream positions on a plethora of important policy decisions. But in Pompeo, they see a “yes man.” The Trump-Pompeo relationship has been relatively drama-free, and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters on Wednesday that Pompeo has become a “trusted adviser” to the president. Because of that close relationship, Democrats reasoned that Pompeo was so deeply connected to many of the controversial decisions the president has made on issues involving national security and foreign policy—actions that they have, for the most part, opposed.The White House—recognizing that the margin for error remains extremely slim—has in recent days significantly ramped up its campaign to confirm Pompeo, with the president in a series of tweets accusing Democrats of obstructionism. On Wednesday, Conway and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), and increasingly loyal Trump ally, held a conference call with reporters during which Cotton tried to shame certain Democratic senators into voting for Pompeo.“I cannot imagine that senators like Joe Manchin from West Virginia and Joe Donnelly from Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota, who are facing re-election in states that our president won by landslide elections, are going to oppose an obviously qualified nominee for whom they voted last year,” Cotton said, referring to their votes in favor of Pompeo’s nomination last year to be CIA director.Pompeo’s allies were hoping that Tuesday night’s revelation that the CIA chief met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang would help convince Democrats that, despite their characterizations of him, Pompeo was capable of engaging in successful diplomacy with America’s adversaries.“The fact that the president has enough confidence in him to send him over there ahead of confirmation speaks loudly,” Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), a member of the foreign relations committee, told The Daily Beast. “I feel like the other side just wants some drama on this, and there’s really none to be had.”So far, it hasn’t worked. As of Thursday, not a single Democrat on the foreign relations committee was on record supporting him. Just one Democratic senator, Heitkamp, has committed to voting for Pompeo.It might be all he needs.—Additional reporting by Jackie Kucinich"},
 {'title': 'Eric Greitens’ Criminal Charge Dropped—but Prosecutors Will Seek to Refile',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Missouri prosecutors on Monday dropped a criminal charge against Eric Greitens, but the embattled governor should probably hold off on celebrating his good luck. The dropped charges came because of a judge’s ruling that Greitens’ lawyers could call St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner as a witness stemming from allegations of misconduct on her part by allegedly allowing a former lead investigator in the case against the governor to commit and suborn perjury. Gardner’s spokesperson said the ruling would have put her “in the impossible position of being a witness, subject to cross-examination within the offer of proof by her own subordinates.” Prosecutors announced that they plan to refile the charge through a special prosecutor or by Gardner assigning the case to one of her assistants.The ruling came \xa0days before the state legislature will launch a special session to explore impeachment proceedings against Greitens. In response to the dropped charge, Greitens told reporters, “This is a great victory and it has been a long time coming. This experience has been humbling, and I have emerged from it a changed man."The troubles for the GOP rising star began earlier this year when he admitted to having an extramarital affair two years ago. Then the woman with whom he confessed to having this affair alleged publicly that in an effort to cover the whole episode up, he tied her to a bed nude, snapped photos, and threatened to leak them if she ever told anyone anything. This resulted in Greitens being indicted on felony invasion of privacy charges in February. He dismissed the charge as coming from a “reckless liberal prosecutor” out on a “political witch hunt,” and the Missouri GOP (at least initially) backed him up, claiming that George Soros was also behind the effort to smear and unseat Greitens. A month ago, a Missouri state House committee released a graphic, 25-page report with testimony from the woman, who said that she felt “coerced” by Greitens and that at different times in their relationship he “smacked” and “shoved” her. Greitens responded to the committee’s report by calling it “tabloid trash.” If Greitens remains in office, it could damage the bid of Josh Hawley, currently the Missouri Attorney General and leading GOP candidate hoping to seat to unseat Senator Claire McCaskill in 2018. Despite having accepted $50,000 from Greitens back in 2016, attorney general Hawley is currently investigating whether or not Greitens and his staff broke the law by using an app called Confide to delete their communications, some of which may have been linked to his affair and the cover-up. Further, Hawley’s office recently announced that they had uncovered evidence of potential criminal activity involving a veterans charity Greitens’ founded, The Mission Continues.Hawley’s already waded into questionable waters with some of his comments about women, and if Greitens remains in office, 2018 could mark the second consecutive election in which her conservative opponent’s blunders on women and sex helped her hold on to her senate seat.

 {'title': 'Lawmakers Unveil New Plan to Tie Trump’s Hands in Syria',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Senators on Monday unveiled their long-awaited legislation to update and restrict the president’s war-making powers just days after the Trump administration launched a military offensive against the Bashar al-Assad regime.But under the new proposal, lawmakers refused to grant President Donald Trump that explicit authority because, they argue, the president is sending mixed messages and hasn’t outlined a clear long-term strategy with regard to the Syrian civil war.“There’s going to be a lot of misgivings about giving any kind of broader authorization to the executive if we don’t know where we’re heading in Syria—one day we’re putting more troops in, another day we’re taking them out. That’s not a strategy at all,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) told The Daily Beast.Friday’s coordinated airstrikes on the Syrian dictator’s chemical weapons infrastructure, in response to the regime’s alleged chemical attack earlier this month against innocent civilians in Douma, renewed calls among lawmakers for Congress to take back their constitutional obligation.But absent a longer term strategy in Syria, frustrated lawmakers were hesitant to grant Trump the specific authority to conduct military operations against Assad’s forces, apart from ongoing coalition efforts against ISIS in the country. In other words, using military force against the Assad regime would remain illegal.“If [Trump] wants to do something that’s going to be an ongoing effort, then I know he has to come to Congress for an authorization,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Daily Beast, adding that he “said exactly that” to the president the day before U.S., French and British forces targeted the Assad regime directly.Crafting a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) is a rare move for a Congress that has, in recent years, been reticent to reassert its constitutional authority over U.S. foreign policy—namely, its Article I power to declare war. The Bush, Obama and Trump administrations have relied on outdated war authorizations from 2001 and 2002 to legally justify U.S. military operations around the world, often targeting terror groups that did not even exist at the time those authorizations were crafted ahead of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.The new authorization, crafted by Corker and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), “gives [the administration] the flexibility to be successful that they now have, but it also keeps Congress in the loop and having the ability to stop it if they think it’s egregious,” said Corker.More specifically, the authorization allows the president to use military force against terror groups including al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIS, in addition to offshoots of those groups identified in the legislation as “designated associated forces.” It would not, however, allow the president to use military force against a nation state. In other words, the new authorization still would not provide a legal justification for Trump’s decision to launch coordinated airstrikes last week on Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons infrastructure.The administration, critics contend, has sent mixed messages about its intentions in the aftermath of the alleged chemical weapons attack. While Trump himself mentioned a “sustained” campaign against the regime during his address to the nation on Friday night, Defense Secretary James Mattis called the strikes a “one-time shot” aimed at deterring future chemical attacks on the part of the Assad regime. And just days before the alleged chemical attack took place, Trump’s top national-security officials were forced to re-affirm the U.S.’s commitment to eradicating ISIS and other terror groups in Syria, after the president publicly suggested that the U.S. should pull out of Syria. Lawmakers sought to highlight those discrepancies as they push for a substantive voice on the president’s war-making powers.“Assad needs to face consequences for his war crimes, and I would be open to supporting military action if the president came to us for approval and laid out a Syria strategy. But he doesn’t have the authority to do it on his own and striking without a broader strategy is reckless,” Kaine, a co-author of the new AUMF, told The Daily Beast. “If we're going to order our troops to risk their lives, then there has to be a debate and vote by Congress to say this is in the national interest.”Lawmakers have called on the Trump administration to develop a longer term strategy for Syria, even if Friday’s strikes amounted to simply a one-off offensive in response to the alleged chemical weapons attack. Most Republicans, including Corker, and some Democrats have argued that the nature of the strikes is consistent with the president’s Article II constitutional authority.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Complicating matters further, House and Senate leaders would be hard-pressed to force tough votes for their members in an election year.“My first goal is to move something out of the committee, so I don’t really worry about much beyond having a successful vote in the committee, which has been difficult for years,” Corker said. “It is a political season, and everybody says they want to weigh in on AUMF—we’ll see if everybody really wants to weigh in on an AUMF. Until we did something here, I can’t imagine [the House] wanting to take it up.”The issue has been a thorny one on Capitol Hill for years, with some Democrats even challenging the Obama administration over its refusal to entertain a new war authorization. Under Trump, though, the issue has gained more attention and steam as lawmakers from both parties question the president’s foreign-policy prowess.“There’s a lot more interest in this now because of what’s going on in Syria, and with troops losing their lives in Niger—people were saying, we have troops there? There are things that are pushing us toward finally acting on this. It’s just been far too long,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a member of the foreign relations committee who has co-authored previous AUMFs with Kaine, said in an interview.Last summer, the House Appropriations Committee voted to scrap the 2001 AUMF; but that amendment never made it to the House floor. In September, the Senate rejected Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-KY) amendment that would have repealed both the 2001 and 2002 authorizations and would have given Congress six months to craft a new one."},
 {'title': 'Russian Troll Farm Goes After Mueller’s Files',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Lawyers for the company accused of funding Russia’s election interference trolls are demanding that special counsel Robert Mueller turn over reams of information, including the identities of informants, details of any electronic surveillance, and a list of “each and every instance” since 1945 in which the U.S. “engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes in any foreign country.”The ambitious demand for legal discovery surfaced Friday in Mueller’s criminal case against 13 individuals and three Russian companies linked to the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg troll farm that used fake accounts to organize demonstrations on U.S. soil and flood American social media with alt-right memes during the 2016 election. One of those defendants is Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian firm run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close Kremlin ally known as “Putin’s Chef,” who is also named individually as a defendant in the case. Attorneys at the law firm Reed Smith are representing Concord. Though the Washington, D.C.-based lawyers have formally filed an appearance in the case, the government says they’ve refused to accept service of the court summons, and attempts to serve the Russian defendants through other means—like dropping off the summons with Russia’s prosecutor general in Moscow—have failed. Mueller’s team is seeking a postponement of a May 9th arraignment date until the technicality can be ironed out.Concord’s attorneys, though, are wasting no time in demanding legal “discovery” in the case. Generally, the government is required to provide defendants with any evidence it intends to use at trial, as well as any material relevant to preparing a defense. To that end, the defense team is seeking a wealth of information on what the U.S. knows about the trolling operation, including a full list of fake social media accounts, the names of suspected co-conspirators, details of electronic surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies, and identities of Americans who were tricked into aiding the Russian campaign.The lawyers also want Mueller to define a number of terms used in the indictment, including “improper foreign influence,” “significant funds,” and “disparaging Hillary Clinton.” In addition, the defense is demanding information on every U.S.-run election-interference operation since World War II, perhaps telegraphing a pot-kettle defense to the eight-count indictment.“This disclosure should include any and all information regarding the use of computer infrastructure inside and outside of the United States, false foreign identities, goals to sow discord in a foreign political system, assistance to a foreign elected official or candidate, attacks on a foreign elected official or candidate, assassination or conspiracy to assassinate a foreign elected official or candidate, buying political advertisements, posing as foreign persons and/or failure to honestly identify to foreign voters the involvement of any officer, employee or agent of the United States Government,” reads a letter sent to Mueller’s office last month by Reed Smith partner Eric Dubelier.Sensitive discovery usually comes with a court order forbidding the defendants and their lawyers from using the material for anything except trial preparation. It’s unclear how that might apply in a case where the defendant is viewed as an unofficial arm of the Kremlin.'},
 {'title': 'Chuck Schumer to Trump’s CDC Director: Start Gun Research NOW',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When Congress passed a government funding bill in late March, gun-control advocates scored one of their biggest legislative victories in decades. An addendum to the legislative language formally clarified that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not prohibited from spending money on firearm-related research. The provision opened the door to, potentially, millions of dollars flowing into a scientific field that has been deprived of federal resources. But in the month since that funding bill passed, the CDC has not acted. On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) will seek to change that. According to an aide, Schumer is scheduled to meet with CDC Director Robert Redfield in his office, during which he will aggressively push Redfield to commit to starting gun violence research. Schumer’s ask will remain broad, the aide said. The senator has no specific pet research project in mind. He merely wants research to begin. But he will note that the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, has already publicly said he supports government funding of gun-related research, which leaves Redfield as the main obstacle in getting that research started. Should Redfield agree, it would bring a final end to a decades-long prohibition on gun-related research that began almost by accident. In the spring of 1996, Rep. Jay Dickey (R-AR) introduced an amendment that stripped the CDC of any funding that it used to study guns for that year. His proposal was seen, at the time, as a way to mollify the National Rifle Association’s push to defund the CDC’s entire $46 million budget for the National Center for Injury Prevention, from which the gun-related research money was drawn. But the language of the amendment proved to be overly vague and subject to interpretation. Dickey had wanted to stop any gun-control advocacy that could result from research. But federal officials interpreted the text —“None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control”—as outlawing research entirely. Later in his life, Dickey expressed regret with the outcome of his namesake amendment and even made the proactive case for the federal government to start looking into the causes of gun deaths. “If we had somehow gotten the research going, we could have somehow found a solution to the gun violence without there being any restrictions on the Second Amendment,” Dickey said. “We could have used that all these years to develop the equivalent of that little small fence.”But Congress never revised or clarified the language until this March following the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida that killed 17 people. “While appropriations language prohibits the CDC and other agencies from using appropriated funding to advocate or promote gun control, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has stated the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence,” the accompanying language to the omnibus bill read.

But Schumer, who negotiated the revision of the Dickey amendment, wants something wholly different: for the CDC, not an outside researcher, to begin studying the matter on its own. “This is the first time Congress has spoken on this issue in decades and now there is clear intent from Congress that research is allowed,” said a Schumer aide.

 {'title': 'Dick Goodwin, the Kennedy-LBJ Speechwriter Who Changed the ’60s—and the Country',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In the summer of 1954, Richard Goodwin walked into the Harvard Law School library, ready to begin his first day as a member of the Harvard Law Review; a position all but guaranteeing a path to a life of privilege and prestige. For the son of lower middle-class Jews, it was the reward for years of intense study, with summers working as a fry cook at Revere Beach, supplementing a full scholarship to Harvard Law.But as he prepared for the dreary work of checking footnotes from a law review article, something snapped. It was as if, he wrote years later, that he was in a prison. So he turned on his heel, drove back to Brookline, waived his student deferment, and joined the army. After his service, he went back to Harvard Law, where he finished first in his class, was president of the Law Review, and won a clerkship from Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.Fourteen years later, 2 miles east of Harvard Law, Goodwin sat in his office at MIT, where he held a cushy faculty position. It was early 1968, and Goodwin was increasingly despairing of a Vietnam War that had lost all purpose, and a nation seized by racial and generational tumult. His close friend Robert Kennedy had refused to challenge President Johnson for the Democratic nomination, but Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy was embarked on that quixotic effort in New Hampshire. So Goodwin quit his post, jumped into his car, and at midnight, arrived at the Perkins Motel in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he rousted McCarthy’s press secretary, Sy Hersh, walked him to his car, pointed to his typewriter and said, “You, me and this typewriter, Sy; together we’re going to overthrow the president of the United States.”A month later, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote—a stunning, unexpected achievement; four days later, Robert Kennedy entered the race, and two weeks after that, Johnson announced he would not run for another term.“Goodwin shared with Robert Kennedy a mordant sense of humor; a puckish delight in upending the pieties of politics.”These two anecdotes say much about who Dick Goodwin was: the blend of determination, ability, and, yes, a touch of arrogance; but more than that— they point to what made Goodwin so compelling a figure. The last of the New Frontiersmen—when he died Sunday at 85, he was the last surviving member of President John Kennedy’s 1960 campaign team—he embodied one of Kennedy’s favorite observations, from fellow New Englander Emerson: that “a man must share the actions and passions of his time on peril of being judged not to have lived.” Goodwin didn’t just “share” the actions and passions of his time—he threw himself into them, and in so doing, put his mark on those times.Goodwin is best known as a speechwriter, who wrote perhaps the single greatest presidential oration of the post-FDR era: Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 speech on the Voting Rights Act (video here), which proclaimed that “it’s not just Negroes, but really it’s all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.”He was also a principal author, along with Adam Walinsky, of Robert Kennedy’s 1966 “Day of Affirmation” speech in South Africa (video here), which declared: “Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”But his influence extended beyond rhetoric; he was, in a way, an embodiment of at least one part of the ’60s; an era that began with the rise of a younger generation to power, armed with the conviction—which a times shaded into hubris—that it could move mountains, and that ended with an assassin’s bullet in a kitchen pantry in a Los Angeles hotel. In his late twenties, Goodwin was a lawyer for a House Committee that investigated the enormously popular TV quiz shows of the late 1950s. It was Goodwin, the scholarship kid from a Jewish neighborhood in Boston, who confronted and revealed the fraud behind the performance of Charles Van Doren, the epitome of WASP elitism. (The movie Quiz Show tells the story.) It was Goodwin who, at age 29, became Ted Sorensen’s deputy speechwriter in JFK’s 1960 campaign. It was Goodwin who, not yet 30, became the deputy assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs and caused a political firestorm by meeting secretly with Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara in Uruguay. (The meeting led to no diplomatic breakthrough, but Guevara did gift Goodwin with a box of fine Havanas, which appealed mightily to the cigar-loving Goodwin.) By his mid-thirties, he was a close friend of Robert Kennedy, accompanying him on tumultuous trip through South America, where they were harassed by Communist students and swam in piranha-infested waters. It was that friendship that ultimately drew him to leave Gene McCarthy’s campaign and join RFK’s effort, where he worked with director John Frankenheimer on the television ads that helped win primaries in Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California, where Sirhan Sirhan was waiting in that hotel kitchen.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.That, in shorthand, describes what Dick Goodwin did in that decade. But it doesn’t really capture who he was. For one thing, Goodwin shared with Robert Kennedy a mordant sense of humor; a puckish delight in upending the pieties of politics. In his memoir Remembering America, Goodwin describes a memo from a White House aide warning him that a file cabinet of his had been found open at 12:45 a.m. In response, Goodwin sent a memo to the aide, explaining that the aide had just blown up “the most skillful espionage operation in the history of the American government.” The cabinet, he wrote, was filled with deliberately false information.“Then I usually invite someone from the Russian embassy over for a nightcap. At the appropriate moment (around 12:45 am) I say I have to go over to the mansion and leave”—thus leaving the Soviet agent in possession of totally misleading data.Goodwin’s political disappointments in the years after Robert Kennedy’s death were leavened by the arrival in his life of Doris Kearns, with whom he shared more than four decades of marriage. What he—and she—brought to that union was a zest for life that could have powered a medium-sized city. When I traveled to Concord, Massachusetts, to interview them for various books I was writing, dinner at the local inn was endlessly interrupted by a parade of locals from all walks of life—cops, firefighters, lawyers, business folks, politicians, all wanting to trade a quip, or share a conversation with them. (It made the interview tougher, but it made the memory of the dinners indelible.)Goodwin was a less visible presence in the last decades of his life; he wrote for The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, and other venues, as well as a play about Galileo, but he took the most satisfaction from helping Doris Kearns Goodwin with her succession of best-selling histories. In his 2014 introduction to the e-book version of Remembering America, Goodwin wrote that “the memory of the Sixties remains fresh in my mind This is not simply the nostalgia of a man in his eighties. The decade of the Sixties was one of those special moments in our history, when important public issues animated our citizens, when large achievement seemed a realistic possibility; and when the American faith was charged with a determination equal to the needs and the promise of the nation.”This is, of course, a romantic version of that time, one that is rejected and even scorned by a significant segment of the American populace. And Dick’s words have an almost quaint ring in our current political climate. But it’s worth remembering that when Dick Goodwin and his colleagues entered the White House in 1961, no black or woman or Italian had ever sat on the Supreme Court; no African-American had ever been a member of the Cabinet, or led a Fortune 500 company; that from Capitol Hill to Wall Street to the powerhouse law firms and ad agencies, to the executive offices of newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting, your skin color, religion, gender, and family background imposed sharp limits on what you could do and what you could be. Goodwin was part of a movement that changed that bleak reality for good. You can look back on Dick Goodwin’s life and work and see him as a key player in a time, and a politics burdened by its fair share of illusion and overreach. What I see is someone armed with an incandescent intellect, a razor-sharp wit and a fragrant Havana, who put his gifts in the service of causes that changed the lives of millions for the better. John and Robert Kennedy often liked to cited a Greek definition of happiness: “the full use of your powers, along lines of excellence in a life affording scope.” By that definition Dick Goodwin was among the happiest people of his time.\t"},

 {'title': 'Roseanne Roseanne Keeps Promoting QAnon, the Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theory That Makes Pizzagate Look Tame',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Friday night, Roseanne Barr tweeted a bizarre message that no one seemed to understand.“President Trump has freed so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world. Hundreds each month. He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere,” she wrote, adding he gets the benefit of the doubt from her.But as recently as November, Barr fans were speculating that the Trump-supporting actress had secretly been taken out and swapped with an imposter as part of a massive “deep state” conspiracy.Roseanne, Barr’s 1990s show about a blue-collar Illinois family, spent 21 years off air before returning Tuesday to a massive viewership of more than 18 million. Trump called Barr to congratulate her on the ratings. Since the show’s last episode in 1997, Barr’s politics have taken a sharp turn right, with the actress voicing her support for Trump as well as a number of fringe conspiracy theories. In November, she became a bit player in one of her favorite theories: a 4Chan-based conspiracy called QAnon that alleges satanism and sex-trafficking by Trump’s opponents.“who is Q?” Barr tweeted the morning of Nov. 17.“tell Qanon to DM me in the nexxt 24 hours,” she tweeted hours later.“Q” or “QAnon” refers to a user on the anonymous message board 4chan. The user claims to be a high-ranking government official with inside knowledge of the White House where, he claims, Trump is planning mass arrests of top Democrats for allegedly being involved in a satanic child-sex-trafficking ring. Or something. QAnon’s messages have always been vague to the point of near-gibberish, opening them to interpretation. When QAnon has given specifics—like the time he claimed John Podesta would be arrested or indicted Nov. 3—the prediction has fallen flat.Days after that failed prophecy, Barr was on Twitter asking her followers to put her in touch with QAnon. Then, in what believers interpreted as confirmation of the QAnon theory, Barr’s internet presence went dark. Her Twitter account appeared to be suspended for several hours, and her website went offline for “technical reasons” according to a notice on the homepage.“Roseanne had been talking about Q mostly all day and asking him to contact her, now,” one Redditor in the r/conspiracies subreddit wrote of Barr’s disappearance from Twitter, and claiming it confirmed the QAnon conspiracy. “I am viewing this as vindication.”Barr was back online hours later.“guys! i am OK! I’m here-thank you for worrying,” she wrote. “I am OK and back. explanation later on-”“Q claims to be a high-ranking government official with inside knowledge of the White House where, he claims, Trump is planning mass arrests of top Democrats for allegedly being involved in a satanic child-sex-trafficking ring.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.She never appeared to offer the explanation. Redditors noted that Barr had lost more than 200,000 followers during her brief disappearance. The apparent purge suggests Barr’s account may have been flagged as having fake followers. Twitter does not comment on individual accounts, and a representative for Barr did not return The Daily Beast’s request for comment.As for the technical difficulties on her website, DomainTools shows the website underwent a semi-regular maintenance procedure that day. Like many celebrities, Barr registers her website through a privacy-protecting service. The service registers the website under randomly generated email proxies, which change every few months. One of those occasional changes occurred Nov. 17, potentially causing technical difficulties or suggesting other technical work on the site that briefly took it offline.But even with Barr returned, some fans were suspicious that an imposter had replaced her. “How do we know its you?” one tweeted at the returned Roseanne.“Let us know that you are really back,” another tweeted. “Give us a real sign that will let us know it really is you.”Redditors theorized that Barr had suspended herself to draw attention to QAnon. “Conspiracyception: She deleted her account to make it seem like Twitter is cooked,” one wrote.The month after her brief disappearance, Barr deleted all her tweets and announced a temporary Twitter retirement after a knock-down fight with Hillary Clinton supporters on the website.She was back in January, and has since resumed tweeting about QAnon, in apparent contradiction of fans who had previously claimed Twitter was censoring her conspiracy tweets. Since Friday, she has tweeted or retweeted content relating to QAnon (or its other name “The Storm”) at least four times, in addition to a March 24 tweet that read “MKULTRA,” the name of a 1960s CIA mind-control program. The context for the tweet was not clear.Her most recent post about QAnon is a retweeted clip of Stephen Colbert welcoming then-candidate Donald Trump onto his show. “You are not supposed to see this video,” the video, which is tagged with a QAnon hashtag is captioned. The clip, in fact, aired during Colbert’s CBS show. Barr retweeted it early Thursday. Hours earlier, she and Trump had spoken on the phone.The QAnon tweets weren’t Barr’s first dabbling in conspiracy. A prolific Twitter user, Barr had once retweeted an InfoWars report “on the ‘5.7 Million Illegals’ who they baselessly claim voted in the presidential election,” The Daily Beast’s Amy Zimmerman previously reported. Barr has also pushed conspiracy theories about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, whom some truthers believe was killed in a Clinton-ordered hit.Barr’s politics have also tended toward the fringes. In 2009, Barr (who is Jewish) posed for a photoshoot in the Jewish youth magazine Heeb, in which she dressed as Hitler eating singed, human-shaped “Jew cookies.” The magazine, which labeled Barr “the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fuck” later pulled the photo spread. In 2012, she launched a presidential campaign as a Green Party candidate but lost to Jill Stein in the primary. Since then, Barr’s views have veered right with blatantly Islamophobic tweets. In an August 2016 Twitter rant, she claimed “jew hater hillary clinton’s handler huma weiner is a filthy nazi whore.”"},
 {'title': 'Sure, 420 Money Helped Inspire John Boehner’s Belated Cannabis 180, but It’s Still Worth Applauding',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "After years of being “unalterably opposed” to the legalization of cannabis, former Republican speaker of the House and Ohio congressman John Boehner has changed his mind.Earlier today, Boehner said “my thinking on cannabis has evolved” and announced his new role on the board of advisers of a large if little-known American cannabis company called Acreage Holdings, previously known as High Street Capital Partners, which holds plant-touching licenses in 11 U.S. states. Acreage also announced that former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld will join its board of advisers, and both Boehner and Weld have committed to join Acreage’s board of directors once it is formed.“I’m convinced descheduling the drug is needed so we can do research, help our veterans and reverse the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities,” Boehner tweeted.While Boehner’s dramatic about-face on the subject of legalization is an undeniable win for the legalization movement, it also shows how complicated progress is for a movement that has been fighting for sensible drug policy for decades and only witnessed adult-use legislation in the last six years.As speaker of the House, Boehner fought legalization tooth and nail, writing to one constituent in 2011, “I am unalterably opposed to the legalization of marijuana or any other FDA Schedule I drug. I remain concerned that legalization will result in increased abuse of all varieties of drugs, including alcohol.” As Quartz reported this morning, more than 400,000 Americans were arrested for selling and trafficking marijuana between 2011 and 2015, when Boehner served as one of D.C.’s most powerful politicians.But now that Boehner—who stepped down as speaker and resigned from office in 2015—is no longer one of D.C.’s most powerful politicians, he has apparently come around to the idea that legalization is the right path forward for America and the rest of the world. And not only does Boehner support reforming drug laws, he’s actually advocating for descheduling cannabis, a distinction worth pointing out as many prominent Democrats still only support the rescheduling of marijuana from its current (and absurd) position as a Schedule I substance. I spoke earlier with Acreage Holdings CEO Kevin Murphy, who refers to Boehner as a “senior statesmen and thinker.” He acknowledged Boehner’s prohibitionist past but says the former speaker has a compelling answer to the question of his recent shift in perspective.“He’s passionate about the people in this country,” Murphy said of the former speaker, “and when asked what really had an impact on swaying his views, he came forth with one of the best answers I’d ever heard. ‘The people changed my mind.’”Sure enough, a definitive majority of Americans support legal cannabis, but they have for a number of years—so what took Boehner so long to come around? And now that Boehner himself supports legal marijuana, what’s he going to do about his harmful history as a top-level prohibitionist?Those are the questions on some industry veterans’ minds, some of whom reacted strongly to Tuesday’s news on social media.“There’s a great opportunity here,” Ean Seeb, a cannabis industry pioneer and founding partner at Denver Relief Consulting, told The Daily Beast. “But we have yet to see Acreage Holdings execute on anything other than making an announcement that somebody who helped ruin many other people’s lives now has the opportunity to profit from the very same thing that he was actively speaking up against previously.“Acreage could have used this opportunity to create a new foundation that would work to reform cannabis laws, to take people out of prison, to start petitioning for pardons to help nonviolent offenders who were only guilty of possessing cannabis. The industry can see through this entire sham; Boehner appears to only be in this for financial gain.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Even if Boehner is primarily motivated by the prospect of a 420-derived paycheck, his 180-degree swing still represents a significant shift—and will likely be remembered as one of the first high-profile prohibitionists-turned-advocates to come from the upper ranks of the U.S. federal government.Acreage Holdings’ Murphy absolutely sees Boehner’s turn as a tipping point of sorts: “There is no question, and we couldn’t be more proud to be helping lead the charge to what we hope to be a descheduling of cannabis.”Of course Acreage has a dog in this fight—or 11 of them, even. Because cannabis remains federally illegal, Acreage’s marijuana businesses cannot fully integrate across state lines; Any pot products grown or processed in Maryland currently have to stay in Maryland, and the same goes for the company’s 10 other state-regulated markets. But were cannabis to be descheduled and ultimately made legal at the federal level, a far-reaching company like Acreage is then set up to combine and centralize its cultivation and processing resources to fill shelves at its dispensaries in these many states, and likely more, making for a vertically integrated national cannabis chain that would be the envy of the industry.Will Boehner still be around to see that day? Acreage’s Murphy hopes so, but today’s announcement is only the beginning for his high-powered board, Murphy told me.“We couldn’t be more thrilled to have the speaker and Gov. Weld on our board,” he said, “and we look to announce some others going forward who are equally interesting and perhaps equally impactful.” Ricardo Baca, a lifelong journalist, is the founder of The Cannabist and of Grasslands: A Journalism-Minded Agency."},
 {'title': 'Torture Black-Site Chief Gina Haspel Becomes Trump’s New CIA Director',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A career CIA officer deeply involved in its post-9/11 torture program will be Donald Trump’s next director of the premiere U.S. spy agency, the Senate ensured on Thursday. In what quickly coalesced into a foregone conclusion this week, Gina Haspel won sufficient support in the Senate, thanks to nearly lockstep support from the Republican majority and pivotal votes from several Senate Democrats, to run Langley. The vote was 54 to 45, with six Democrats—Joe Donnelly, Mark Warner, Bill Nelson, Jeanne Shaheen, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin—backing Haspel. Only Republicans Jeff Flake and Rand Paul opposed her on the floor, as did an ailing John McCain, who was not present to vote. It was the slimmest Senate margin for a CIA director in the agency’s history.“I will feel safer knowing the CIA has Ms. Haspel at the helm,” said Senate intelligence committee ranking Democrat Warner, whose backing of Haspel all but assured her directorship.Haspel’s victory came after an aggressive public campaign by the CIA to install her as its director by emphasizing her fandom of Kentucky college basketball and Johnny Cash, rather than her time running a black site in Thailand where interrogators under her command tortured a man. And it occurred after Haspel, until now the agency’s acting director, rejected extensive requests to declassify her own torture record, which anti-torture senators and human rights groups said was necessary for an informed vote.The CIA instead provided senators with documents on her agency record, which they could only read behind closed doors—and which Senate bipartisan leadership cut short by fast-tracking the Haspel floor vote to the day after Haspel won the support of the Senate intelligence committee. “What the Senate is doing now is an insult to the public and an abdication of this body’s constitutional responsibilities. It is as stark a failure of oversight as I have ever seen,” said Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, on the Senate floor, who called the agency’s promotion of Haspel “an unprecedented influence campaign.” Human-rights groups and anti-torture senators considered Haspel’s confirmation a debacle. “The U.S. Senate’s confirmation of Gina Haspel for CIA director is the predictable and perverse byproduct of the U.S. failure to grapple with past abuses,” said Laura Pitter of Human Rights Watch. “The torture at the center of the CIA’s rendition, detention, and interrogation program was a crime plain and simple, but the U.S. government has never been willing to admit that or to take appropriate action. Until it does, the U.S. aligns itself with countries that undermine respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law.” \xa0From late October to early December 2002, close to the dawn of the post-9/11 torture program, Haspel was chief of base at a black site in Thailand. There, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a suspect in the USS Cole bombing that killed 17 sailors in Yemen, was waterboarded, stuffed into a small box, lifted by his restrained arms until it seemed like they would dislocate, and subjected to other abuses. Al-Nashiri’s attorneys have described lasting mental damage from his time in CIA captivity. Haspel, a career CIA officer, returned to the agency’s Counterterrorism Center, where she worked for nearly two more years—a period when the torture program, run by the Center, was at its height. At least 119 men were tortured, according to the 2014 Senate torture report, with an unknown but presumed to be larger number sent to foreign countries for outsourced torture, a process known as “extraordinary rendition.” Haspel, in her confirmation hearing last week, refused to specify in public her role in torture while back at the Counterterrorism Center.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Yet a memoir from one of the CIA’s seniormost lawyers at the time, John Rizzo, claimed that by 2005, Haspel had “previously run the interrogation program,” a description Rizzo told The Daily Beast for a mid-April story he stood behind. After The Daily Beast published its story, however, Rizzo suddenly claimed to have misremembered Haspel’s prominence in torture, four years after his book was published. Rizzo’s newfound memory was convenient for Haspel’s nomination, who cited his retraction under questioning at her confirmation hearing. Both at the Counterterrorism Center and later at the National Clandestine Service (NCS), Haspel worked for Jose Rodriguez, one of the leading CIA figures in charge of the torture program and, in his retirement, a leading defender of it as necessary to save American lives. While serving as Rodriguez’s chief of staff at the NCS, Haspel drafted a November 2005 cable ordering the destruction of 92 2002-era videotapes showing the torture of both al-Nashiri and the CIA’s first detainee, Abu Zubaydah. Haspel, at her confirmation hearing, erroneously insisted that only one detainee was taped, something she corrected in official questions for the record without acknowledging either that she was wrong or that she served in a command position at the black site where the torture tapes were made. She conceded, however, that she was an “advocate” of destroying the tapes—something that brought her under federal investigation for destruction of evidence, though the probe ended in 2010 without charges. “The DOJ [Justice Department] recommended Haspel be held accountable for the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes. And the tapes were destroyed, in part, in fear Congress would see them. The CIA ignored the recommendation. And Haspel kept being promoted,” Daniel J. Jones, the lead investigator of the Senate torture report and a former FBI counterterrorism analyst, told The Daily Beast.In its public portrayal of Haspel as a gender pioneer and an intelligence officer par excellence, the CIA played down Haspel’s torture record, tacitly arguing that it ought to be considered a footnote to a storied career. Yet Trump, who has publicly enthused about torture, blasted the opposition to Haspel’s directorship by saying she had “come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists,” indicating that Trump considered Haspel’s involvement in torture to be a credential. While former CIA colleagues who have promoted Haspel’s nomination have portrayed her as a check on Trump, Haspel had nothing but praise for Trump at her confirmation hearing, who she said had shown “enormous respect” for a CIA he once compared to Nazis.“What about the next” brutal act that Trump requests of her, said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) ahead of the vote Thursday. “Should we trust she’ll have the moral compass to stand up and say no?” Haspel would not criticize the torture program at her confirmation hearing. She rebuffed numerous opportunities to describe torture as immoral— something McCain, who survived Viet Cong torture, considered disqualifying—even as she insisted she would not restart it. In a subsequent letter, which was critical to securing the support of intelligence committee top Democrat Mark Warner, Haspel described the torture program as a mistake, not because of the brutality it visited upon CIA detainees, but because it “did damage to our officers and our standing in the world.” She wrote that she would not “condemn those [at CIA] who made those hard calls.”Warner, on the Senate floor Thursday, called Haspel “among the most qualified people to be nominated to be CIA director.” Haspel, who will be the agency’s first woman director, has a deep well of support within Langley. Her victory is a signal moment for a CIA that was willing not only to torture people—an act illegal at the time, despite an ultimately withdrawn August 2002 Justice Department blessing—but to spy on Senate staffers tasked with investigating the torture program. Before and after the Senate’s torture report was published in 2014, the CIA blasted the investigation as biased, even as it moved away from an explicit defense of torture. Human rights advocates, who in March thought Haspel was beatable, have warned that the CIA will consider a Director Haspel to be a vindication of both its torture and its efforts at obscuring the program. “From the outside, I find it hard to understand how any member committed to legitimate oversight would support the Haspel nomination,” said Jones, the lead torture-report investigator.“The Senate found the CIA repeatedly provided inaccurate information to Congress on the techniques and their effectiveness. And that this happened under both the Bush and Obama administrations. This is not a partisan issue.” Jones continued: “What message does this confirmation send to the world, and to the CIA workforce? If the Senate intelligence committee doesn’t hold CIA officers to account, who will?”"},
 {'title': 'Bill Clinton’s #MeToo Defense Is Shocking',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Bill Clinton just doesn’t fucking get it. And he never will. The former president sat down with NBC’s Craig Melvin recently to hawk a book. Melvin, thankfully, didn’t stick to talking about the book that TV talk show hosts will spend the next few weeks pretending to have read. He pivoted to a question about Monica Lewinsky and the #MeToo movement. “Looking back on what happened then, through the lens of #MeToo now, do you think differently, or feel more responsibility?” Melvin asked. Clinton’s body language immediately changed, anger breaking through his omnipresent cucumber-coolness in the way that anger tends to break through when confident liars are called out. “I felt terrible then, and I came to grips with it.” If he felt terrible though, what he said next didn’t reflect it. Instead of remorse, Clinton offered a brand of sleazy obfuscation that has come to personify the gaudy detachment political elites still have from the moment in which we live. There was the self-pity (“I left the White House $16 million in debt”), the argumentum ad populum (“Two-thirds of the American people sided with me”), and the clever, vague distractions (“you typically have ignored gaping facts in describing this”). There was even the misdirection. “I’ve apologized to everybody in the world,” he said when asked whether he’d expressed sorrow to Monica Lewinsky. (For what it’s worth, I wasn’t able to find any reports of him apologizing directly to her.)Alongside Clinton sat his co-author James Patterson, who unhelpfully offered the ancient history defense, pointing out that the events in question were twenty years old. But above all, there was the moral preening that, when distilled to its purest form, is just a ham-fisted attempt to avoid taking responsibility. How could he, Bill Clinton, have been bad to Monica Lewinsky if he, Bill Clinton, had been so good for women elsewhere? “I had a sexual harassment policy when I was governor in the '80s,” Clinton declared. “I had two women chiefs of staff when I was governor. Women were overrepresented in the attorney general’s office in the '70s. For their percentage in the bar. I’ve had nothing but women leaders in my office since.”Clinton didn’t invent his particular brand of self-righteous deflection. Plenty of men in power have tried to use their public-facing record with women as a way to shield their private lives from scrutiny. Former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s propensity to talk about women’s empowerment into a microphone while privately abusing women in his life is so blatantly hypocritical that it almost seemed like a kink. In Clinton’s case, the women he promoted in the AG’s office in the '70s, I’m sure, didn’t volunteer to have their professional lives used in the defense of a man’s behind-closed-doors misogyny. And yet, there they were on Monday morning, the latest variation of human shield for a man who projects power but can’t stand to stomach a simple moment of introspection.Sometimes it’s women doing the obfuscating. Nancy Pelosi originally defended Rep. John Conyers as an “icon” who had long fought for the rights of the disenfranchised. Conyers’ office had paid tens of thousands of dollars to settle sexual harassment claims. Conyers also stepped down and to this day has not acknowledged or even seemed to understand that doing good work in public doesn’t buy you Sin Bucks to spend in private. Of course, it’s not just the Democrats who do this. (It’s never just the Democrats.) President Donald Trump’s minions often cite his promotion of women in the Trump organization as a sign that the man can’t possibly be sexism personified. Kellyanne Conway has trotted out her status as the first ever woman to successfully run a presidential campaign, effectively throwing her body between her boss and the 19 women who have accused her boss of sexual misconduct. Sarah Huckabee Sanders clumsily invokes her womanhood in arguments against sexism. Ivanka Trump has used her gender to defend her father from harassment and misconduct allegations.

And all of the deflection and obfuscation from women who run interference for them is despicable. The difference between the party of Clinton and the party of Trump is that the former seems determined to purge itself of the problems that brought us here while the latter seems determined to do everything it’s been doing before, but louder and with more misspellings. It’s why Bill Clinton finds himself having to explain that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand simply doesn’t know what she’s talking about when she’s airing her grievances with his Oval Office conduct. Meanwhile, Trump-aligned Republicans have not offered a truly serious legislative effort to combat sexual misconduct.And yet, if Democrats are serious about being the party that women can count on to stand up for them, they need to take several giant steps away from Bill Clinton. No matter how many women he’s promoted, he still hasn’t apologized to the one who matters. He still doesn’t understand what he’s done. At least his book tour will be painful. "},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump to Get a Pro-Life Award—A Quintessentially Gross Washington D.C. Story',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will deliver the keynote address at the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List’s Campaign for Life Gala. His adviser Kellyanne Conway will receive the organization’s Distinguished Leader award. Giving pro-life awards to these two individuals recalls a familiar irony in American politics. The ends justify the means, even if the means had to grab a few pussies or pay off a few porn stars to get there. \xa0The irony of Donald Trump’s receipt of this award is fairly obvious. The Susan B. Anthony List is an organization that promotes a specific sort of morals. It describes itself as “a family of organizations, an arsenal designed not to hurt but to heal; not to shame but to shield.” Their gala celebrates “defending women from abortion.”Donald Trump has not lived a moral or healing life. At latest count, he’s fathered five children with three different women. Shortly after his newest wife had given birth to his final child a little over a decade ago, Trump had an extremely horny year wherein he (allegedly) had affairs with at least two women (that we know of), one a Playboy model, the other, a pornographic-film actress. We know about these women because his lawyer organized hush-money payments to both in the leadup to the 2016 election. By his own account, Trump spent decades literally fucking his way through desperate New York climber society. Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen arranged a $1.6 million abortion for the mistress of a prominent Republican fundraiser. (Some have pointed out that there’s plenty of reason to believe that the so-called Broidy payment was actually cover for a pregnant Trump mistress’ abortion, since it was shared so many qualities with other payments Cohen made on behalf of Trump.)President Trump has a checkered history with consent. Nineteen women have accused the president of unwanted sexual advances or other misconduct. Further, the president doesn’t seem to know much about who Susan B. Anthony is. To cap off his awkward first Women’s History Month last year, President Donald Trump awkwardly asked attendees of a women’s empowerment forum if they’d ever heard of her. On one hand, this statement seemed structured like how his other jokes are structured: not clever or incisive as much as deeply weird statements with no setup or punchline. On the other hand, Donald Trump is a stupid man about a lot of things. It’s possible that he didn’t know much about Susan B. Anthony. (Perhaps we should ask Frederick Douglass, who many are saying is being recognized more and more.)Susan B. Anthony List justifies their choice of Trump by pointing out that he’s governed in a more pro-life way than any other president in recent history. Trump’s Supreme Court appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch is defined, for them, as inherently anti-abortion. Trump has stacked the federal bench with anti-abortion judges. He’s imposed a global gag rule on public-health organizations, cutting off federal funds to those that mention the existence of abortion to pregnant women. Last week, he announced he will be imposing the same rule stateside. The Department of Health and Human Services is stacked with appointees who believe that birth control is black magic and abstinence-only education is the only way to keep teens unpregnant. All this from a man who might not understand the difference between HIV and HPV, and who two former paramours claim didn’t use a condom when they had sex. Impressive. The irony of Kellyanne Conway’s receipt of her award is a bit more complicated. Unlike Trump’s, Conway’s pro-life bona fides are long-established. She’s never wavered from her personal anti-abortion stance, nor has she lived her life in a way that would lead one to think she was only pandering. But Conway’s decision to stand behind Trump betrays a hypocrisy among the American right. It’s true that Trump is governing as a pro-life president. But he has not lived a pro-life, pro-family life. Conway, SBA List, and the evangelical wing of the GOP has decided that Trump’s moral bankruptcy is acceptable on a micro level, because, on a macro-level, he will enact policies they agree with. If it sounds a little familiar, that’s because it is. In 1998, Gloria Steinem defended Bill Clinton in a now-infamous op-ed in The New York Times. Feminists shouldn’t be criticized for sticking with Clinton, she argued, because he supported policies that benefited women as a whole.

I don’t think so,” she wrote. “If President Clinton were as vital to preserving freedom of speech as he is to preserving reproductive freedom, would journalists be condemned as ‘inconsistent’ for refusing to suggest he resign? Forget it.”Last November, when the American left was again re-litigating how they processed Bill Clinton’s sexual history in light of the #MeToo moment, Steinem was savaged for that column, which the peanut gallery agreed didn’t age well. At the time, Kellyanne Conway pounced on other “so-called” feminists who soft-pedaled condemnation of Bill Clinton. In an interview with Fox News, Conway called women like Steinem and Hillary Clinton hypocrites. In Conway’s view, Clinton’s acolytes, if they were truly pro-woman, should not have accepted Clinton’s conduct as collateral cost for feminist-leaning laws, for a feminist-leaning Supreme Court justice. Others on the right have pointed out hypocrisy inherent in supporting the principles the Clintons stood for politically yet turning a blind eye to their personal conduct, which is fair. But it’s also fair to point out that the same duplicity is at play now, when religious-aligned groups celebrate the accomplishments of Donald Trump but ignore the way that he’s lived his life. As Bill Clinton was an instrument to Gloria Steinem, so is Trump an instrument to the Susan B. Anthony List and to Kellyanne Conway and to white evangelicals and all the self-righteous Republican moralists in Congress. It’s the same mental gymnastics routine just with a different ideological leotard. \xa0I’ve been thinking a lot about how Dave Chappelle talks about Bill Cosby. “[Cosby] rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape,” said Chappelle. This was during a standup special written and performed in 2017, after more than 50 women had accused Bill Cosby of rape. I don’t want to applaud or boo Chappelle’s joke based on how much I agree with it. I’m bringing it up because it succinctly expresses something uncomfortable both ends of the American political spectrum have grappled with. He saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Congratulations to President Trump and Kellyanne Conway, champions of doing what everybody else has always done. "},

The condo, which is where Pruitt stayed while getting his bearings in Washington, D.C., is owned by Vicki Hart, a prominent lobbyist with clients who had business before committees on which Crapo serves. Her husband, Stephen Hart, the now-ex chairman of the firm Williams & Jensen, had his own set of clients before a separate committee that Crapo chairs.Crapo’s campaign said in a statement to The Daily Beast that they had reimbursed Hart for use of the townhouse in order to be in complete compliance with election law. And it stressed that, unlike Pruitt, the townhouse was never used for boarding purposes. “No one from the campaign or Freedom Fund ever used the townhouse for an overnight stay,” said Sam Neel, an associate with the firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP, in a statement. “Both committees have disclosed to the FEC the date and purpose of each use of the space, as well as the corresponding reimbursements.”But the arrangement struck watchdogs as falling decidedly over the line of sound government ethics. “This arrangement raises all sorts of red flags,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center. “The Harts gave Pruitt a cut-rate rental deal and gave Sen. Crapo a place to hold fundraisers, and meanwhile, their lobbying clients may have been asking Pruitt and Crapo for favors.”“I’d also like to know what the agreement was between the Harts and Crapo’s campaign,” he added in an email. “Did Crapo and his staff call the Harts every time they used the condo to get let in, or did they have a key or access code to come and go as they pleased?”From 2014 to present, Crapo held dozens of fundraisers, campaign meetings, phone-banking events, and political strategy sessions at the Harts’ Capitol Hill condo, which is owned, through an LLC. Of the 78 total events, 33 were fundraisers, according to the FEC filing. (Neel said that Crapo’s leadership PAC, Freedom Fund, held three additional events.)One GOP lobbyist said it wasn’t unusual for staffers (often from around the country) to gather that frequently in D.C. But usually such meetings take place at restaurants or the National Republican Senatorial Campaign offices and not a lobbyist-owned rowhouse“[It’s] not really smart to do it at a lobbyist’s townhouse,” the lobbyist said.Crapo took over the chairmanship of the Senate Banking committee in 2017. And Williams & Jensen has numerous clients with interests under his jurisdiction. The firm has disclosed work on at least ten pieces of legislation considered by the committee since Crapo received the gavel.The senator himself sponsored two of those bills. One of them was a relatively esoteric measure to extend the term of a key federal insurance regulator. Insurance companies pushed hard for the bill, and Williams & Jensen reported pressing Congress on the legislation on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers. President Trump signed the bill into law in September.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Williams & Jensen had lobbied Congress on that bill on behalf of at least seven clients, including ACLI, Visa, securities market OTC, and banking law firm Luse Gorman.A spokesman for Williams & Jensen declined to comment. Though Crapo’s work on the Banking Committee overlapped considerably with the interests of Williams & Jensen’s clients, the more interesting intersection of financial and political interests likely involved Vicki Hart, according the GOP lobbyist. The president and founder of Hart Health Strategies, Inc, Hart has numerous clients in the health care sector. They include Johnson & Johnson, the Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of America, the American Society of Plastic Surgery, and the American Urological Association. Among the committees with the most jurisdiction over the healthcare industry, few, if any, have more power than Senate Finance. And in the next Congress, Crapo could end up being that committee’s chair. Congress’ current top financial overseer, Orrin Hatch (R-UT), is retiring and current finance committee member Sen. Chuck Grassley—who is more senior—may not give up his post atop the Judiciary Committee. Should that happen, Hart would have a lobbyists’ dream scenario: incredibly tight ties to one of the most powerful committee chairs in Washington, D.C. Hart herself is already a Crapo donor. She gave the senator $2,000 on May 12, 2015, a day on which Crapo’s campaign reported holding a fundraising dinner at Hart’s home. The fundraiser’s other attendees aren’t known, but a host of health care and financial services companies and executives reported donating four-figure sums to Crapo within 24 hours of the event.“The fact that he is spending so much time with one lobbyist and is so dependent on their townhouse for fundraising raises serious questions about his independence from big money interests,” said David Donnelly, President and CEO of the good government group Every Voice and Every Voice Action. “It is very clear that he has a special relationship with this lobbyist.” Other lobbying shops make use of Capitol Hill townhouses to host fundraisers and get-togethers for lawmakers. But few, if any, of locations have gained as much notoriety as the condo at 223 C Street, NE. The Harts also rented out that townhouse to Pruitt for a period of several months in 2017 when the then-EPA director was looking for places to stay in Washington, D.C. That arrangement raised numerous ethical questions for Pruitt; chief among them, whether he did any favors in exchange for the $50-per-night lease. Both Stephen Hart and Williams & Jensen had clients with business before the EPA at the time Pruitt stayed there.The condo has also been the sight for fundraisers for lawmakers other than Crapo. As The Daily Beast previously reported, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), held events there. Rep. John Katko (R-NY), had a “cigar night” reception at the townhouse, while Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and former Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) also held receptions there. Crapo’s use of the location appears to have far surpassed that of any other member of Congress, however. His campaign ultimately reimbursed Hart’s company $7,800 for each the events—for which, Hart told the campaign, she charges $100. Crapo’s joint fundraising committee previously paid out $300 for three events at the condo. Both entities told the FEC that they were not aware that the home was owned by an LLC, which, under federal law, is prohibited from giving in-kind donations—such as a free fundraising venue—to a campaign committee.Though Crapo’s campaign says its revisions are efforts to ensure compliance, its letter to the FEC indicates that it may have been accepting illicit contributions from Hart even before ownership became an issue. The campaign told the FEC that it held 67 events at the condo during the 2016 election cycle, and reimbursed the LLC for the resulting $6,700 that it initially considered in-kind contributions from Hart herself. That sum is significantly more than the $5,400 any individual can legally donate to a political campaign in a single election cycle.In admitting its errors, in other words, Crapo’s campaign appears to have copped to another fundraising shenanigan. Neel did not address this matter. "},
 {'title': 'Senate to Trump: Back Off Your Bid to End Net Neutrality',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Senate on Wednesday delivered a rebuke to the Trump administration when all Democrats and three Republicans voted to reinstate net-neutrality regulations that the Federal Communications Commission scrapped last year.The measure was largely symbolic, as it stands little chance of passing through the House of Representatives and virtually none at all of winning the signature of President Donald Trump. But it shows a political opening for proponents of net neutrality, should the balance of power swing toward the Democrats after the midterm elections later this year. It also illustrates that the debate over how data is transmitted on the Internet is not cleanly divided along partisan lines.Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), John Kennedy (R-LA), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) were the only Republicans who voted for the resolution, which was introduced by Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA). Without their support, it would not have passed. Those Republicans backed the measure even after GOP leaders undertook an intense lobbying campaign against it. Despite strong objections from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and his leadership team, Democrats successfully forced a vote on the issue using the Congressional Review Act, a mechanism that allows Congress to nullify regulatory decisions from federal agencies.“People thought we weren’t going to succeed in the Senate. And we’re succeeding in the Senate. We’re going to make a run at this in the House and we think we have a real shot,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), who helped lead the effort and was engaged in long conversations with other lawmakers on the Senate floor during the vote, told The Daily Beast.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) dubbed the endeavor “a futile, symbolic gesture because it’s not going to go anywhere, but so be it.” McConnell, in an impassioned speech on Wednesday morning, said Democrats were trying to “regulate first, and ask questions later.” He argued that Democrats were more interested in making net neutrality a campaign issue than anything else.Under net-neutrality rules, telecommunications companies and Internet service providers were prevented from favoring certain data types over others. Those regulations, which were put in place under the Obama administration, were rolled back under Trump’s FCC, which ruled that Internet providers could charge consumers more for better data delivery. The FCC’s decision, known as the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, takes effect on June 11.“Under the 2017 order, an Internet service provider can throttle, block, or discriminate so long as it discloses,” Kennedy told The Daily Beast. “The response to that is, well, just switch Internet service providers. For some, they can. Others can’t.”A December poll found that 83 percent of Americans opposed the FCC’s decision to repeal the Obama-era net-neutrality regulations. The same poll found that 75 percent of Republicans agree. And with the midterm elections just six months away, Democrats are hoping that enough House Republicans will fear a backlash from their constituents—and they’ve warned that rolling back the regulations could cause some Americans to pay more for even slower Internet speeds.“Most of the primaries are over for these Republican members, and they’re going to be looking for an opportunity to demonstrate some independence,” Schatz said. “This is that opportunity to them. And if they don’t demonstrate the independence on net neutrality, then the voters will deliver the consequences.”'},
 {'title': 'A Second Paul Manafort Associate Has Turned on Him',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort has trouble in his own house. According to court documents, one of Manafort’s former employees led an FBI agent to a storage locker filled with paperwork on Manafort’s businesses and finances. The person’s name is redacted from the filings. But he’s now at the center of a fight over evidence that could play a significant role in the government’s case against Manafort. “People do strange things when confronted with authoritative FBI agents,” said Sol Wisenberg, a criminal defense attorney with Nelson Mullins. This makes the second Manafort associate known to have aided the government in the sprawling investigation into foreign influence in U.S. politics. Rick Gates, Manafort’s long-time right hand, began cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office in February.Manafort’s attorneys revealed the information about the second former employee in an April 6, 2018, court filing. In the filing, Manafort’s attorneys asked the federal judge overseeing the prosecution to block documents found in a storage unit in Alexandria, Virginia, from being used as evidence against him. They argue the employee did not have the authority to let the FBI agent look into the storage unit, and that, therefore, the FBI violated Manafort’s Fourth Amendment rights. Manafort’s filing includes a heavily redacted affidavit signed by an FBI special agent on May 27, 2017. In that affidavit, the FBI agent explains how he learned about a storage unit full of documents from Manafort. The agent describes meeting with “a former employee of Davis Manafort Partners, and a current employee of Steam Mountain, LLC, which is a business currently operated by Paul Manafort.” The employee, whose name is redacted throughout the affidavit, told the FBI agent that he “performs a variety of functions for Manafort and his companies as directed by Manafort,” and was salaried. That employee moved boxes of files from one storage unit to a second, larger storage unit in Alexandria. On May 26, 2017—just nine days after Rod Rosenstein named Bob Mueller special counsel—the person whose name was redacted led the FBI agent to the storage facility. The facility’s manager gave the FBI agent a copy of the lease for the storage unit. “The lease identifies [REDACTED] as the occupant of Unit 3013, and also identifies Paul Manafort as a person with authorized access to Unit 3013,” the application says. “Rick Gates is listed as an alternate point of contact for the lease.” “One box was marked as containing expenses, paid bills, invoices, and legal complaints. Another box was had info on the ‘Ukraine Campaign.’”The person whose name was redacted also gave the FBI agent “a key to the lock on Unit 3013 and described the contents of Unit 3013,” according to the affidavit. That person also gave the FBI agent “written consent” to search the storage unit, and opened it for the FBI agent. The FBI agent then looked into the storage unit and saw about 21 boxes of documents, as well as a filing cabinet. One box was marked as containing expenses, paid bills, invoices, and legal complaints. Another box said it contained “Ukraine Binders,” as well information about ballot security, Georgia, research, and “Ukraine Campaign.” Manafort and Gates have been involved in Ukrainian politics for years, and helped prop up Kiev’s Putin-friendly strongman, Viktor Yanukovych.The FBI agent seemed to figure out immediately that the storage unit’s contents were interesting, because the law enforcement officials started surveilling the storage unit facility to see if anyone went in to take out any files. The day after seeing the storage unit, the FBI agent filed the affidavit—which was more than 20 pages long—with a magistrate judge.

The affidavit said the person who showed the FBI the storage unit was listed on the lease as the “occupant” of the storage unit. Manafort’s lawyers also filed the lease with the court as part of their motion to suppress the storage unit evidence. And the lease name a man named Alexander Trusko as the storage unit’s “Occupant.” The lease also names Rick Gates and Paul Manafort as having access to the storage unit. (Trusko could not be immediately reached for comment.) Manafort’s lawyers are arguing that the former employee didn’t have the authority to let the FBI agent look inside the storage unit. The lawyers describe the one-time employee as “low-level” and responsible for “administrative functions.” They argue that the FBI agent violated Manafort’s Fourth Amendment rights by looking into the storage unit, and that the former employee didn’t have the lawful authority to let the FBI agent look into the storage unit.“[T]he former employee had no such authority, and the FBI Agent knew it,” Manafort’s lawyers wrote.

 {'title': 'How to Kill Democracy in Four Easy Steps: Lessons on the Gestapo at 85',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The screams could not be heard from the street. The building, Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 8, had previously been the Berlin School of Industrial Arts and Crafts and was too solidly insulated to reveal to passers-by the consequences of its new role as the headquarters of the Gestapo.Inside was Hans Otto, an actor and member of the German Communist Party and chairman of the League of Workers’ Theater. One evening in 1933 he was picked up in a café by stormtroopers and taken to the Gestapo offices.A few days later he was glimpsed by a fellow detainee for the last time: “He no longer was able to speak but could make only indistinct sounds…he was half naked and I could no longer recognize his face. His body was one bloody lump.”Otto died shortly afterwards. He was 33. Today you can visit the site of the Gestapo building, as I have done, although the school no longer exists – it has been replaced by the Topography of Terror, a museum that, as its name suggests, occupies the very ground in Berlin where the Nazi terror machine was initiated. (Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse no longer exists, either, it is now Niederkirchnerstrasse.)When the Berlin Wall came down and the city, with the country, was unified Berlin recognized and formalized its guilt in directing Nazi atrocities by creating two searing places of pilgrimage, the Holocaust Memorial, a field of thousands of concrete slabs just south of the Brandenburg Gate and the Museum of the Jewish People, a building that has its own deliberate and visceral sense of entrapment as it records the extinction of millions of Jews, family by family, train load by train load.But the Topography of Terror is equally important. It shows how many Germans were themselves victims of the terror and it is Germany’s own testament to the ghastly kind of efficiency that conceived and executed the nightmare. The location of the museum was chosen two years before the Berlin Wall came down, in 1987, when it was still in East Berlin under communist control. Not far away and unmarked in a parking lot behind some new apartment blocks was the site of the bunker where Hitler committed suicide in 1945.\xa0 As the site was excavated the cellars of the former school, converted to prison cells by the Nazis, were uncovered. But prisoner interrogations did not take place there. They were conducted in the offices above.That detail in itself struck me as I studied documents in the museum: this whole operation was, from its beginning to its end, run through a bureaucratic apparatus, with all the impersonal pedantry that that implies. I leafed through fat spiral binders, the kind of files you might pull from a shelf in any office, and became chilled to the bone. They were the Gestapo’s commonplace bookkeeping, how many arrests made per day, neatly signed and counter-signed.The torture – “intensified interrogations” in the official jargon – was recorded as a clerical exercise, carried out by those who became known as the schreibtischmorder, armchair murderers.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.As ghastly as it was, the Gestapo apparatus was often merely a way station to death. Travel arrangements having been dutifully signed and counter-signed, prisoners were sent on their way to the concentration camps.The first of those camps, Dachau near Munich, was opened 85 years ago this spring. In the first year about 4,800 people ended up in Dachau. They were the first wave of victims as Hitler set about eliminating all opposition. Many, like Hans Otto, were communists, trade unionists and social democrats, those who had most saliently and bravely fought the rise of the Nazis. There were also Jeovah’s Witnesses, Roma, homosexuals and those called, simply, “asocials.”Very few of them were Jews. Those who were had the misfortune to fit into the assigned categories. Otherwise this was not the beginning of an organized genocide but the immediate purge of those Germans who were seen as most dangerous to establishing the new despotism.Nonetheless individual groups of anti-Semitic thugs realized, correctly, that they were now free to attack Jews without restraint and there was an outbreak of very public attacks on Jews, some lethal, all over the country.In response to the attacks on Jews there were calls in other countries, including the US, for a boycott of German products. The American, French and British governments did not support the boycott but Hitler, inflamed, ordered a counter-boycott of Jewish shops and department stores beginning on April 1. In the event, there was only sporadic public support for the boycott and its enforcement was haphazard. It lasted for only a day. More sinister was a new law issued on April 7 to “restore professional bureaucracy” in which the civil service was to be purged of Jews. This was followed by a purge of Jewish doctors, lawyers and teachers.Between July and October 1933 three other anti-Semitic laws were passed, the last one removing Jews from the editorships of newspapers.The real shock of those early months in 1933 is to recognize how rapidly and easily German democracy was destroyed. Nobody has put it better than Ian Kershaw in his masterly biography of Hitler:“Hitler was, in fact, in no position to act as an outright dictator when he came to office on 30 January 1933. As long as [President] Hindenburg lived, there was a potential rival source of loyalty – not least for the army. But by summer 1934, when he combined the headship of state with the leadership of government, his power had effectively shed formal constraints on its usage. And by then, the personality cult built around Hitler had reached new levels of idolatry and made millions of converts as the ‘people’s chancellor.’”I have made several trips to Berlin out of a personal quest to try to better understand how this happened. And now it seems to me to have become more and more important because people of my generation, who grew up during World War II in Europe, live permanently in a peculiar state of heightened vigilance. We are clearly more sensitized to the persisting threat of fascism than those who don’t feel or understand the darkness with the same intimacy. Even then, I’m reluctant to apply the Nazi analogy to the present because it so easily exaggerates the threat and, by doing so, strangely understates the real horrors of my childhood. But in several ways it does flash up salutary warnings for today, the first being that elites are not very good at rebutting excesses of power and preserving democracy.After all, Germany was a nation with one of the world’s most widely respected intelligentsias, with centuries of leadership in literature, art, music, sciences, theological and political thought. Yet the universities and cultural elite articulated no effective opposition to Hitler and his thugs. They sat on their hands as what remained of the political opposition was systematically exterminated. At the same time, the industrial leaders sensed new fortunes to be made in an arms race and the military leaders were either already signed up party apostles, like Hermann Goering, the creator of the new air force, or supine like the heads of the army and navy.Four things prepared the ground for this capitulation.The first was a disdain for elites of any kind, stirred up deliberately to encourage a sense of grievance in the masses of people who had suffered in the economic collapse of the 1920s and who viewed the flagrant decadence of Weimar Berlin as evidence of an urban elite (often portrayed as heavily influenced by Jews) that held too much sway.The second was an understanding of the importance of a well-orchestrated propaganda machine. In the person of Joseph Goebbels Hitler discovered one of the great geniuses of modern political propaganda and, gaining control immediately of the national radio network, Goebbels infused the most pervasive new arm of the national media with the Nazi narrative of national rebirth under Hitler’s guiding vision of the Fatherland.The third was putting into place all the apparatus of a police state in which the tasks of surveillance, intelligence and punishment were divided between the Gestapo and the state security service, the Reichsfuhrer-SS.All this prepared the ground for the fourth and final step that would enforce total and unquestioning loyalty to the Fatherland: war. Those four stages in the death of German democracy do not have any exact modern equal, either in the degree of their fanaticism or in the scale of the final catastrophe they produced, but there are elements that should be disturbingly familiar to us as precursors.The disparagement of elites as imagined co-conspirators with the “deep state” was part of Donald Trump’s playbook from the beginning, and remains a familiar theme, reinforced by the bigoted chorus of Steve Bannon and Breitbart and, moving deeper into the shadows, by white supremacists.Trump’s base was incubated and indoctrinated by what Andrew Sullivan has rightly described as a “full bore state propaganda channel” of the kind that Goebbels would have loved to have had at hand – Fox News.While we are nowhere near approaching a police state we have readily succumbed to a degree of state surveillance of questionable legality on the basis that it is essential for national security.And we have seen that by simply equating the launching of wars with the obligations of patriotism we get trapped into endless foreign conflicts with little hope of ever winning them, while feeding the military-industrial complex with billions and billions of dollars.But it may well be that the real warning here is the reverse of what it at first seems to be, the emergence of a demagogue in the form of Trump. Trump certainly has some of the instincts of a demagogue. He clearly loves strongmen to the point of idolatry. But he could actually be a weak man hiding behind the aspirations of a strongman. Ideologically he is a vacancy and intellectually he is, to say the least, weak and lazy.That kind of weakness in a president is dangerous. George W. Bush was similarly weak and was led to disaster by a zealot, Dick Cheney, who gave us the Iraq war and the surveillance state. If John Bolton turns out to be Trump’s Cheney – he certainly has the ambition – the outcome could be the same, or even worse.Indeed, a subtle form of proto-fascism has already infiltrated our lives. The torture of prisoners of war, voter suppression and the enforced deportation of immigrants all have large bodies of support as the concept of “normal” changes almost by the hour.But most alarming of all, and another uncomfortable reflection of Germany 85 years ago, is that the people who should most immediately constrain this threat, the congressional leadership, are virtually silent accomplices. In fact, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan display a level of moral abasement that suggests that, even if they ever knew any modern history, they have forgotten it in the cynical pursuit of their political agenda. That is how democracy dies, not with a bang but with a whimper."},
 {'title': 'Trump Has Leverage Over the Saudis. Is He Too Scared to Use It?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Trump is hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office on Tuesday, a meeting with tremendous opportunity but one also rife with potential pitfalls. At its core, the discussion will be centered around re-affirming our long-term relationship with Saudi Arabia. But, as with any long-term relationship between countries, the discussion should also be viewed as an opportunity to assess how we’re feeling and if we want anything to change. It also should be seen as an opportunity for this White House to act boldly. We have leverage with the Kingdom, and now is the time to use it. Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Vladimir Putin continues to deepen, and President Trump should take advantage of his meeting with the Crown Prince to ask Saudi Arabia to turn a colder shoulder toward Russia. That may seem like a large demand, especially for President Trump, who has been historically reticent to call for any kind of pushback on Russia. But after the Russia-linked CW attack in the U.K. and the now public news that Moscow hacked our electric, water, and nuclear plants, the weight of Russian aggression should be too much for even Trump to ignore. He can start by pressuring Salman. If Saudi Arabia is really a trusted ally, then it too should care about the existential threat to our country and Putin’s ongoing attack on the U.S. and our interests abroadThe Saudi-Russia relationship didn’t used to be mutually exclusive with our own ties with the Kingdom. But a lot has changed since Putin decided to attack every aspect of our democracy.While Trump has largely turned a blind eye to Russia’s attacks, Saudi Arabia hasn’t exactly toned down their love affair with Russia either. After Putin won his “election” on Sunday, King Salman sent him a congratulatory cable. Salman visited Russia in October, reportedly signed billions in arms deals (which should trigger U.S. sanctions), and deepened the Saudi/ Russia energy partnership.This doesn’t really paint a picture of the Saudis standing up to defend our interests. Quite the opposite really.So far in his presidency, Trump has shown himself to be mostly unwilling to push the Saudis, perhaps because he recognized the importance of our security alliance and economic ties. Our relationship — spanning more than 70 years — has had tangible benefits. Saudis buy our weapons, invest in the U.S., and we work together against threats like Iran and Saddam Hussein. Trump’s first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia where he talked about countering extremism and announced a hefty $100 billion arms deal. But Trump isn’t always afraid to ruffle feathers. In the ghosts of tweets past, he lambasted Saudi for wanting women as slaves, killing homosexuals, and claiming that the Saudi government had ties to 9/11. Back in November, meanwhile, Trump issued a statement urging the Saudis to lift their blockade of food, water, medicine and fuel into Yemen, which is causing a horrifying humanitarian crisis (the Saudis say the blockade is against Iranian backed rebels in Yemen). Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, moreover, definitely didn’t win cheers in Riyadh. \xa0The president should have a real DTR (define the relationship) conversation with Salman in the Oval Office and lay our cards on the table. The Saudis want us to do more to counter Iranian meddling, and we should want the Saudis to do more to counter Russian meddling (stressing the should here because, again, it’s not clear that Trump will be willing to address this during his meeting). An easy way to establish some new goodwill would be Saudi Arabia canceling their arms deals with Russia because Putin actually wants the money and enjoys the narrative that a major ally of the United States is buying weapons from America’s biggest enemy, Russia. Not to mention the flouting of U.S. sanctions.We have leverage with the Kingdom, and without getting overly transactional, we should point out that every good relationship is built on mutually beneficial actions. The Oval Office is the ideal date to do some couples therapy, address ways we can help each other out, and move forward, together.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'body': "Stormy Daniels might not be the only porn star suing President Trump’s attorney. Alana Evans, a fellow adult-film actress, is planning her own defamation case against Michael Cohen, The Daily Beast has learned.“Because of his words, Stormy and I are continued to be called liars even after the man admitted he actually did pay her off,” Evans said.Evans said some longtime fans have turned against her because of Cohen’s statements, which deny Daniels’ tryst with Trump.“We work very hard in our industry to show the world that we’re credible people,” Evans, who just celebrated her 20-year anniversary in porn, told The Daily Beast. “The industry is filled with strong, intelligent women like us.“To have worked so hard to be such a solid person in the business and have one person strip it away from you because they’re lying to protect the president… it’s terrible,” she said. Evans said that Cohen’s statements—which came after she spoke publicly about Daniels—were defamatory, even though Cohen didn’t use her name in particular. In January, Cohen issued a statement to The Daily Beast in response to Evans’ story, saying, “These rumors have circulated time and again since 2011. President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.” (In her 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper, Daniels said she was pressured into denying the affair after her nondisclosure agreement was revealed in January. She signed statements provided by Cohen, who then released them to the media. “If it was untruthful, why did you sign it?” Cooper asked in the Sunday episode. “Because they made it sound like I had no choice,” Daniels replied.)“We work very hard in our industry to show the world that we’re credible people. The industry is filled with strong, intelligent women like us.”Meanwhile, Evans also referred to an Independent report where Cohen’s attorney, David Schwartz, called Daniels’ account a “complete and utter lie.” Evans says she was the only corroborator speaking publicly about Daniels’ tryst at the time. Schwartz called the story “recycled old fake news that has no validity whatsoever” and said “everyone named, including Mr. Cohen vehemently denies this,” the Independent reported.“It is fake news like this that has people questioning what is real and what is fake,” Schwartz concluded in a statement to the U.K.-based outlet.Cohen and his attorneys didn’t return messages for comment by press time.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In a first amended complaint filed Monday, Daniels’ attorney says Cohen “meant to convey that Ms. Clifford is a liar, someone who should not be trusted, and that her claims about her relationship with Mr. Trump is ‘something [that] isn’t true.’“Mr. Cohen’s statement exposed Mr. Clifford to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame, and discouraged others from associating or dealing with her,” the document continued. Team Daniels was referring to Cohen’s public statement on Feb. 13, when he admitted to paying Daniels $130,000 of his own money but said that “neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction.”“We’re not going to stand by as these two powerful men spread their falsehoods about what happened.”“Just because something isn’t true doesn’t mean that it can’t cause you harm or damage. I will always protect Mr. Trump,” the statement read.Shortly after the 60 Minutes episode aired, an attorney for Cohen sent a “cease-and-desist” letter to Daniels, Reuters reported. The letter referred to Daniels’ claim that a stranger threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011, weeks after she spoke to In Touch magazine about Trump. The man warned, “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.” While Daniels never explicitly stated that Cohen was involved, his lawyers pounced. “Mr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,” said the letter, sent by attorney Brent Blakely to Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti.Evans said she was thrilled to hear of Daniels’ defamation claim, as she gears up to file one of her own by the end of the month. “We’re not going to stand by as these two powerful men spread their falsehoods about what happened,” Evans told The Daily Beast. The adult film star has publicly spoken about Daniels’ alleged 2006 romp with The Donald at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.Back then, Evans was Daniels’ neighbor and close friend and happened to be in Lake Tahoe, too. Evans said Daniels repeatedly called her and tried persuading her to come to Trump’s hotel room, but Evans declined the invitation. “Stormy calls me four or five times, by the last two phone calls she’s with Donald [Trump] and I can hear him, and he’s talking through the phone to me saying, ‘Oh come on Alana, let’s have some fun! Let’s have some fun! Come to the party, we’re waiting for you,’” Evans told The Daily Beast earlier this year.The next day, Daniels dished on her rendezvous with the reality TV star. She told Evans, “All I’m going to say is: I ended up with Donald in his hotel room. Picture him chasing me around his hotel room in his tighty-whities.”“I was like, ‘Oh I really didn’t need to hear that!’ Then she said he offered her keys to his condos in Florida, and I was like, ‘Wow guess you had a good night,’ and that was the last we ever spoke of it,” Evans added. Since her interview, Evans has appeared on TV to discuss her reaction to every installment of what’s become the Stormy soap opera—and, as the president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild, to support her friend and fellow performer.On Monday, Evans told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that Daniels still has the dress she wore the night she bedded Trump. When asked why that’s the case, Evans replied it was perhaps a “keepsake” or “actual proof” of the affair. “I can only speculate the things that may be on that dress, especially if it’s never been washed,” Evans said, harkening to the Clinton-Lewinsky probe.As The Daily Beast reported, Evans and Daniels are allegedly facing threats for speaking out on Trump. One man threatened to shoot Daniels at one of her strip performances on her “Make America Horny Again” tour, Evans said. Evans said Cohen’s statements are tarnishing her reputation in the industry. She said she interacts with her fans and has become friends with some of them. When one particular fan called her a liar, Evans said it hurt her. “I’m good to my fans. I interact with them. I’m not untouchable,” she said. “People were coming at me. Fans that had been my fans for ages for the first time doubted my credibility and said to me, ‘You know, well, Michael Cohen says it’s not true, so Alana, why are you lying?’ and I cried,” Evans said."},
 {'title': 'White House Attorney Ty Cobb Says Trump’s Interview Negotiations With Mueller Are Still On',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The president’s personal legal team is still negotiating a possible interview between President Trump and special counsel Robert Mueller, according to White House lawyer Ty Cobb. “The Cohen searches, while they have taken time away from discussions with regard to an interview, certainly have not brought those discussions to a halt,” Cobb told The Daily Beast. “They continue.”There have been reports, including at The Washington Post on April 17, that the negotiations for a potential interview between Trump and Mueller’s team have sputtered to halt in recent weeks after the FBI searches of longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen’s office and hotel room. The raids certainly appear to have rattled the president. “Attorney-client privilege is now a thing of the past,” he tweeted after news of the raid broke. According to Cobb, however, none of this has stopped negotiations about a potential interview. “The Cohen searches have not yet changed our strategy or level of cooperation with the special counsel,” he said, referring to recent raids on the home and workplace of Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime personal attorney. Jay Sekulow, the president’s personal lawyer, told The Daily Beast, “We continue our ongoing cooperation with the Office of the Special Counsel.” Any sit-down would bring the risk of perjury for the president if he knowingly misstated the facts to Mueller’s investigators. One of Bill Clinton’s impeachment counts came because Ken Starr concluded he lied to a grand jury. Trump’s relationship with facts is a dicey one; of all his statements that The Washington Post fact-checked during the campaign season, more than 60 percent got the maximum number of Pinocchios. These risks are among the reasons that John Dowd, formerly a member of the president’s personal legal team, staunchly opposed having the president sit down with Mueller. Despite the risk, however, there is historical precedent for special counsels interviewing presidents. John Danforth told The Daily Beast last May that he interviewed then-President Bill Clinton by phone when he was special counsel investigating the Waco disaster. NBC reported on April 12 that the president’s legal team—prior to the raid—had entered the final stages of negotiations, determining “final sticking points, including the timing, scope and length, according to people familiar with the discussions.”The president’s legal team got a new addition on Thursday: Rudy Giuliani, the longtime Trump ally and former mayor of New York. The Daily Beast was the first to report that Giuliani was in talks to join the president’s legal team. Giuliani told CNN he hopes to help expedite the conclusion of the Mueller probe within “a couple of weeks.” Most outside observers believe the probe will last much longer than that. \xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Cobb, long a vocal proponent of cooperation, said that Bannon’s criticism of his strategy doesn’t bother him. “It has zero effect on me,” he said. “I’m a do-the-right-thing guy.“I don’t worry about Bannon,” he continued. “I don’t worry about any outside criticism. This is a live-fire game and you’ve got to be able to take incoming and keep making progress on behalf of the interests of the White House.”Cobb also said that the president’s legal strategy does not involve doling out pardons to people trying to decide whether or not to cooperate with Mueller. “Pardons are not part of any discussions and certainly not part of any strategy,” he said.

 {'title': 'From the Pizzagate Basement to the House Floor: Meet the Conspiracy Caucus',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'There’s a group of bomb throwers on Capitol Hill who are growing more vocal by the day, advocating for everything from impeaching senior justice officials to prosecuting immigration attorneys. Many are members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, but they’ve gone so far down the rabbit hole, this group might as well be called \xa0the Conspiracy Caucus and they are starting to put their theories into actual legislative text.These back bench bomb throwers have always been in Congress, but they were one, maybe two \xa0votes out of 435 and no one really took them seriously. But now as definition of fact has been increasingly bent by the Trump administration, paired with the use of social media to spread fringe theories, mixed with the 24-hour news cycle and the increasingly partisan media landscape has allowed those who used to be constrained to lobbing molotov cocktails from afar to have an audience of millions. Just last week nearly 20 House Republicans unveiled a new bill calling for the appointment of a second special counsel. But \xa0they  aren’t calling for this person  to investigate Russia or potential conflicts of interests in the administration or even the president’s secret payments to one porn star or another.Instead, the group is dead set on uncovering what they argue is the biggest scandal Washington’s ever witnessed: The Clintons. That’s right. The two private citizens who now live in a quiet wooded community in New York, one of whom lost the presidential contest to the man who is now the center of the first special counsel investigation \xa0that’s already produced close to 20 indictments.As they unveiled their legislation, its author Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) began the press conference \xa0with a 15-minute meandering case that touched on everything from the Clinton’s secret deal to sell an American uranium company to a Russian company, Obama’s Department of Justice (Bill Clinton met former Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the tarmac after all) and Special Counsel Robert Mueller—a Republican—who they allege is creating a smokescreen to protect the former first family.“While many in the media and American public have been trying to bring down the president without evidence that President Trump colluded with Russia to win the election, there is a ton of actual evidence of real misconduct that those same people have been attempting to completely sweep under the rug,” Zeldin concluded as the 10 lawmakers in back of him prepared to bolster his case with their own assertions of guilt. \xa0The charges they presented include secret wiretaps, Clinton being cleared by the FBI for using a private server and that James Comey—a Republican who many Democrats blame for delivering the death blow to the Clinton campaign—and others were in the bag for the Clinton campaign that ended more than a year ago. The group of far-right wing lawmakers had a receptive audience on hand to witness them weave an expansive web of Clinton-collusion and misconduct.Jack Posobiec, a vocal Trump supporter who helped propagate the Pizzagate conspiracy that lead to a shooting at a popular family-friendly restaurant in Washington, is now a credentialed member of the congressional press corps after he was hired as a correspondent by One America News Network—a low fi, cable outlet that prides itself on being to the right of Fox News. Their TV camera is set up permanently off the House floor—next to the likes of CNN, MSNBC, ABC and even Fox. This is throughout the day where tea party-tinged members of Congress are given an unadulterated platform to peddle whatever crackpot theories they like. Usually when there’s a vote on the House floor these fringe lawmakers stop by early or come over after they cast their ‘aye’ or ‘nay’ and then get to step on an alt-right soap box that many viewers unwittingly think is now mainstream conservatism. It isn’t. In private more moderate Republicans consider these folks ‘crazy.’ But Washington is crazy these days and seems to be acclimating to Trump’s chaos theory. Posobiec’s presence in the midst of the once vaunted press corps and that of other formerly too-crazy-for-primetime individuals along side actual working reporters is another sign of the indelible imprint the Trump administration is leaving on Washington. Now many of the nation’s policy makers are getting their information from the alt-right—a group that was a fringe Internet movement just two years ago but that now seems to be playing an outsized role in influencing the president’s thoughts and his minions on Capitol Hill.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Some have even claimed that Mueller himself is complicit in a Clinton-Russia bribery scandal (there doesn’t seem to even be a bribery scandal, folks) and that Democrats carry out most mass shootings (they don’t). Still, many of these lawmakers are the new celebrities of the right-wing media machine that critics say has become the defacto mouthpiece, some even say propaganda machine, of the administration. That’s impacting the national policy and the call for a second special counsel seems to be the case and point, because some of these lawmakers are fully prepared for Trump’s campaign rally chorus of “Lock her up!” to become the mantra of the Justice Department."The end game is to have anybody that participated and have their day in court so that a grand jury is formed and indictments if you\'re found guilty then you serve the punishment. And that\'s the key is that we need a criminal prosecution going forward,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) told The Daily Beast.While some of the members pushing this new bill have said they don’t want to see the president’s former political opponent in shackles, others say they’re ready for her signature pant suits to be swapped out for an orange jumpsuit if a grand jury decides she should be indicted. "Losing a political campaign should not function as a de facto immunity deal,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told The Daily Beast. “I mean if people committed crimes we got to know what those were and see if there\'s any lasting consequence from them.”Gaetz is a prime example of the hybrid of conspiracy theorist-legislator. \xa0He notoriously even brought an alt-right troll as his guest to the State of the Union address this year. When asked whether this latest theory that’s the foundation for the call for a second special counsel had a conspiratorial tinge to it, the darling of the alt-right didn’t deny the impression."Well, we live in very strange times,” Gaetz said, without a hint of self-awareness. “I mean it\'s unbelievable that you had the intelligence community weaponized in this way. I think there\'s going to be even more information coming public soon about the intelligence collection on the Trump campaign. I never thought I\'d see that. That is crazy."Critics say the truly crazy thing is actually the symbiotic relationship between the now powerful alt-right media and some of the nation’s most powerful policy makers, including the president himself. “They have an amazing echo chamber…so they just create this alternative reality,” Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), a leader at the Democratic National Convention, told The Daily Beast. “To literally promote a false narrative simply to distract—our First Amendment is imperiled when people do that.”Other conservative voices outside and inside of the Capitol do brush these far right voices aside though without trying to alienate them or their shared base.“People have different motivations for calling for special counsels. A vast majority of them are political," Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told The Daily Beast about this new cabal.But if you tune into what was once conservative media, you now have alt-right voices or backbenchers in Congress masquerading as the mainstream and pretending to speak for the entire party, so many everyday voters aren’t aware that they’re consuming the extreme voices when they’re merely just hungry for information they can trust.Critics say Trump likes it that way and now they fear this could be a trend that’s here to stay.“The way the Trump White House has legitimized “news sources” that are clearly not news is deeply disturbing, and that is something new,” Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) told The Daily Beast. “You did not see previous White Houses validate some of these extreme right wing organizations that are just putting out things that are flat out not true.”'},
 {'title': 'Thank Obama for Trump’s Child Detentions, Immigrant Advocates Say',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Mark it down: This was the weekend a significant portion of the internet discovered that the United States locks up immigrant families. A 2014 story about family detention circulated on Twitter, with many media figures embarrassingly indicating they thought the story was new. Fox News knocked the error, and President Donald Trump tweeted about it too. \xa0The reality is that family detention—the practice of detaining entire family units in special centers designed just for them—is not new. For years, immigrants’ rights advocates have pushed for an end to the practice, which existed during George W. Bush’s presidency and expanded dramatically under President Obama. “They’re both horrible administrations that have abused thousands of children,” said Bryan Johnson, a lawyer who represents children held in detention. Johnson represented a mother detained in Texas who wrote a suicide note before cutting her wrist. He told The Daily Beast that the Obama administration and Trump administration shared the same goal in their immigration policies: trying to discourage people fleeing violence from seeking asylum in the United States. “The purpose of separating the children from the parents is the same goal as the Obama administration, with the idea that they’re going to deter future would-be migrants from coming with their children,” he said. The Obama administration dramatically expanded family detention space after a surge of immigrant mothers and children came to the border in 2014. It was so prevalent that private prison companies have cashed in on the practice. In a 2015 shareholder report, officials with the private prison company CoreCivic—then known as Corrections Corporation of America—boasted that a new contract in Texas to detain mothers and children would boost its yearly revenue by $49 million. On a conference call with reporters on Tuesday morning, White House aide Stephen Miller said family detention is currently at full capacity, and that the biggest impediment to detaining more families is lack of space. If the Trump administration expands the number of beds available in family detention centers, it will be building on Obama’s legacy. “There’s very little difference between President Trump and President Obama with respect to the jailing of refugee children in deportation internment camps,” said Matt Kolken, a lawyer who also represents children seeking asylum in the U.S. “There’s been a systemic assault on the rights of immigrants by both President Obama and President Trump with respect to them using a detained setting as a way to dissuade people from coming to the United States.”The biggest difference between Trump and Obama’s policies toward children, according to lawyers, is that the Trump administration is arresting and prosecuting parents who cross the border illegally with their children, which results in children being separated from their parents and placed in custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. But advocates say the alternative—family detention—is also an inhumane way to treat asylum-seekers and young children. “End family separation, the hashtag, is really odd to me because without family separation, one of the defaults would be family detention and that’s been the hashtag since 2015,” said Andrew Free, a lawyer who focuses on immigrants’ civil rights. “Like so much else in immigration, this administration has taken weapons that Obama’s folks loaded and left on the table on the way out and then they picked these weapons up and started firing, and that’s what’s happened here,” Free continued. “The previous administration created and stood up this infrastructure and refused to demand accountability from the people that were responsible for running it, and now you have its predictable consequence in the hands of this administration.”'},
 {'title': 'FBI First Informed White House of Rob Porter Allegations in March 2017',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A new letter from the Federal Bureau of Investigation released on Thursday casts doubt on White House claims about when they first became aware of abuse accusations against former staff secretary Rob Porter—calling into question the contention that they were only made aware via public reports. The letter, released by Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, indicates that the FBI first alerted White House counsel Donald F. McGahn to some of the allegations as far back as March 2017. “Regarding your request for dates pertaining to Mr. Porter’s background investigation, the following information is provided,” the letter addressed to chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and Cummings reads. “On March 3, 2017, the FBI provided a partial report of investigation addressed to the Counsel to the President, Donald F. McGahn, which contained derogatory information.”It goes on to say: “On July 21, 2017, the FBI submitted a completed background investigation addressed to the EOP Personnel Security Division.” Subsequent to that, the FBI contends, they received a request for additional information in August “to include but not limited to, re-interviews of Mr. Porter, his ex-wives, and his girlfriend at the time.” “On November 1, 2017, the FBI submitted a completed investigative report addressed to the EOP Personnel Security Division, which contained additional derogatory information,” the letter continues. “On January 3, 2017, the FBI’s investigative file was administratively closed.\xa0 Following its closing of the background investigation, the FBI received additional information, which was provided in a memorandum addressed to the EOP Personnel Security Operations on February 7,\xa02018.”Porter resigned in February, amid extended controversy, during which time the White House struggled to describe the extent of their knowledge about the allegations he physically abused his two ex-wives. Initially, Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Porter but the White House contended that Kelly’s position changed once he saw images purportedly showing the abuse of Porter’s former partners. Cummings charged that the White House has not given over documents that Gowdy requested and also criticized the chairman for not issuing a subpoena as a result. “The FBI has now confirmed that it repeatedly provided derogatory information to the White House about Rob Porter as far back as March of 2017,” Cummings said in a statement. “But White House officials ignored this information and continued granting Porter access to our nation's most highly classified secrets—just as they with Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner.”"},
 {'title': 'Michael Flynn and Son Met With Russia Ambassador Before RT Gala',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Before traveling to Russia in 2015 for a dinner hosted by a propaganda network, retired Gen. Michael Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., went to the home of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak for a private meeting.That was just one of several findings in a new, long-awaited report from House intelligence committee Republicans that was released on Friday morning. The report, which is more than 250 pages long, has been overshadowed by the often-acrimonious process that marked its construction. And the findings will likely become fodder for additional partisan bickering rather than a helpful addition to the historical record of the 2016 election. \xa0The report does take the Russian government to task for meddling in that contest. But it questions the Intelligence Community’s conclusion that the Kremlin wanted Trump to win. Shortly after its release, President Donald Trump touted the report on Twitter. But the report includes a stern criticism of his campaign for praising Wikileaks and a debunking of a favorite talking point among the president’s defenders: The report confirms that the investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin began with then-foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos––not with the so-called Steele dossier. “The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an enterprise counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign after receiving information related to Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos,” the report says. It notes that Papadopoulos met in London with people who claimed to be linked to the Kremlin, and tried to set up meetings between Kremlin officials and people on the campaign. Because of the Papadopoulos investigation, the report continues, the FBI started an individual counterintelligence probe into Carter Page––who was “already a subject of interest for the FBI.” Page, a foreign policy adviser of sorts to the Trump campaign, was in touch with “known Russian intelligence officers” and helped the FBI prosecute Russian intelligence officials. The report also looks at the use of the Steele dossier, which Hillary Clinton’s campaign paid to produce, in the FBI’s application for a warrant to surveil Page. That fact has been a central focus for the president’s defenders, some of whom try to argue that the entire Russian investigation was a set-up by the Clinton campaign. While critics of the president have pointed to the actions of Page and Papadopoulos as evidence of the Trump campaign trying to establish some form of contact with Russian officials, Republicans on the House Intel committee came to a different conclusion. The pro-Russia views of those respective advisers is not seen as an extension of Trump’s publicly professed affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin but as the result of the conservative foreign policy establishment’s shunning of Trump. “The Republican national security establishment\'s opposition to candidate Trump created opportunities for two less-experienced individuals with pro-Russia views to serve as campaign advisors,” the report reads, citing Page and Papadopoulos. To bolster this claim, the report references an open letter to Trump that was published in the national security journal War On The Rocks, in which top Republican former foreign policy officials said Trump, as president, would “act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world.”The report’s authors swipe at those former officials by characterizing them as “self-described ‘GOP National Security Leaders’" and use the publication of that letter as evidence that the campaign had to “turn elsewhere for support.” The report fails to mention, however, that authors of the open letter shunned Trump explicitly because of his pro-Russia tendencies. In a list of objections, the GOP security heavyweights cited Trump’s “admiration for foreign dictators such as Vladimir Putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world’s greatest democracy” as a specific cause for concern. The House Intel report also downplays the outreach that Alexander Nix, the now-suspended CEO of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, made to Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign (overtures first reported by The Daily Beast). The report says that, at the time, Cambridge Analytica had not started working for the Trump campaign. It does not note the firm’s close connections to the powerful Mercer family, who generously funded an outside super PAC that boosted Trump’s campaign. It also does not note that Cambridge Analytica subsequently worked for the Mercers’ super PAC. The report notes that Donald Trump Jr. exchanged DMs with Wikileaks on Twitter, and criticizes the campaign for praising Wikileaks.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“The Committee also found the Trump campaign\'s periodic praise for andcommunications with Wikileaks-a hostile foreign organization-to be highly objectionable and inconsistent with U.S. national security interests,” the report says. Democrats on the House Intel Committee have universally objected to both the report’s conclusions and the timing of its release. Democratic members have argued that more interviews were needed to get a fuller picture of Russia’s role in the election. They also have been incensed at the willingness of the report’s authors to take witnesses at their word when they say they didn’t collude with the Kremlin.According to the report, none of the witnesses who testified before the committee said they had evidence of collusion. Jared Kushner told the committee that the campaign “did not collude, cooperate, whatever other \'C\' words you used, with any foreign governments.” “When asked directly, none of the interviewed witnesses provided evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government,” the report says. In a statement, the committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), said Republicans ignored “evidence of collusion” that was in “plain sight.”“In fact, we found evidence of collusion in the abundant secret meetings and communications between Trump campaign officials and associates such as Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Donald Trump Jr., Michael Flynn, Carter Page, and others, with emissaries and officials from, or linked to the Russian government,” Schiff said. “The Trump campaign and Administration’s efforts to deny, conceal and, when discovered, misrepresent what took place in these interactions with the Russians is powerful evidence of a consciousness of wrongdoing.”Democrats say their investigation efforts will continue. But without Republican cooperation there are limits to what type of additional information they can access and witnesses they can call. With the formal release of the House committee’s findings, the Senate Intelligence Committee becomes the lone congressional body still looking into electoral collusion. Beyond that, there is now broad agreement that the only investigative effort with the resources to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 is the one helmed by Special Counsel Bob Mueller. '},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Reince Priebus—nine months after he was ousted from his chief of staff role at the Trump White House—is still on message, and in denial that there is or was anything amiss at the White House. Priebus spoke at an event hosted by Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, and reflected on his time in the “chaotic” West Wing—admitting that he sometimes got “caught in the crossfire,” and was careful not to mentioning the conflicts currently raging inside the West Wing. He did not address his own ritual humiliation during his tenure as chief of staff (culminating with one of the first firing by tweet of the administration) instead he stuck to praising the president’s style, governance and even his Twitter feed. When asked if he thought that the president adds into the anxiety surrounding government institutions, Priebus claimed that President Trump tapped “into what voter thinks about institutions.”“What they think about the EPA and [the Department of the] Interior, it’s not good,” Priebus said. “They don’t like it. They think they waste money, and they have to pay for things to do nothing for their life.” He failed to mention that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been mired in scandal for weeks, starting with his $50-a-night Capitol Hill rental, and progressing towards his allegedly unnecessary spending habits—including federally funded flights back to his hometown and his alleged practice of punishing underlings who questioned his spending.Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has been scrutinized for mixing official travel (and their expenses) with political events. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson also was recently grilled for his purchase of a $31,000 mahogany dining set for his office.Priebus also said that Trump wasn’t necessarily adding to the anxiety of major institutions, but he was simply “forcing every department to look at itself.” For example, he mentioned hiring freezes—which he sees “as a caring of these institutions.” The State Department hiring freeze was highly scrutinized when it was put in place, and is said to have inflicted damage to the agency after former Secretary of State Tillerson rolled it back in February.One recently retired diplomat told Foreign Policy that it “still left the department worse off than it was before the hiring freeze. You don’t get to call a partial fix of a self-inflicted gunshot wound a win.”He had more rosy words for the chaos in the White House, particularly about tariffs. He said that the internal debate “slowed things down,” but Trump eventually grew tiresome of the back-and-forth.“You should be comforted that there are people in front of president who are arguing tooth and nail, that are arguing [tariffs are] bad,” Priebus told the crowd. “Gary Cohn was making those arguments, but in spite of his best efforts, he went to the other side… [Trump] got sick of hearing people out, and returned to default position.” Priebus was steadfast in his praise for Trump throughout the short talk. Despite him attempting to get the president to toss Twitter while he was still in Trump’s orbit, he talked up Trump’s “unique brand.” He claimed the president has “been good for party,” and returned the GOP “to party that thinks the American worker is worth fighting for.”He also said that no one in this generation could replicate what Trump did in 2016, musing that maybe another candidate “in 30 years” will turn to Trumpian tactics in campaigning—but no one could trump Trump right now. As far as the 2020 elections are concerned, Priebus has his pick made.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

I said, ‘If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.’”Biden, who is often discussed as a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, went on to refer to Trump’s infamous “locker-room talk” excuse for his vulgar words about women. “I’ve been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life,” Biden said. “I’m a pretty damn good athlete.” He quipped: “Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room.”This is not the first time Biden has spoken about Trump in these particularly aggressive terms. In October 2016, shortly after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape, the then-veep similarly said he’d fight Trump if the two were classmates. “The press always asks me, don’t I wish I were debating him?" Biden said at a rally for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “No, I wish I were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish.”And then, while addressing Trump bragging about nonconsensually groping women, Biden was even more repulsed. “What he said he did and does is the textbook definition of sexual assault,” he said at the time. “Think about this: it\'s more than wrong, he said because I’m famous, because I’m a star, because I’m a billionaire, I can do things other people can’t. What a disgusting assertion for anyone to make.”'},
 {'title': 'Fox Military Guest: Torture Is Good, ‘It Worked on John McCain’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "According to a frequent Fox Business Network military commentator, torture is good because it worked on Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).McCain, who was tortured while a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has been outspoken in opposing Gina Haspel, President Trump’s pro-torture nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.Appearing Thursday morning on the Fox Business Network, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney took an ugly swipe at McCain for his opposition to torture, telling Varney & Co. host Charles Payne: “The fact is, is John McCain—it worked on John. That’s why they call him ‘Songbird John.’“The fact is those methods can work, and they are effective, as former Vice President Cheney said,” McInerney continued, in a clip first spotted by Media Matters. “And if we have to use them to save a million American lives, we will do whatever we have to.”Contrary to McInerney’s claim, however, there is no evidence McCain ever gave up accurate information while being tortured in North Vietnam. In fact, the senator wrote in one of his books, “Pressed for more useful information, I gave the names of the Green Bay Packers’ offensive line, and said they were members of my squadron.”Experienced interrogators frequently cite that story as a demonstration of how ineffective torture is in producing reliable information.Hours after the segment aired, Payne released a statement apologizing to the McCain family. “This morning on a show I was hosting, a guest made a very false and derogatory remark about Senator John McCain. At the time, I had the control room in my ear telling me to wrap the segment, and did not hear the comment. I regret I did not catch this remark, as it should have been challenged. As a proud military veteran and son of a Vietnam Vet these words neither reflect my or the network’s feelings about Senator McCain, or his remarkable service and sacrifice to this country.”McInerney, once a top TV pitchman for President George W. Bush’s Iraq War, recently served as a paid analyst on Fox News. He is no longer in that position, but continues to make frequent appearances across both Fox News and Fox Business, and has a penchant for outlandish claims related to military and foreign policy.The former number-three commander of the Air Force was a frequent source of birther conspiracies about President Obama, often suggesting he was secretly a radical Muslim. “I feel I have an obligation to the American people to be a part of the discourse and discuss these important national security issues because they are complex, especially on radical Islam,” McInerney told The Daily Beast shortly before appearing at a 2016 Trump rally. “As a nation we have not had it. We have a president that has suppressed it.”McInerney also infamously claimed on Fox News that missing passenger jet MH370 was actually hijacked by terrorists and flown to Pakistan to be used for jihadist activities.More recently, in late 2017, while appearing on Fox News star Sean Hannity’s radio show, McInerney dismissed the host’s concerns about how “millions could potentially die” in a U.S. war with North Korea: “Yeah, but they’ll be mostly North Koreans,” the retired lieutenant general said.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Don Blankenship is not going away quietly, much to the dismay of Republican leadership who have high hopes of defeating incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) in November. On Monday, the former coal executive announced his intent to run in West Virginia’s U.S. Senate race on the Constitution Party line, pitting him against Manchin and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who won the Republican nomination against Blankenship nearly two weeks ago. “It is especially appropriate for me to be nominated by the Constitution Party given its staunch and uncompromising commitment to upholding the United States Constitution,” Blankenship said in a statement. “My First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendment rights were violated when I was falsely charged and politically imprisoned\xa0following\xa0the\xa0unfortunate\xa0mining accident at Upper Big Branch—a tragedy wholly caused by the actions of the establishment and the federal government,” Blankenship said, referring to the death of 29 miners during a 2010 explosion at a mine his company owned. \xa0“It\xa0is no surprise then that the establishment has worked so hard to cover-up the truth. In fact, were it not for the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a jury trial the Obama Department of Justice would have tyrannically and maliciously imprisoned me for life.”Blankenship, who has refused to endorse Morrisey and ran a bizarre and racist campaign in which he railed against “Cocaine Mitch” McConnell and his “China family,” would have to overcome a “sore loser” clause in West Virginia’s state law to be on the ballot in November. “Candidates affiliated with a recognized political party who run for election in a primary election and who lose the nomination cannot change her or his voter registration to a minor party organization/unaffiliated candidate to take advantage of the later filing deadlines and have their name on the subsequent general election ballot,” the clause in the Secretary of State's guidebook for running campaigns in 2018 reads. Blankenship suggested on Monday that he'd be willing to fight this in court however, causing more headaches as the campaign goes on. “Although\xa0the establishment will likely begin their efforts against us by mounting a legal challenge to my candidacy, we are confident that—if challenged—our legal position will prevail, absent a politically motivated decision by the courts,” he said.

 {'title': 'Nikki Haley, Great Pushback. Now Resign on Principle.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Nikki Haley slapped back hard at White House minions after they first suggested that her announcement of new sanctions against Russia was premature and then said it might have been the result of “momentary confusion.” She tweeted late Tuesday afternoon: “With all due respect, I don’t get confused.”As ambassador to the United Nations, Haley probably doesn’t get to watch a lot of movies, even Oscar nominees. In this fraught and uncertain world, that’s normally a \xa0job in which you expect to be woken up at 3 a.m. In  blowup-a-minute Trump World, that’s a job that knows no sleep.But if she hasn’t seen Jordan Peele’s masterwork (so far), she should rent it tonight and do exactly what the title says: Get Out. Now.At the UN on April 9, Haley said Russia had the “blood of Syrian children” on its hands.Then on Sunday, a forceful Haley said on CBS’ Face the Nation that more sanctions against Russia were on the way. This time, she said, Russian companies found to have aided the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad in producing chemical weapons would be punished. Haley said an announcement from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin would be forthcoming on Monday.“Get out and show that America still has leaders whose outrage at the slaughter of innocents will not be silenced.”Instead, when Monday rolled around, Press Secretary and Walker-Back-in-Chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders disarmed that threat, saying: “We are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future.” And Tuesday, the Palm Beach White House sent out new chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow to opine that Haley had gotten “ahead of the curve.”Why Kudlow? Who knows? But presumably he wasn’t referring to the Laffer Curve of which he is so fond. Anyway, after Haley’s forceful tweet, Kudlow quickly apologized and ate a helping of crow.So where does that leave Haley? Sitting behind her nameplate at the UN with her legs cut off, staring at the remains of the credibility she has worked so hard to establish since she was unexpectedly named to represent America at the increasingly hostile world forum.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

As governor of South Carolina, she first supported the candidacy of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and when he flamed out, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).As early as the January 2016, when Haley delivered the Republican rebuttal to President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address, this daughter of Indian immigrants made reference to Trump’s inflammatory campaign-trail rhetoric. She said: \xa0"During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country."The next month, right before the South Carolina primary, Haley said that Trump was “everything a governor doesn’t want in a President.”Still despite trading barbs—candidate Trump called her weak on immigration and an embarrassment to the people of South Carolina—and despite any demonstrable international expertise, Haley took the UN post offered her, presumably because she saw it as a stepping stone.In the past year, she has worked hard to overcome whatever shortfalls she may have had in foreign policy experience and shown herself to be a credible and no-nonsense voice for America.She has also shown herself to be what many saw when she was governor—presidential timber.Like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), the 46-year-old Haley represents a younger generation of politicians who could have a shot at being the first woman president. That could happen as early as 2020 if Trump declines to run again or (a more remote possibility) has his presidency upended by special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation or by the still-developing probe of his lawyer Michael Cohen by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Or it might not even take that: Tuesday morning, Joe Scarborough said on MSNBC that he thought Haley could beat Trump in a GOP primary in 2020.So far, Haley has kept a high profile at the UN while avoiding the sleaze und drama of the Trump White House. She has maintained her dignity and that of the country under trying circumstances. But she is at a tipping point.Haley has talked tough since she arrived at the UN saying, “For those who don’t have our backs, we’re taking names.” One of the names she has frequently taken is Russia, and she has consistently said she believes Moscow meddled in the U.S. elections.But if Haley allows herself to be upended by Trump and his lieutenants over chemical-weapons-related sanctions, she will be seen as a paper tiger and, worse, a stooge of the Russia-loving President and, indeed, of the Kremlin itself.Already, Haley has shown that she is not a pushover. But one tweet is not enough.Now is the time for Haley to do the hard thing—but the right thing for the country and for herself: Get out and show that America still has leaders whose outrage at the slaughter of innocents will not be silenced. Get out before her very bright future is sullied by the Trump Taint. Of course, it will be hard for Haley to give up her post and her bully pulpit, but in the space of 16 months, she has burnished her executive skills and added foreign policy chops. She can walk away to a think tank, a foundation or an academic post with her head held high while she bides her time and considers her next moves—one of which should be introducing herself to more of America.

 {'title': 'Gina Haspel, Trump’s Pick to Lead the CIA, ‘Ran the Interrogation Program,’ Former CIA Lawyer Wrote',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Long before Donald Trump ever nominated Gina Haspel to run the CIA, a memoir from a former CIA top attorney contained a line with the power to do serious damage to her chances. Haspel’s informal nomination ran into immediate jeopardy last month over her 2002 supervision of the agency’s first secret black-site prison, located in Thailand, where two early detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri, were tortured. (She directly ran the black site, though after Zubaydah’s most intense period of torture that year.) But in his 2014 book, John Rizzo, a longtime senior CIA lawyer, indicated that Haspel was responsible for the incommunicado detention and torture not of two men, but of dozens, potentially. Former intelligence officials interviewed by The Daily Beast have portrayed Haspel’s experience similarly. Rizzo, in his memoir, Company Man, looked back on his time in a Langley controversy he likened to “a big turd dumped on my desk”: the fateful November 2005 decision, made by Haspel’s then-boss Jose Rodriguez with her support, to destroy 92 videotapes depicting the 2002 torture of Zubaydah and al-Nashiri. Rizzo wrote that Rodriguez’s then-chief of staff—who was Haspel, though he didn’t name her, as her identity was then an official secret—was deeply involved in the agency’s torture program. “Jose installed as his chief of staff an officer from the Counterterrorist Center who had previously run the interrogation program,” Rizzo wrote. That’s a substantially broader declaration than the history already dogging Haspel, the agency’s deputy director, whom the White House formally nominated as its next CIA director late on Tuesday. It would be years before Rizzo’s passage caused any controversy. The CIA did not challenge it when it was published. (The book went through the CIA’s pre-publication review, though that only inspects for classified information and isn’t a fact-check.) But asked about it on Wednesday, with Haspel’s role in interrogations still a high-stakes official secret, the agency disputed Rizzo’s characterization.“Much of the public narrative about Deputy Director Haspel’s career is inaccurate, including this specific claim,” said CIA spokesperson Ryan Trapani.“Gina Haspel is one of the most qualified persons nominated to be CIA Director. She’s a tested and respected leader who will lead consistent with our mission, expertise, values, and the law.”Rizzo, who was acting CIA general counsel during much of the time the torture program occurred, insisted that the passage was correct then—and is still right today.“All I can say is that I stand by everything I wrote in my book about the tapes episode, and no one from the Agency has asked me to correct anything I wrote,” Rizzo told The Daily Beast. He did not answer follow-up questions.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The sudden dispute underscores the precariousness of Haspel’s potential directorship. Haspel, a three-decade CIA officer, faces enormous obstacles in the Senate, where intelligence committee members are demanding substantial disclosure of her involvement in post-9/11 renditions, detentions and interrogations. Much of Haspel’s background during the torture program, as well as her specific role in it, remains classified. “To the best of my understanding, she ran the interrogation program... Her becoming director absolutely terrifies me. Once I heard her name, I immediately thought, ‘Oh, God.’”— former CIA official“[T]he more we review the classified facts, the more disturbed we are,” three key Democratic senators on the panel, Dianne Feinstein—who led the committee’s years-long torture inquiry—Ron Wyden, and Martin Heinrich wrote to CIA Director Mike Pompeo on Monday (PDF). They said they were disturbed “both by the actions she has taken during her career and by the CIA’s failure to allow the public the opportunity to consider them.” Wyden followed up in a USA Today interview Tuesday charging the CIA with a “cover-up” of Haspel’s torture record, adding that his concerns about her are “are significantly broader than what has been alleged in the press.” Declassified documents and Daily Beast sources indicate that Haspel joined the agency’s Counterterrorism Center shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Rodriguez, then the self-proclaimed “chief operations officer” who began running the center in May 2002, writes in his book of taking over a “superstar” woman to whom he assigned the cover name “Jane.” Rodriguez “had her head one of our earliest ‘black sites,’” he writes in his 2011 memoir, Hard Measures. In a biographical detail that corresponds to the public record about Haspel’s career, “later she became my right arm as chief of staff when I led the clandestine service.” That was in November 2004, when Rodriguez became the CIA’s deputy director for operations, a job that got a name change to head of the National Clandestine Service. While it’s not exactly clear when Haspel left the Counterterrorism Center to rejoin her mentor, Haspel remained at the Center in 2003 and 2004, the period during which CTC was most intensely involved in torture. Rodriguez did not respond to messages seeking comment about Haspel. His co-author, Bill Harlow, a former senior aide to CIA Director George Tenet, said he had “no reason to disbelieve anything [Rodriguez] wrote.” But Harlow added he wasn’t in a position to discuss Haspel’s agency tenure. “I’m not specifically aware of the exact timing of her various assignments and couldn’t talk about it if I were. As far as I know the agency hasn’t declassified it,” Harlow told The Daily Beast. But the specifics of Haspel’s involvement in interrogations is now a frontburner issue for the Senate intelligence committee, and a test for both the committee and the agency about the legacy of torture now that Donald Trump, who has expressed enthusiasm for torture, is president. This isn’t the first time that legacy has been a problem for Haspel. In 2013, she was unable to take her old boss Rodriguez’s position in 2013. At the time, a knowledgeable former CIA official recalled, there was confusion and surprise that someone with Haspel’s background in torture could have been a credible candidate for such a senior position. “To the best of my understanding, she ran the interrogation program,” the official said. “Her becoming director absolutely terrifies me,” continued the former CIA official. “Once I heard her name, I immediately thought, ‘Oh, God.’” Back then, in a story first reported by The New York Times, Feinstein—then the Senate committee chair—made it clear to then-director John Brennan that she objected to Haspel leading the CIA’s clandestine service. Brennan chose another chief.But by 2017, those obstacles to Haspel had shrunk, apparently. Trump tapped Haspel to be deputy director of the CIA. And despite an attempted deposition of her by two contractor psychologists who designed the torture program, the opposition to that elevation was relatively muted.“[T]he more we review the classified facts, the more disturbed we are... both by the actions she has taken during her career and by the CIA’s failure to allow the public the opportunity to consider them.”— Three Democratic senatorsOver the past month, the CIA and its senior alumni have attempted to redefine Haspel after her impending nomination saw a wave of critical coverage over her role in torture. The agency permitted the release of saccharine biographical details to reporters, like her affinities for Johnny Cash and University of Kentucky basketball, while shedding no light on her history with renditions, detentions, or so-called enhanced interrogations. The agency portrayed her as a gender pioneer whose thwarted ambition to attend West Point, at the time closed to women cadets, would be avenged by her ascension as the agency’s first women director. Its public-affairs department blasted this out to reporters with the subject line, “CIA Introduces Gina Haspel to the American People.”Haspel, if confirmed, would be the first director to rise from the CIA’s operational ranks with uninterrupted service since William Colby in 1973\u200d, which helps explain her depth of support from within the agency. But she’s also the first potential director from the CIA generation involved in post-9/11 torture, making her nomination inescapably a referendum on a dark period of history that the agency wants definitively resolved and human rights advocates say demands vastly more accountability than it’s received. (That’s another uncomfortable parallel with Colby’s tenure.) “If Ms. Haspel is confirmed, it will send a terrible message to the world broadly, and to the officers of the CIA more superficially,” a former U.S. intelligence official said. “The CIA, and its former officers, are pushing so hard for Ms. Haspel to be director because if she’s confirmed, it essentially exonerates her, the CIA and all of these former senior CIA officials from their involvement in or their defense of the torture program.” UPDATE 5/9/18: In an email to The Daily Beast after the publication of this story, Rizzo wrote, “Upon further reflection, I want to make clear that I never intended to suggest in my book that Gina Haspell [sic] was in charge of CIA’s interrogation program. She was not. I have nothing further to say on this subject other than to stress that I fully support her nomination to be CIA Director.” Rizzo would not say why his mind had suddenly changed, or whether there were other parts of his book that he was now abandoning. During her Senate confirmation hearing, Haspel said, “I did not run the interrogation department. In fact, I was not even read into the interrogation program until it had been up and running for a year.”But that statement defies plain logic. Haspel was in charge of a secret prison while torture took place—not even the CIA disputes that. How could she not have known about a program that she helped execute? "},
 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt’s Lobbyist Landlord Charged Twice as Much to Another GOP Lawmaker',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The lobbyist-owned condo where Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt stayed at a steep discount is now causing political headaches for another Republican lawmaker. Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID) admitted to federal regulators Thursday that he failed to disclose expenses associated with political fundraisers held at the same townhouse where Pruitt stayed for just $50 a night. Crapo’s leadership PAC told the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday that it had reimbursed a company owned by Vicki Hart, the wife of energy lobbyist and Pruitt donor J. Steven Hart, for three fundraising events held at their Capitol Hill rowhouse.The reimbursement came after a watchdog group filed a complaint with the FEC last week alleging that Crapo’s fundraising events constituted illegal in-kind contributions to his campaign by the LLC that technically owns the house. Corporations are legally barred from contributing to federal political campaigns.Crapo’s campaign said it reimbursed the company $300 for use of the house for three events, after Vicki Hart informed them that she charges $100 for rental of the event space. Though fundraisers are inherently different than room rentals, the bill for Crapo raises additional questions about the one for Pruitt. The EPA administrator has insisted that he was paid market rate for his room—a rate that turns out to be half what the same landlord charged for a fundraising event at the same location. Pruitt’s time staying in the house, for a few months early in his tenure at the EPA, is one of a number of controversies dogging the administrator as he heads to Capitol Hill today for a pair of congressional budget hearings.In a 23-page memo provided to some members of Congress ahead of those hearings, and obtained by The Daily Beast on Thursday, Pruitt’s staff pushes back on all of those controversies. Regarding the Harts’ house, they stated that ethics staff had cleared the living arrangement, that the $50 per night he paid was above market rate, and that J. Steven Hart had indeed met with Pruitt while renting him a room, but that Pruitt was acting in his “personal capacity” at the time.Despite the pushback, the controversy has taken a political toll on Pruitt, who is expected to be grilled on his living arrangements at Thursday’s hearings. It’s also swept up the Harts. J. Steven Hart resigned this week from the lobbying firm where he’d worked for years, Williams & Jensen.'},
 {'title': '‘Repeatedly Drunk’ Ronny Jackson’s VA Nomination Is on Life Support',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, is facing pressure to drop his bid amid concern that potentially damaging allegations from his past service could create an embarrassing public spectacle. Two sources familiar with the proceedings on Capitol Hill tell The Daily Beast that lawmakers have been instructed to no longer push for Jackson’s confirmation after allegations surfaced that he was hostile to co-workers, struggled with alcohol use, and over-prescribed medications during his time in the Navy and during his tenure as the White House physician. A third source told The Daily Beast that lawmakers are particularly hung up on the fact that there are numerous allegations of repeat behavior on Jackson’s part—not isolated incidents.Later Tuesday, Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, confirmed the nature of the allegations. In an interview with NPR, he said more than 20 military employees contacted the committee about Jackson. Their allegations focused mainly on Jackson’s actions while on official business abroad.“We were told stories where he was repeatedly drunk on while duty where his main job was to take care of the most powerful man in the world. That’s not acceptable,” Tester said, adding that Jackson was allegedly verbally “abusive” toward staff members and “belittle[d] the people underneath him.”The senator later said in a CNN interview that Jackson was referred to as the “candy man” because he “handed out prescription drugs like they were candy.” Those substances included Ambien and Provigil, according to Tester.Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) told reporters “a significant number” of Jackson’s former colleagues had come forward to investigators and individual senators with concerns about Jackson in recent days.“I don’t know what’s true, but I do know that all kinds of people are coming forward and that should have given the White House some pause of this nomination,” he said. “I don’t know if they are whistleblowers... They are people that knew him or know him, have worked with him in the military and former military that are willing to talk to investigators about him.”He added, “Why wasn’t the White House doing that?”Asked about his beleaguered nominee on Tuesday, Trump reaffirmed that he stood behind Jackson, calling him “one of the finest people that I have met.” But he all but openly pleaded with him to drop his bid, suggesting that the political pressure to do so was both untenable and unfair.“If I were him—in many ways I’d love to be him—I wouldn’t do it,” Trump said when asked about the prospect of Jackson soldiering on.Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearing, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was formally postponed on Tuesday as lawmakers continue to review the allegations—giving off the impression that the nomination was all but dead.“I think it’s gone, unfortunately, because anytime things go backward like this and there is a postponement of a hearing, the support has come unwound,” said Rick Weidman, Executive Director for Policy and Government Affairs at Vietnam Veterans of America. “I’ve met him a couple times. I didn’t get a chance to say I know him well. People who knew him from his role at the White House say he is a great guy and a good physician. But that does not necessarily a good secretary make.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Tester said he still had information to review, including an FBI report which he planned to read Tuesday afternoon. He said later that the FBI file “appears to be fine.” Asked whether the nomination was still viable, Tester said: “We are still working on the vetting.”While Tester hadn’t spoken with Jackson since the information came to light, Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), a member of the committee, met with the admiral in his office on Tuesday. There was no indication that Jackson was preparing to withdraw, Moran said. Jackson also addressed one of the allegations, according to Moran, who said Jackson assured him that he has never had a drink while on the job.“To me, these are allegations—perhaps something that somebody said—but nobody has come forward to me or, as far as I know, nobody has sat in front of the committee and told us, ‘here are the problems with this nominee,’” Moran said.At the White House, senior officials, including top aides on legislative strategy, were left scrambling on Tuesday. An emergency meeting was held in the morning to discuss next steps and how much pressure they should apply on the congressional side to salvage Jackson’s nomination, according to two administration officials. One official noted that while the position of the White House is to stand firm on Jackson for now, efforts to prop up him up could “implode” at any moment this week, given the internal concerns and their read of the political landscape.Later Tuesday, the White House indicated it was sticking with Jackson, suggesting that the allegations against him were being driven by disgruntled former employees.“He has improved unit morale, received glowing reviews and promotions under Republican and Democrat presidents, and has been given a clean vet from the FBI,” a senior administration official said. “He has never even been the subject of an Inspector General review and he will certainly not be railroaded by a bitter ex-colleague who was removed from his job.”The administration pointed to former President Barack Obama’s handwritten praise of Jackson in his medical reports, in addition to a Controlled Substance Inventory Board audit of the White House medical team which it says “confirms Dr. Jackson’s medicinal prescriptions were completely appropriate.”Jackson was an unexpected choice to lead the VA. He had never run a bureaucracy larger than a few dozen employees. What he lacked in experience, however, he made up with gravitas. Trump was reportedly smitten with how Jackson performed when discussing the president’s physical—which Jackson conducted—at the White House briefing room. And the pair got along well during their meeting to discuss the VA vacancy. But Jackson had few allies outside of the president. The major veterans groups approached his nomination skeptically, and lawmakers on the Hill complained that they had not been consulted in advance and had limited understanding of Jackson’s managerial philosophies when it came to veterans’ care. Key players on veterans issues on and around Capitol Hill said they had never even met Jackson prior to his nomination, and found the manner in which he was chosen to be concerning.“I have very serious questions that need to be addressed, and they should be addressed right now. Like today,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), a senior member of the committee. “And the White House needs to be forthcoming. It has been really careless, maybe even negligent about vetting with a number of these nominations. And it probably needs to take steps to correct those deficiencies.”Tester and Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), the chairman of the veterans’ affairs committee, sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday asking for information on “improper conduct,” giving off few hints that they’re pining for a confirmation hearing to proceed.“I’m very happy with what I know, and I think I’m pretty happy with what I don’t know,” Isakson told reporters.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), meanwhile, deferred to his deputy and the White House when asked about Jackson’s future. “We’re going to wait and see what the administration and Chairman Isakson recommends,” he said."},

In the future, Russia and other authoritarians will continue their manipulation, but it will be ordinary candidates and their campaigns, lobbyists, and corporate backers that seek to exploit the manipulative advantages available on social media. A combative tech CEO just might flip the script and call out the politicians for their role in this mess. In 2008, President Obama beat the establishment in part by harnessing social media. The Obama campaign successfully used online networks to create real world votes, and everyone ran to follow and duplicate their methods. Fast forward eight years into the social media era, and we’ve found out from whistleblower Christopher Wylie, and Channel 4’s undercover expose that Cambridge Analytica took e-campaigns to the logical next step. They aggregated more than 80 million Facebook users’ data to analyze and then deliver customized messages to the right voters at exactly the right time. Cambridge Analytica’s CEO Alexander Nix eerily bragged about mimicking the Kremlin’s playbook during a covertly filmed business meeting. Nix explained how his company, working through a series of cutouts and front companies, could create physical provocations in the real world, such as the employment of Ukrainian sex workers, to discredit political opponents in the virtual world. The company’s investors and board members include Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer and Steve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News, one-time adviser to President Trump, and hero of nationalist audiences from America to Europe. Subsequent revelations say Bannon used Cambridge Analytica to test populist narratives on social media, such as “Drain the Swamp” and “Deep State,” as far back as 2014.Trolling-as-a-service, one stop shops for analyzing, engaging, and mobilizing online audiences, will be a method all political campaigns seek to exploit in the future. Just think about what a political campaign needs: a deep insight into voter demographics and desires, voter preferences and dislikes; key emotional vulnerabilities constituents didn’t even know they possess; the ability to efficiently spend advertising on specific voting blocs; the rapid creation of engaged audiences for a newly formed campaign; and the ability to destroy a political foe with information attacks while hiding the hand of the attacker. The world shouldn’t be surprised Cambridge Analytica moved to offer the precursor to trolling-as-a-service. We should instead be surprised that it’s the only one we know about to date.\xa0Political campaigns recognize this need, and it’s no wonder that Brad Parscale, President Trump’s digital campaign leader in 2016 who smartly brought Facebook directly into his efforts, has been elevated to campaign manager for 2020. The Kremlin honed the first generation of trolling by advancing several novel concepts. Above all, they seamlessly integrated hacking and influence, two disciplines that largely sat apart or when used in combination pursued only tactical discrediting campaigns. When APT 28, Fancy Bear, and APT 29, Cozy Bear, hackers from Russia’s intelligence services, launched their cyberassaults on thousands of targets in 2015, their intended strategic purpose was to influence the presidential election a year later. Russia’s trolls also mastered workflow in ways previous propagandists had not. In multiple regions and languages, around the clock, the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin’s social media propaganda cutout indicted this past February by special counsel Robert Mueller, created layered social influence by crafting stripped out blogs, deployed waves of human-operated false accounts, and even fashioned shareable memes and graphics tailored to individual audiences (PDF). The Internet Research Agency advanced the content of Russia’s state sponsored news outlets under a veil of plausible deniability. Most importantly, the Kremlin enlisted witting and unwitting virtual allies, securing the cooperation and in some cases allegiance of foreign audiences they persistently nudge after any single election.The Kremlin ignited the social media trolling tidal wave, and now many other authoritarians have pursued it. In only the first year after the 2016 presidential election, authoritarians in Myanmar, Cambodia, and Philippines aggressively employed social media to suppress their adversaries, distribute false and manipulated news, and distort reality through virtual trolling. Social media information campaigns employed by leaders of developing nations remain a bit basic in their methods, relying more on art than science. But authoritarians aren’t the ones the world should worry about most. Their technical know-how remains limited, and for the most part, they don’t have the resources and methods for acquiring the best social media manipulation technology. Cambridge Analytica’s approach appears to have advanced the Kremlin’s playbook by applying more science to their art, aggregating voluminous personal data and then employing greater computational power to more rapidly and effectively influence audiences on scale. Cambridge Analytica’s second generation trolling and\xa0claimed offerings are as much aspirational as reality, a touch of digital snake oil perhaps, but their vision is on target. Cambridge Analytica is really just the beta version of trolling-as-a-service.If left unchecked, politicians and their political parties, Super PAC’s, lobbyists, and corporate public relations firms will seek out “trolling-as-a-service” to dominate the information space toward their advantage but to the detriment of society.\xa0Western political campaigns can garner far more resources and apply them for the best available information warfare services. Even further, they can and will sustain their campaigns over an enduring period, persistently engaging and sustaining their audiences, campaigning relentlessly regardless of the candidate, who may be substituted between elections. Great reward will come to the entrepreneur with enough startup capital to harvest and correlate large amounts of personal data on distinguishable voting blocs and then mine those details rapidly and incisively by employing machine learning. From there, rented troll farms will deploy sophisticated computational propaganda to alter the information environment and employ humans to act as for-hire propagandists advancing their client’s message and tackling their client’s adversaries. Trolling-as-a-service providers will create two forms of cutouts: hacker teams to compromise their paying candidate’s adversaries and on-the-ground operatives to stage events, propel provocations, and instigate rallies creating a false, physical rendering of support for their candidate’s objectives. Trolling-as-a-service providers will create their own proprietary technology for social media reconnaissance and deployments, will work through third parties to garner massive amounts of user information, will provide their client’s plausible deniability of contracted influence efforts, and will advance trolling techniques designed to stay inside the terms of services (ToS) of social media companies.

But time and time again, the firms seem agonizingly slow to respond. No wonder some users are fed up. The companies have logically fought regulation, but unlike cybersecurity professionals who joined together in the face of relentless hacking waves, social media companies have hardly come together collectively to protect their industry against threats to customer trust. When combating the so-called Islamic State’s social media advances, tech companies created working groups but beyond the biggest platforms, they hardly had counterparts to interface with as extremists ran to smaller apps with more encryption. Social media’s giants missed Russia’s meddling before the U.S. election, and since this failure some have done better than others to spot the Internet Research Agency’s bad behavior. Thus far though, they’ve only shared small batches of data allowing for them to catch bad activity on their platforms. Data sharing, collaborative intelligence production and rapid response, along with self-regulation, would be logical ways to protect their industry and restore user confidence. If they don’t band together, social media giants will rot from the trolling cancer spreading across their systems. Social media, as an industry, should look to information security associations, particularly in the financial services sector, who routinely share malware signatures and threat techniques in cybersecurity despite competing as businesses. They’ve learned what the social media companies have not, loss of trust is a collective problem harming the entire industry, when one company fails, they all suffer.The larger puzzle piece remains the U.S. government response. The country’s leaders have been bizarrely slow to respond to Russian interference. And while social media companies have some explaining to do, so does Congress. In October 2017, the Honest Ads Act was put forth by Sens. Mark Warner and John McCain. Passage of the bill would require social media companies to attribute political and social advertising to the same degree as seen in print, radio, and television. Yet, six months later, this bill remains unpassed. In the absence of government movement, Facebook pre-emptively announced new procedures for ad verification ahead of its testimony next week.More damning from the Cambridge Analytica revelations is American political party acquisition of their services beyond President Trump. The most ironic of these customers has been Sen. Ted Cruz who not only received significant campaign support from Cambridge Analytica investor Robert Mercer and associated super PACs but also utilized Cambridge’s social media services. On Jan. 17, 2018, Sen. Cruz aggressively questioned Twitter during a Senate Commerce committee noting, “if you are a neutral public forum, that does not allow for political editorializing and censorship.” Sen. Cruz’s jabs at Twitter now strike an odd tone, and Facebook and Zuckerberg, when they go to testify, might turn the tables on the politicians that have used private American data from social media companies to target Americans. In their campaigning on social media, some congressmen have made it difficult for social media companies to be neutral public forums, as they exploited these platforms for personal political gain. Given that incentive, the question remains: Will Congress rise to stop the emergence of trolling-as-a-service, or will they instead accept the future, a dark world of predatory social media campaigning?Clint Watts is the author of Messing with the Enemy: Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, Russians and Fake News, available May 29, 2018."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) acknowledged this week that the 2018 midterm cycle could prove especially difficult for the Republican Party in the face of increased Democratic voter enthusiasm. In an interview with Kentucky Today, published Tuesday, McConnell admitted: “This is going to be a challenging election year."“We know the wind is going to be in our face,” he continued. “We don’t know whether it’s going to be a Category 3, 4 or 5.”McConnell said once again that the most important accomplishment, in his mind, of Donald Trump’s administration so far has been the number of conservative judicial appointments the president has gotten through. “I believe that’s the most important thing we’re doing,” the majority leader said. “You’ve heard me say before that I thought the decision I made not to fill the Supreme Court vacancy when Justice Scalia died was the most consequential decision I’ve made in my entire public career. The things that will last the longest time—those are my top priorities.”Given the legacy of that Trump-era accomplishment, McConnell is more hopeful of retaining the Senate than the House, acknowledging that more transient policy changes like the GOP’s tax reform can simply be scrapped “the next time the political winds shift.”“I’m hoping we can hold the Senate,” he said. “And the principle reason for that, even if we were to lose the House and be stymied legislatively, we could still approve appointments, which is a huge part of what we do.”While Democrats are, at this stage, likely favored to take a majority in the House of Representatives, the Senate is a different matter entirely. For Democrats to take the majority in that chamber, they would need to defend all their seats, many of which are in states President Trump won handily, and pick off two more seats that are in play.

  'body': 'A Democratic congressional candidate will pull her campaign ads from local Sinclair-owned television stations, in response to new controversy over the right-leaning media conglomerate’s practices. “Today, I have instructed my campaign team to cease and pull all campaign advertising on WDKY-TV (Channel 56), the Sinclair-owned television station in our congressional district, as soon as possible,” Amy McGrath, an ex-Marine running in Kentucky’s 6th congressional district, wrote in her statement.In an interview with The Daily Beast, McGrath said that they had heard from the network and the ads are coming down with a full refund on the way to the campaign. Sinclair came under fire this weekend after Deadspin created an eerie compilation video showing local anchors at Sinclair-owned networks reading from the same promo script decrying “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country.”The script was reportedly given to Sinclair’s nearly 200 television stations for required on-air reading.“Sinclair’s corporate-mandated ‘must-read’ right-wing script on its nearly 200 television stations about ‘fake news’ is itself an extreme danger to our Democracy and eerily mimics the propaganda efforts that authoritarian regimes often use to control the media in their own country,” Wright lamented in her statement.“The nearly 20,000 grassroots donors who have contributed to my campaign should have the expectation that their financial support will never be used to enrich these chilling right-wing efforts to stifle the critical role of local journalism to advance their narrow ideological and political agenda.”Asked whether she was concerned that taking down the ads could give her opponents more opportunity to air their own ads unchallenged, McGrath said she weighed that as part of a calculated decision.“I realize that I’m not going to reach certain people at certain times by doing this,” McGrath told The Daily Beast. “You’ve got to do the right thing and I think the right thing was to stand and say this is wrong.” She said the campaign has a new ad that will launch Tuesday on a different network. McGrath also called on her fellow Democratic candidates to follow suit. The Daily Beast has reached out to other congressional candidates to see if they plan to follow her.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had a message for her party’s midterm candidates who have campaigned on removing her from House leadership: “Just win, baby.”The top House Democrat on Tuesday brushed off concerns about several 2018 candidates telling constituents that they do not support her as leader, telling Politico Playbook: “I think if they have to do that to win the election, I’m all for winning.”She continued: “I think many of them are saying we need new leadership. I don’t take offense at that.”Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA), who won in a shocking upset earlier this year in a gerrymandered district President Trump won by almost 20 points, often said on the trail that he would be supportive of new Democratic leadership. Despite that, Republican outside groups still attempted to tie him to Pelosi, who they view as a drag on all Democratic candidates this cycle. Pelosi has recently said that she still plans to remain as the top Democrat, and is bullish on the odds the Democrats taking back a majority in the House, and thus reinstating her as Speaker of the House.During the Tuesday interview, Pelosi additionally cautioned against candidates touting on the campaign trail an impeachment of President Trump, despite it being an animating issue for some districts. “I’ve just said to folks, ‘I wish you wouldn’t.’ You can talk about it in your district. In my district, it’s a very popular issue but it’s not the path that we should go on,” she said. “I’m not walking away from impeachment for political reasons and I’m not walking toward it for political reasons. I just think it’s divisive and I think what we should do is always try to unify.”'},
 {'title': 'Top Trump Fundraiser Caught Working for Assad Ally',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Brian Ballard, viewed by some as the lobbyist closest to President Donald Trump, is working for an ally of Syria’s brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Ballard’s firm, Ballard Partners, disclosed on March 15 that it has taken on a Dubai-based trading company called ASM International General Trading LLC as a client. A Daily Beast analysis of open source materials—including website registration information, leaked offshore investment documents, and résumé sites—indicates that ASM International General Trading is affiliated with a member of Syria’s wealthy Foz family of international businessmen, which reportedly has close links to the Assad regime.Reached for comment, Ballard told The Daily Beast his firm will cut ties with the company if it has links to Assad. “We’re going to do more due diligence,” Ballard said. “We’re not the CIA, but if it were to turn out that there was any connection at all, we would withdraw from our representation of the Dubai trading company.” Ballard’s firm also represents an anti-Assad group, according to disclosure filings. “We also represent a group of Syrian-American doctors and others who want a Syria free of Assad, which we fully support,” Ballard added. “We’ve lobbied for that and we’ve never lobbied anything but that, and never been asked to, out of fairness to the trading company.”Representatives for the Foz family did not respond to requests for comment.“The Trump administration has been turning up the heat on the Assad regime. Meanwhile, one of Assad’s allies appears to be working with one of Trump’s.”The revelation comes as the Trump administration has been turning up the heat on the Assad regime. Ballard’s lobbying firm disclosed its work for ASM almost exactly one month before Trump ordered a second round of airstrikes on regime targets. That move came in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons to kill civilians in Douma, a rebel stronghold. For years, Syria has been racked by a bloody war that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The violence has turned Assad into an international pariah. Meanwhile, one of Assad’s allies appears to be working with one of Trump’s. The Foz family has long had business interests throughout the Middle East, including in Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. And the clan has drawn scrutiny for its relations with the Assad regime.A 2013 Reuters investigation found that one of the Foz family’s companies, the Aman Group, brokered grain deals with a regime company, Hoboob. The story pointed to the Foz family as “members of Assad’s inner circle,” poised to profit off the war’s food shortages. And the Financial Times reported on March 14 of this year that Foz “has direct ties to the [Assad] inner circle.” “Syrian opposition leaders say Mr. Foz has used Dubai as a business hub, allowing him to develop links with Iran, an ally of the Assad regime,” the FT reported. “But observers in Damascus say he is now moving closer to Moscow businessmen, as Russia steps up efforts to invest in Syria.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In a rare interview with Arabisk London magazine, Samer Foz said his company “will not hesitate to participate in the reconstruction” of Syria as the war winds down and that “we do not care to participate for profit, but to contribute to the reconstruction of Syria, which deserves many of its sons.” When asked about his political aspirations, Samer Foz told the magazine, “I am an economist and have no interest in entering the world of politics.”An article published Sept. 19, 2017, on the Syrian news site Albawaba highlights a business deal between Samer Foz and Assad’s government. According to the site, the government seized land in Damascus—“compensating owners very little”—to sell to private developers. Samer Foz’s Aman Group is putting up nearly $19 million for the project, according to the site. Discussing the same deal, Syria expert Joseph Daher noted that Samer Foz is “very close” to Assad’s regime. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that Saudi Arabia’s Prince Alwaleed bin-Talal sold his share of the Damascus Four Seasons to Samer Foz. Ballard’s lobbying disclosure forms link him indirectly to Samer Foz and directly to Samer Foz’s brother and business partner, Amer. Ballard lists as a client a company called ASM International General Trading LLC, a trading firm based in Dubai. Amer Foz is its general manager, according to several résumé sites as well as personal websites for Foz. The two brothers’ business interests—ASM International General Trading, and Samer Foz’s Aman Group—are closely intertwined. According to the Panama Papers—the cache of files stolen from the offshore Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca—Samer and Amer Foz are listed as shareholders of Alaman for Jets Limited, a private airline that plane spotters have documented at airports in Turkey, the U.K., and Italy. Photos of a plane registered to Alaman for Jets show the aircraft’s tail emblazoned with the name Foz.Registration information provided by the research company DomainTools also shows that websites for both Samer’s Aman Group company and Amer’s ASM International General Trading were at one time registered to the same Dubai-based person, Marah Nader Bitar, using the same Yahoo email address.The website Fozyatirim.com (“yatirim” is Turkish for investment) lists the same Dubai P.O. Box as the one Ballard listed for Amer Foz’s ASM International General Trading on its U.S. lobbying disclosure forms.Résumés for Amer Foz posted on professional websites—including one linked to by an apparent personal website for Foz—describe him as having “extensive experience as the deputy general manager of ِAman Group,” the company owned by Samer Foz.“Ballard’s firm already makes millions representing a host of foreign clients, including the governments of Turkey, Kosovo, Qatar, the Dominican Republic, and the Maldives.”Brian Ballard, who lobbies for the Foz-linked company, has rapidly ascended in Washington. A recent Politico profile dubbed him “The Most Powerful Lobbyist in Trump’s Washington” and reported that he is “closer to the president than perhaps any other lobbyist in town.” Ballard and managing partner Susie Wiles are both Trump campaign alums; he raised millions for Trump, while she helmed its successful Florida campaign. Ballard’s firm makes millions representing a host of foreign clients, including the governments of Turkey, Kosovo, Qatar, the Dominican Republic, and the Maldives. Ballard’s firm also represents an organization called Citizens for a Safe and Secure America. According to its lobbying disclosure, the organization is pushing for democratic elections in Syria and an end to the civil war. It also seeks “to encourage the return of Syrian refugees and displaced persons to their homes.” Rim Albezem, who works with the anti-Assad group, told The Daily Beast she’s been pleased with Ballard’s work. “If they have represented companies from Dubai, and they did that not knowing that they are affiliated with the Assad regime, and they confirm that those companies are affiliated with the Assad regime, I’m sure they will terminate their affiliation,” she said.Americans seeking to influence U.S. policy on behalf of foreign clients generally must register as foreign agents with the Justice Department, but the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) allows firms representing foreign companies to register under its less stringent rules. In this case, Ballard registered under the LDA rather than under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).Lydia Dennett, an investigator at the Project on Government Oversight who specializes in monitoring foreign lobbying, said she couldn’t say whether Ballard should have registered as a foreign agent for its work on behalf of ASM International General Trading but says in general the gray area between foreign companies and foreign governments is a problem for monitoring foreign influence efforts. “Unfortunately we’ve seen this exemption be exploited, particularly if the entity footing the bills is a foreign company but the entity benefiting is actually a foreign government (as was the case for Michael Flynn),” Dennett told The Daily Beast in an email. “Too often this misunderstood exemption, combined with the Department’s poor enforcement of FARA and reliance on voluntary compliance, allows those representing bad actors to slip through the cracks.”Former Rep. Robert Wexler, who served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and was active on Middle East issues, is one of the Ballard Partners lobbyists working for ASM. He traveled to Syria in 2004 to meet with President Assad after the Syrian government had denied previous visa requests—the result, he wrote in a 2009 memoir, of his criticism of an anti-Semitic speech delivered by Assad in 2001 and his sponsorship of sanctions against the Assad regime. The meeting was “fairly confrontational,” by his account. “I was vehemently opposed to the Assad regime, but I believed that part of my job included meeting with people I despised,” he wrote. UPDATE: After publication of this story, Ballard Partners announced it will no longer represent ASM International General Trading LLC, which The Daily Beast showed has links to Syria’s brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Sunday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, announced that the Treasury Department would be rolling out tough new sanctions against Russia on Monday as punishment for its continued support of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.But not 24 hours later, the White House threw Haley under the bus with a clear, contradictory message: Not so fast.“We are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.Sources familiar with the sanctions rollout process described a chaotic back-and-forth as lawmakers and staffers were struggling to figure out what Haley was exactly referring to. It was unlikely that Haley, who has been lauded by lawmakers from both parties for her tough anti-Kremlin positions, would have misspoken so egregiously if a sanctions regime was not already in the works. By Monday morning, the congressional committees that were responsible for drafting a sweeping sanctions bill last summer had not heard from the Treasury Department, indicating that Haley had apparently spoken too soon. But later Monday, The Washington Post reported that President Donald Trump personally intervened after Haley’s statement and halted the sanctions plan in its tracks, undercutting his U.N. ambassador in remarkable fashion.Capitol Hill sources directly involved in the rollout of congressional mandated sanctions indicated that they had not received a heads up from the administration about impending financial punishments against Russia beyond the coordinated airstrikes that the U.S., along with its French and British partners, conducted on Friday and Saturday. The absence of such a notification from the administration led Capitol Hill staffers to speculate that the White House was scrambling to clean up Haley’s statements.“The reversal is astounding,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a tweet. “Either Pres. Trump doesn’t think we need more action or they cant handle a simple rollout announcement. Mr. President, get your act together. What’s the strategy?”Haley, who has built up a reputation as a Russia hawk during her time as U.N. ambassador, said on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin “will be announcing those [sanctions] on Monday, if he hasn't already.” The Treasury Department did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment on the matter, but on Monday it became clear that Mnuchin had neither announced those actions nor were they even finalized.Haley said the imminent sanctions would target some Russian companies and entities that do business with the Assad regime, whom the U.S. and its allies have blamed for a chemical-weapons attack on innocent civilians in the war-torn country this month. The financial punishments would specifically target Russian companies whom the U.S. deems provided material support to the Assad regime’s alleged chemical weapons attack and previous assaults on innocents.But without Trump’s signoff, those measures remain on ice. The president has recently approved some of the tougher anti-Moscow policies of his presidency, including calling out Russian President Vladimir Putin more directly for the Kremlin’s support of Assad. But internal disagreements over how strongly to punish Moscow continue to feed criticisms of Trump and his administration over what critics contend is their deferential posture toward Russia and Putin.“This sends a message to governments around the world that they can support brutal, criminal behavior without serious consequences,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “President Trump is out of step with the American people, American values—and as this situation has made clear, his own Administration.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Is Thinking About Inviting Kanye to the White House for Dinner, Sources Say',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As the president promotes and excitedly tweets about a potential for peace between the two warring Koreas, he has displayed almost as much excitement over the recent overtures of one of America’s most acclaimed rappers.But it wasn’t just about Kanye this week.President Donald Trump and his allies once again plunged feet first into the pop-culture wars, riffing on Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain, YouTube celebs Diamond & Silk, and, of course, his bizarre bromance with Kanye West. It’s a sign that shows how vanishingly little has changed about Trump’s priorities and character ever since assuming the highest office in the land. As has been the case for decades now, there is barely anything that Donald J. Trump relishes more than basking in the praise of A-list—and sometimes decidedly D-list—celebrities.Over the past several days, West has been very publicly proclaiming (as the recording artist has done in the past) his intense, brotherly affection for President Trump. And the president—more starved now for A-list celebrity friends than he’s ever been in his public existence—almost immediately took notice. Beyond repeatedly communicating with West on Twitter this week, Trump has asked associates and aides if he should invite the rapper over to the White House for an Oval Office photo-op or for dinner, according to two sources close to the president. One of those sources noted they couldn’t tell if Trump was “kidding” or not, and also recalled that Trump reiterated how much he enjoys that West has “always said wonderful” things about Trump.That last point is, however, debatable. The award-winning rapper’s 2010 song “So Appalled” includes the line, “Donald Trump takin’ dollars from y’all.” The year prior, Trump had told TMZ that West’s behavior toward Taylor Swift was “disgusting,” and even advocated boycotting West “so this kind of thing doesn’t happen” again.But the bond between the two wealthy, egotistical icons appeared to strengthen during the presidential transition in late 2016, when West met with the then president-elect at Trump Tower in New York City. According to veterans of the campaign and transition, that meeting had caught many senior Trump staffers at the time completely off-guard—they learned the summit was occurring as they saw tweets get tweeted, or saw the livestream of West walking into Trump Tower with his entourage on cable news.“One morning, it was just suddenly, ‘Well, I guess Kanye is here to meet [President-elect] Trump today, what is going on, what is this,’” a senior Trump transition aide recalled to The Daily Beast. At the time, West had just told fans in San Jose, on the second leg of his Saint Pablo tour, that he would have voted for Trump in the 2016 election, had he actually cast a ballot. Shortly afterward, the rapper was hospitalized for what was reportedly a mental breakdown.Nowadays, it’s not just the president trying to capitalize on West’s MAGA affinities. Members of the Trump clan, including Donald Trump Jr. and White House senior staffer Ivanka Trump, enthusiastically boosted the rapper on social media this week, and the Trump re-election team started fundraising on Thursday off of West’s comments, and there is serious talk within the campaign of trying to involve West personally in the pro-Trump fight.In a very short span of time, the upper echelons of Trumpworld had aggressively and loudly embraced Kanye West. It was a perfect reflection of the man they all serve and work for—someone who, even as the most powerful person in the world, has yet to shed his decades-long obsession with celebrity, gossip, media, and name-dropping.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

We have tremendous fans. If I ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C., we’d have millions of people coming into Washington because they love what’s happening.”According to aides, Trump thought the interview went well and considered it a slam-dunk—even as many senior officials remained dismayed at the potential legal and political damage that the president can cause with these types of freewheeling, grievance-filled live interviews that often resemble private phone calls to friends and confidants. (For instance, on that same Thursday morning, Trump’s comments on Fox & Friends were immediately used against the president’s embattled personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen in court.)Two White House officials independently referred to the Fox & Friends appearance as “therapy” for the president—therapeutic sessions that, apparently, Trump intends to call in for many more times during his presidency.On Friday morning, Trump’s White House counselor Kellyanne Conway announced on Fox & Friends that the president says he is now considering calling into Fox at least once a month. Before becoming leader of the free world, Trump used to have a regular segment on the program, and this move would afford him more ample opportunity to discuss the news of the day and his other preferred popular-culture and culture-war fixations.One of those fixations is the Trump-boosting YouTube duo and Fox News guests Diamond & Silk.“We have people—Diamond & Silk are warriors, by the way, how about Diamond & Silk?” the president asked, rhetorically, during the Fox & Friends interview. “They’ve become amazing. You know, that started off like somebody was talking about them on the internet. They were these two women—these two beautiful, wonderful, women. And I said, well, let me check it out. It took me about two seconds to say stardom, it’s incredible. So, Diamond & Silk, these are all warriors.” (“Warrior” is one of President Trump’s favorite terms to use to denote top media surrogates and other people he regularly sees defending him on TV.)Shortly after Trump’s words of praise for them, Diamond & Silk—whose real names are Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson—appeared on Capitol Hill on Thursday to testify before the House Judiciary Committee regarding their (patently false) claims of being censored by Facebook for being too right-wing.It did not take long for the hearing to devolve into a surreal foodfight, that included potential instances of perjury. There were many moments during the hearing where there was barely a person in the room—including and sometimes especially Democratic and Republican lawmakers—who wasn’t actively trying to suppress laughter or glancing at each other trying to figure out what the hell was going on.The hearing was, in a way, a microcosm of the Trump era itself—loud, pugnacious, social-media-focused, and post-truth.“Facebook censored our free speech!” Diamond shouted at lawmakers, before alleging that President Trump is also a victim of alleged social-media censorship and possible “dictatorship.” (The pair gave no evidence for the assertion that @realDonaldTrump, of all accounts, has been in any way silenced.)For its part, the Trump campaign is, much like the president, getting in on the Diamond & Silk love, too.“I’m proud of the work that Diamond & Silk have been doing since the 2016 campaign,” Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser on the Trump re-election effort, told The Daily Beast. “I knew that when I posted their video and [Matt] Drudge catapulted the sisters into viral prominence that they would be famous and well deserved.”"},

  'body': "With the cancellation of ABC's Roseanne reboot, America has been engulfed once again in one of our periodic (and by periodic I mean “daily”) cultural-political bonfires. The temptation to engage with the last 48 hours of Trumpian excess, mad capering, and feces thrown from the gilded monkey cage of the West Wing is powerful, and the forces of the Distraction Economy tempt us into doing just that.We could discuss how Roseanne is infected with the same strain of dumb conspiracy disease that has eaten the brains of much of the GOP base like a memetic Creutzfeldt-Jacob prionic parasite. We could mock the social media meltdown over Kim Jong Don meeting with Kim Jong Kim in the Oval Office. We could hold up the ludicrous Trumpian defenses Roseanne’s tweets about Valerie Jarrett to ridicule. “But Bill Maher compares Trump to a baboon, so Roseanne is totally not racist comparing a black women to a monkey” is a bad look, people. I’m trying to help you here.Sure, we could worry about the desperate, fawning, oh-please-love-me need of today’s Republicans to have some celebrity, any celebrity, embrace Esoteric Trumpism. We could talk about how that led the Trump and the GOP into bed with a crank like Roseanne. We could ponder why King Stompy Foot of the Kingdom of Delicate Egos is ragetweeting apology demands to ABC. \xa0That would be fun, but it would be missing the big story. The big story is how the cancellation of Roseanne endangers a vital cultural window into red-state America and how the Liberal Snowflake Globalist Soros-Progressive Deep State Antifa Supersoldiers, Bilderbergers, Illuminati, and Lizard Alien Overlords who run ABC have insulted the Real America and the President of Real America.“Roseanne is worried that the Conner family is in too deep. Dan is spending too much time partying with Anthony Scaramucci.”What Americans don’t know is that the creative process for Season 2 of the new \xa0Roseanne show was already well under way. Sadly, they’ll never see the light of day. The episode summaries that were leaked to me today are a cultural treasure, a deep insight into Trumpmerica, and some Emmy-worthy television, believe me. Many people are saying it.Season 2 Episode 1 PIZZADan and Roseanne go deep undercover on a secret mission to stop Hillary Clinton's child cannibal sex slave ring hidden in an innocuous Washington pizzeria. After she and Dan are trapped by Hillary’s pantsuited minions, there’s a brief, decisive gun battle where John Podesta is killed by a random gunman who read about it on Infowars. The episode ends in a heartwarming group hug with the tens of thousands of child sex slaves held in the restaurant’s subterranean sex dungeon. Hillary escapes in her robot exoskeleton, setting up a story arc that leads us to the next episode.S2 E2 CITRONELLAOn the hunt for Hillary, Roseanne finds herself in Charlottesville, Virginia and learns a heartwarming lesson about the economic anxiety driving American youth. It seems that Obama’s Islamofascist multicultural police state forced -- forced -- these white-polo-and-khaki-clad young men to engage in torchlight parades, vehicular manslaughter and racial assault. It’s sad we’ll never see the hilarious scene where Dan thinks Richard Spencer is chanting, “Juice will not replace us.” Comedy gold! \xa0It’s a feel-good episode that really captures the way society marginalizes and victimizes white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, Pepe fanboys, pot-gutted, four-toothed Klansmen, and incel anime enthusiasts.S2 E3 FISH PEOPLEIn a delightful real-life crossover, Roseanne find herself guest-hosting an episode of InfoWars Action Alert QAnon News Hour. She knows only Alex Jones can help her get back on the trail of the real killers of Seth Rich. Roseanne has to move fast, and rely on her plucky, workin’ class wits when Alex Jones accidentally drinks fluoridated water, is caught under the path of a Deep State chemtrail, and mistakenly forgets to take his InfoWars MegaBlast TestestoSlam Super Vitamins.

In this episode, the Conners have new next door neighbors, a wacky same-sex couple. Dan may not be comfortable with it, but when Roseanne invites Steve and Stephen to dinner, the comedic sparks fly! Steve Bannon, the older man of the couple teaches Roseanne about Julius Evola, and Dan teaches Stephen Miller how to use a torque wrench. It’s a tragedy we'll never get to see the deadpan moment when Miller was going to break the Fourth Wall and say, “I’d rather learn how to use a surgical saw.”S2 E5 DOWN MEXICO WAYHot on Hillary Clinton’s trail again, Roseanne, her sister and daughter head south of the border. Roseanne explains to Jackie and Darleen that they’re going undercover to bust the links between Hillary Clinton and MS-13. The episode’s set-piece sight gag is Roseanne, her sister and daughter in sombreros, ponchos and fake Olde Timey Mexican Bandito moustaches. It’s a laugh riot! Trapped in Mexico after a fierce gun battle with Hillary, Bill, George Soros, and Zombie Saul Alinsky, the girls have a series of hilarious comedy hijinks as they try to cross the border. They’re stymied by Donald Trump’s Wall at every turn! S2 E6 Q-ANONRoseanne and Dan receive a summons from the mysterious QAnon. This episode really speaks to the forgotten working men and women of America, as Q helps Roseanne learn all about what’s really going on just below the surface! (And it’s spelled “J-E-W!”) Imagine the fun when the Conner clan eagerly bring their down-home working class values to 4chan, 8chan, Reddit, and Gab! Sadly, we’ll never see Roseanne patiently explaining to Dan how incel shitlords are the key to really making memes real and America great again.S2 E7 BLTRoseanne is worried that the Conner family is in too deep. Dan is spending too much time partying with Anthony Scaramucci. Their daughter is trying too hard to dress, look, and sound like Ivanka. In a moment filled with homespun pathos set in the Trump Hotel in Washington DC, Roseanne is sitting alone in the BLT Prime Restaurant. The script had a to-camera monologue that would have been great. It gets to the heart of what Trump Country cares about: how the tax bill’s carried-interest deduction and hedge-fund carve-outs really helped lower-income families, the threat of globalist Jew neocon warmongers, Trump’s awesome new trade war, the Deep State, MS-13, uppity NFL players who won’t kneel, the lying, liberal MSM and why she loves the taste of snowflake tears.

  'body': "Gloria Allred is off Summer Zervos’ defamation suit against President Trump, days after a victory for Allred and Zervos when a Manhattan judge denied Trump’s\xa0request to dismiss the case.The famed attorney withdrew from the case in a Thursday court filing, which lists Mariann Wang as Zervos’ lawyer in the matter. Wang’s firm had completed most of the legal work in the case, the Associated Press reported. On Friday, neither Allred nor Wang would comment on the departure, save for a statement provided to the press.“Our withdrawal has nothing to do with the merits of her case against President Trump,” Allred said. “We will have no comment regarding the reasons for our firm’s withdrawal. We continue to wish Summer the very best in her pursuit of justice.”Wang thanked Allred, an outspoken critic of Trump, and her firm “for all their work on this important case.”“My firm will continue to represent Ms. Zervos,” Wang said. “We look forward to proving her claim.”Meanwhile, Zervos has issued a statement of her own.“I decided to part ways with Gloria Allred purely for personal reasons, having nothing to do with her work as my attorney,” Zervos said. “I look forward to having my day in court with my current legal team.”She concluded with, “I will have no further comment on this matter.”During a hearing in December, Wang said the president “was not above the law.” She offered to depose Trump at Mar-a-Lago “in between rounds of golf.”One month later, Allred told The Daily Beast that Zervos’ defamation case against the commander-in-chief is “going to be a battle.”When asked about Trump’s First Amendment defense, Allred said “the reason we filed this lawsuit is because we believe the truth matters.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

She accused her former Apprentice boss of repeatedly kissing and groping her without her consent in 2007, and of pressing his genitals up against her. Hours after Zervos came forward, Trump told supporters at a North Carolina rally that the allegations are “100% false” and that “they are made up, they never happened.”He added, “It’s not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears for personal fame, who knows maybe for financial reasons, political purposes.”Zervos filed her defamation suit in January 2017. She says Trump’s statements—that she created a “phony” story for fame—caused her emotional and financial distress, and her restaurant to lose customers.The statements “have been deeply detrimental to Ms. Zervos’s reputation, honor and dignity,” the lawsuit states, adding that Zervos “seeks all available remedies to undo this harm, including a retraction and apology by Mr. Trump.”"},
 {'title': '‘Stormy Will Eat You Alive’: How a Porn Star is Making Trump World’s Lives Hell',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As the 2016 presidential campaign entered its homestretch, Donald Trump and his team were drowning in the fallout of the infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” tape and the torrent of sexual assault and harassment allegations that were subsequently made against the future president.“It was like walking through a minefield every day [in that last month],” a former Trump campaign adviser recalled to The Daily Beast.But in that final month on the trail, there was something else weighing on Trump’s mind, even more than the assault allegations. According to three top campaign officials, speaking to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, Trump began pressing senior staffers about the specific dates that the women were alleging that the assaults, affairs, or harassment took place.If the date fell within the time period of the early stage of his marriage to Melania Trump—and the birth of their son Barron—Trump would suddenly care more about the story and quiz campaign aides more closely about it. Officials concluded that Trump’s true concern was not so much being accused of sexual harassment as it was, in the words of one aide, about “pissing off Melania.” One of these accounts of a consensual relationship that drew Trump’s intensified interest was published at the website The Smoking Gun under the title, “Donald Trump And The Porn Superstar.” The piece reported on Trump’s alleged “sexual affair” with Stephanie Clifford, an adult-film actress known by her stage name, “Stormy Daniels.” Such an affair would have taken place not only while Donald and Melania Trump were newlyweds, but soon after Barron was born.A year into the Trump era, the story of Stormy has morphed from a late-campaign nuisance into large-scale presidential crisis.“The president may be able to fire Mr. [Robert] Mueller and others who may challenge him, but he cannot fire me, or my client. We will not be going away any time soon,” Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ attorney, told The Daily Beast. “If they [in Trumpworld] are upset about what has transpired over the last two weeks, they are really going to be upset when they see what is going to transpire over the next few months—because the last two weeks haven’t been a warm-up lap.”Inside the chronically chaos-driven Trump White House, Stormy Daniels is a high-profile hassle and headache that now must be managed on a daily basis. According to two sources familiar with the situation, the White House press operation has at least one person whose job it is to monitor the latest developments on the Daniels front. Senior Trump aides say they generally go out of their way not to talk to the president about the tsunami of press coverage. “Why would I talk?” one White House official asked, noting how “uncomfortable” an exercise it would be. “With everything else going on, why would I want to do that?”Publicly, the White House strategy of handling the “Stormy situation,” aides say, is simple: Stress that the White House has previously addressed the matter, they have nothing to add, and move on to the next question.The president’s outward-facing approach has been steadfast silence—a stark contrast to how aggressively he’s gone after women who’ve accused him of sexual misconduct. When the White House press corps yells questions at him about Stormy, he stays mum. His Twitter feed has yet to address the continuous coverage of the alleged affair on cable news.But even as the president has stayed publicly silent on the issue, he and his team have ramped up a legal effort to fight it.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Trump has hired Charles Harder, known for representing Hulk Hogan in the sex-tape lawsuit that decimated Gawker. (On March 16, Harder filed court papers announcing Trump would join Essential Consultants—the LLC his longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen created to pay Daniels—and request her lawsuit change venues from Los Angeles County to federal court, as well as enter private arbitration.)Brent Blakely, who represented Paris Hilton in a trademark lawsuit against Hallmark, was retained by both Essential Consultants and Trump. In a court filing, Blakely claimed one or both of them could seek $20 million in damages against Daniels, or $1 million per violation of her nondisclosure agreement. And Jill Martin, a Trump Organization attorney, has signed an arbitration document for Essential Consultants. News of her apparent involvement raised eyebrows, as it seemed to contradict Cohen’s claim that President Trump wasn’t a party to the “hush agreement” and $130,000 payout to Daniels. Martin told The Wall Street Journal she filed the paperwork “in her individual capacity” until a New York-based attorney was approved to practice in California. But it also suggested that Trumpland was taking the matter increasingly seriously, no longer content to try and brush it away. The legal escalation comes as Daniels has shown little sign of being intimidated into silence. She gave a brief, largely biographical, interview to The New York Times and is set to appear on 60 Minutes Sunday evening—an appearance Trumpworld was considering seeking an injunction to stop, according to one report. Daniels’ attorney also has suggested that more will come after the 60 Minutes episode airs. On Thursday, Avenatti posted a cryptic Twitter photo of a compact disc in a safe, apparently hinting that Daniels may have photographic or even video evidence of her relationship with Trump.As the Daniel’s saga has persisted in the news, pro-Trump allies outside the White House have responded with shrugs. Some even suggest that the charges maybe be part of a vast\xa0anti-Trump conspiracy.“When I first met Donald Trump in the 1980s, he was known as a playboy. His playboy nature is baked into his candidate model today,” Michael Caputo, a Republican operative and a veteran of Trump’s presidential run, told The Daily Beast. “The same people who attempted to find and fund women who would make allegations against [Trump] in 2016, I believe, are the same forces behind the not-so-coincidental lawsuits now, initiated by Stormy Daniels.”Caputo added that “in the end, after the entire 1990s debacle behind [Bill] Clinton and his paramours… he came out of the presidency wounded but vindicated… Donald Trump will be wounded but vindicated.”But if anyone can take down a president, Stormy Daniels is the one, friends and colleagues argue. “Stormy will eat you alive,” Michael Vegas, an adult performer who starred in Daniels’ “Unbridled,” told The Daily Beast. “She has a reputation in the business where people are afraid of her.” But not because of a mean streak, Vegas added. She simply knows what she wants and how to be direct. “She’s not a numskull,” the actor said. “I believe she has the gusto and bravado to actually pull this off.” When asked what he meant, Vegas replied: “Expose the president for what he’s been doing. Expose him for his hypocrisy.”Rachel Starr, another X-rated actress, called Daniels one of the most respected women in the porn industry but someone who’s notoriously private.“I think it’s safe to make the assumption that she knows something,” said Starr, who maintains her neutrality when it comes to politics and Daniels’ battle with Trump. “I would find it very hard to believe that she would bring something to the public eye, to this level, if there wasn’t any substance to what she is saying.”Even without Trump using his large bullhorn and social media presence to attack her, the pressure being placed on Daniels has been heavy. Alana Evans, who previously revealed that Trump chased Daniels around his hotel room in his tighty-whities, told The Daily Beast that she and Daniels are receiving threats from Trump supporters, angry at the soap opera engulfing the White House. “There’s a crazy who has been sending Stormy threatening emails,” said Evans, who says the same man tried to add her on Facebook. The alleged stalker told Daniels that “he’s going to kill her at her dance appearances,” and “have his army come for her” and at one particular strip performance, “he was going to shoot her,” Evans said. Evans, a fellow porn actress, said the industry is gloating over what Daniels has already done. And though Trump may be acting as if nothing is taking place at all, they are confident that he will, eventually, have to answer for his actions. “She is taking him on,” Evans added. “And it’s going to be her words, if anyone’s, that takes that man down.”"},
 {'title': 'Feds Are Treating Michael Cohen Like a Mob Lawyer, Trump Allies Say',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are treating Michael Cohen like he’s a lawyer for the mob. That’s how seasoned white collar defense attorneys describe the raid on Cohen’s office, home, and hotel room conducted on April 9. Cohen is President Donald Trump’s longtime personal attorney. The news that FBI agents raided his office appeared to leave the president shaken, and he told a pool spray of reporters a few hours after it broke that he was now considering firing special counsel Bob Mueller. The raid was handled by the Southern District of New York, not Mueller’s office. Lawyers told The Daily Beast that raiding lawyers’ offices isn’t unheard of—but is generally used for lawyers who work with alleged members of organized crime, or for lawyers who are involved themselves in elaborate criminal schemes. “It’s a tactic generally used against organized crime, against very serious, very serious criminals and lawyers who are operating outside of the protections of the law,” said Alan Dershowitz, a liberal attorney and frequent critic of Mueller’s tactics. Because of attorney-client privilege, communications between lawyers and their clients are almost always protected from investigators’ prying eyes. Almost. The exception is when investigators convince a federal judge they have probable cause that the lawyer is involved in a crime. When that happens and a search warrant is executed—as happened today—then a team of attorneys who aren’t working on the prosecution go through the communications first with an eye to protecting privileged communications that aren’t evidence of crime. “It’s a tactic generally used against organized crime, against very serious, very serious criminals and lawyers who are operating outside of the protections of the law.”— Alan Dershowitz“The only excuse for raiding a lawyer’s office is if the lawyer is potentially involved in crime—if there’s probable cause to believe that the attorney is either involved in crime or his services are being used for that,” said Sol Wisenberg, a white collar defense attorney at Nelson Mullins and former federal prosecutor.David Rivkin, formerly an official at the Justice Department during the Reagan administration, said this kind of raid means federal prosecutors must believe Cohen is “involved in some ongoing criminal offense.” “It is remarkably unusual,” he added. Unusual, but not completely unheard of: These kinds of raids happen when lawyers are suspected of involvement in organized, complex criminal schemes. In 2014, for instance, law enforcement officials raided a law firm in Florida whose attorneys allegedly preyed on homeowners by conning them into joining lawsuits against big banks, according to HuffPost. And in 2013, officials raided a law firm with strong union ties that faced accusations of harassing public officials, according to the Los Angeles Times. “This is precisely the sort of development a complex investigation can have,” said Josh Geltzer, formerly an attorney in the Justice Department’s National Security Division, “and it would deeply infringe on the integrity of law enforcement in this country if the president were to respond by firing DOJ leadership or the special counsel himself.”The raid tactic drew quick criticism from the president’s outside allies and defenders. “It always raises serious civil liberties questions when the FBI seizes confidential lawyer-client material,” said Dershowitz. “And they say there’s a firewall, but the firewall consists of FBI agents who sit and read the lawyer-client material. They may not turn it over to the prosecution, but they still are sitting and reading lawyer-client privileged material. And when I tell a client that whatever he tells me, I’ll go to the grave with it, I don’t expect an FBI agent to be reading it.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

They think they’re saving the world.”— Victoria ToensingOn Monday night, two White House officials told The Daily Beast that President Trump is personally and closely monitoring the situation regarding Cohen and the raid—even as his attention is supposed to be focused on the evening’s meeting with national security officials and military leaders on the Syria war.“So, I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys, a good man, and it’s a disgraceful situation,” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday night. “It’s a total witch hunt. I’ve been saying it for a long time. I’ve wanted to keep it down. We’ve given, I believe, over a million pages worth of documents to the special counsel.”President Trump, in the process of defending Cohen and railing against the “witch hunt,” continued to publicly dangle the prospect of sacking the special counsel—without committing to any action yet.“Why don’t I just fire Mueller?” Trump said, responding to reporters. “Well, I think it’s a disgrace, what’s going on. We’ll see what happens. But I think it’s really a sad situation when you look at what happened. And many people have said you should fire him. Again, they found nothing and in finding nothing, that’s a big statement.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump and White House Counsel Don McGahn Have Been ‘Barely on Speaking Terms’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The addition of longtime Washington, D.C., lawyer Emmet Flood to President Trump’s legal team on Wednesday marks a major win for another top legal adviser to the president who has, for months, been operating in the Trumpland version of Siberia.White House Counsel Don McGahn was chiefly responsible for orchestrating Flood’s hiring and was thrilled when it was formally completed, according to four sources inside and outside the West Wing. That’s in large part because Flood provides McGahn with two things he’s long coveted: an ally on the legal team handling the Russia probe and a potential successor for his own post, which Flood, as part of this arrangement, will be granted in due time.There is no set date for McGahn’s exit from the White House. But for months now, his position in the administration has been shaky as his relationship with Trump has deteriorated. Though McGahn is in the room for meetings involving high-profile legal matters (EPA Director Scott Pruitt’s ethics foibles, the Iran nuclear deal, and so on) the two hardly talk directly to each other anymore. One White House official conceded that they are “barely on speaking terms” unless they absolutely have to be.Part of tension is intrinsic. The president and McGahn have vastly different personalities and interests. A longtime GOP lawyer who once chaired the Federal Election Commission, McGahn has never sought to be, as one source close to him characterized, a “shoot-the-shit” kind of adviser the way so many other West Wing officials have become in order to stay in Trump’s good graces. Though he worked as the lawyer on Trump’s 2016 campaign, “he doesn’t speak ‘Trump,’” another outside adviser close to Trump and McGahn said. “Never has.”Another factor in the chasm between the two men has been special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. McGahn has bristled at the accommodating approach that Ty Cobb—the lawyer Flood is replacing—often championed. But McGahn also ruffled feathers with the president over his more combative posture. The relationship between the two plummeted shortly after The New York Times published a story in January on how the president backed off of demanding Mueller’s firing after McGahn threatened to resign over such a move. According to three administration officials, the president subsequently vented about the Times story to McGahn’s face in a tense Oval Office meeting that included White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. During the meeting, which was first reported by the Times, McGahn and Trump argued about whether the president had actually, technically ordered the sacking of Mueller. McGahn had already rebuffed Trump’s earlier attempt to get him to issue a public statement denying the veracity of the January article published by the Times. And during the meeting in the Oval Office, he reaffirmed that he would not issue a statement knocking down the story. McGahn “would not lie about it and put his name to it in public,” as one senior Trump aide put it.According to multiple sources familiar with this episode and the aftermath, what little was left of the personal relationship between Trump and McGahn cratered at that point. Incensed by the White House counsel’s decision, the president would later wonder aloud to close associates if McGahn himself had leaked the initial Times report and if McGahn could be trusted in general.Presidents have had difficult relationships with their White House counsels in the past. But rarely, if ever, have tensions arisen to the extent that the two parties are operating at a distance.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Deploying the silent treatment against your White House counsel, particularly when you’re dealing with a host of legal issues and tensions with the Justice Department, is not a well-thought-out strategy,” Ben LaBolt, a former Obama spokesman who dealt with judicial matters for his press team, told The Daily Beast. But the Trump administration is sui generis in its operational structure. While the Trump-McGahn relationship may be unconventional, it also is a reflection of the broader disorder that has marked much of the White House’s legal structure—a disorder that Flood now must try to get control over. It is a difficult task, one that has befuddled McGahn himself. But whereas others have left, the White House counsel has persisted in his post. He has done so partially because he is somewhat walled off from the Russia probe (being a witness to a potential act of obstruction) and partially because he has focused his efforts on other consequential matters. More than anyone else inside the administration, McGahn is chiefly responsible for the robust effort to stack the judiciary with young, conservative judges. “President Trump campaigned on the promise to appoint judges in the mold of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, and Don McGahn has been instrumental in carrying out that promise,” said Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network. “The fact that President Trump has appointed a record number of extraordinarily qualified judges so early in his presidency, on top of appointing Justice Gorsuch, is a testament to the work done day-in and day-out by Don McGahn and his team.”McGahn’s efforts to overhaul the courts have been so aggressive that, at times, it has rankled Republicans on the Hill who occasionally have been openly critical of the quality of nominees he has sent to the Senate. But he is largely considered a driving force behind the most consequential element of the Trump presidency—a fact that makes the discomforts with the president bearable. As Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, simply noted, “Don McGahn has been key.”—With additional reporting by Betsy Woodruff and Lachlan Markay"},

  'body': "Now that the West Virginia primary is over, we may not be hearing “Cocaine Mitch” thrown around on the campaign trail anymore. But a slew of rabid Republican Senate candidates across the nation are likely to continue to lambast Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not doing more to carry the conservative agenda in Washington.For conservatives who have their sights set on the long game, those criticisms fall flat. \xa0\xa0That’s because quietly and methodically, McConnell is giving the nation’s federal courts a facelift that’s making the next generation or two of federal judges look like the offspring of Antonin Scalia and Rush Limbaugh.This silent but incredibly consequential judicial overhaul may have helped McConnell and the GOP establishment inside Washington, including President Trump, avoid a major embarrassment on Tuesday, after they teamed up to derail the campaign of coal magnate and former convict Don Blankenship in West Virginia. And yet, another round of McConnell haters are about to get their day.In Virginia, county supervisor Corey Stewart has called on McConnell to resign for signing off on a bipartisan $1.3 trillion spending bill, and in Mississippi, state senator Chris McDaniel has accused McConnell of supporting Republicans who often vote like Democrats. GOP Senate candidates in Missouri and Wisconsin have also blasted McConnell, while in Arizona former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has said he won’t support McConnell for leader if he’s elected.Many far-right activists across the nation vilify McConnell for maintaining his old-school tendency to work across the aisle on must pass pieces of legislation (almost exclusive bills that fund the government), for failing to secure the votes to fully repeal and replace Obamacare and for maintaining the Senate’s legislative filibuster rules that are intended to protect minority rights. But inside the Beltway, McConnell is largely viewed as the kingmaker of the numerous judicial thrones that dot the national landscape. “I think the world of the leader,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) told The Daily Beast. “He’s tough. You don’t want some weenie in that job. He takes a lot of arrows for a lot of people – that’s the job of the majority leader.”As for his greatest accomplishment?“We wouldn’t have [Supreme Court Justice] Neil Gorsuch without Mitch McConnell,” Kennedy said.McConnell deftly slammed the door shut on Merrick Garland, Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, on the very Saturday night Scalia died. And when Democrats were prepared to filibuster Gorsuch last year McConnell twisted arms and convinced wary Republicans to nuke the Senate rules and lower the threshold for Supreme Court nominees to 50 votes. Gorsuch may be the most visible face of the surgery McConnell’s performing on the nation’s judiciary, but he’s not the only one. This week Senate Republicans started to rush through a slate of circuit court nominees and by the end of the week they gave Trump a breathtaking 35 federal judicial appointments. Senate Democrats say Trump is set to oversee the confirmation of 21 circuit court nominees in less than 16 months, while Obama had to wait 33 months before he got that many judges appointed to the same bench.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.And once more, McConnell has bent the norms of his chamber to do it: disregarding the long-standing, so-called “blue slip” practice of getting the sign off of a judicial nominee’s home-state Senator before giving him or her a vote. It’s a very big deal. “The sad reality is Sen. McConnell’s leadership is dismantling the Senate as an institution brick by brick,” Sen. Dick Durbin, the number two Senate Democrat, told The Daily Beast. “This is a major part of the foundation of the Senate – that senators have a voice in the selection of judges that affect their home states.”While the Supreme Court hears about 80 cases a year, the judges on the nation’s 12 federal circuit courts are given the final say on about 60,000 cases a year – ranging from environmental to social policy and everything in-between, which is why most Republicans in the Senate are smiling at McConnell’s deft leadership even as he’s being blasted by many conservatives out on the campaign trail.“Politics is a rough and tumble business,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who used that blue slip process to hold up Obama’s nominees before embracing its abandonment this year. “It’s easy to criticize anybody up here. It’s easy to criticize anything. I would just ask anybody that’s going to do a fair evaluation of any senator take a look at what they’ve actually accomplished, and with Sen. McConnell, take a look at what we’ve done on judges.”“I think judges are always a legacy – incredibly important, but it just doesn’t really move the needle from the standpoint of public opinion,” Johnson continued.Democrats are acutely aware of the successes that McConnell has had. And as they gear up for the midterms, they are trying to put what they see as a judicial crisis on voters’ minds. They say they’re seeing some progress.“The Republicans are remaking the federal bench in the image of the far-right, fringe Republican ideology,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told The Daily Beast. “It is a concerted and relentless effort done very strategically and purposefully.”Blumenthal, a former state attorney general who serves on the Judiciary Committee, said judges haven’t become as big of an issue back at home as, say, the GOP tax cuts or efforts to deregulate, but he said he is hearing more voters bring it up.“There is growing awareness about this issue, not at the county fairs and parades, but, among a certain kind of demographic and group, there’s a growing sense of alarm and a feeling that Democrats pay a lot less attention they should and certainly less than Republicans do,” Blumenthal said.The GOP is showing no signs of letting up on their push to reshape the judiciary. On Thursday Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, who also is sending out an ominous signal for Supreme Court justices to retire now so the GOP can confirm a replacement before the midterms, told a conservative radio host that he plans to double down on judicial nominees and have his committee review a whopping five district judges and one circuit judge every two weeks.While many corners of the fractured GOP are frustrated with McConnell – including pretty much the entire House Republican Conference and \xa0Trump who has repeatedly called for lowering the filibuster threshold in the Senate – the White House largely gives him a gold star.“I think that we’re very grateful for what McConnell is doing, particularly on judges,” Marc Short, the White House Director of Legislative Affairs, told The Daily Beast. “We’re excited by what he’s accomplished.”Democrats are still trying to figure out how to get their voters to care about more than just Supreme Court nominees, but the consensus in the party is that November’s midterms are pivotal so they can stop the GOP from stacking the courts even further.“They’re avoiding what the Senate does best, and that is to make sure that we get qualified people on our bench, that we don’t politicize the bench, that we don’t go to trying to do partisan, extreme appointments,” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) told The Daily Beast. “What they’re doing is really compromising the role of the United States Senate in making sure that we have an independent judiciary that reflects those values.”"},
 {'title': 'Joe Biden Could Beat Trump in a Fight—and an Election',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Joe Biden is as close as it gets to the real deal for Democrats. I thought of this when, in a speech at the University of Miami this week, Biden said of Donald Trump: \xa0“A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, \'I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it.’ They asked me if I’d like to debate this gentleman, and I said \'no.\' I said, \'If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\'" Biden is the only candidate I think has a chance of whupping Donald Trump in a fistfight. And while this is surely a retrograde way to evaluate someone’s political chances, this is the America we are currently living in. Liberals are generally criticizing Biden for this outburst of toxic masculinity—which helps explain why they lost to Donald Trump in the first place. It seems they have learned nothing. Why did Donald Trump mop the floor with nice, optimistic conservatives like Jeb Bush and John Kasich? Why does Mitt Romney look small compared to him? And why is Jeff Flake no match for the Donald? These men were more qualified, experienced, and virtuous than the porn-star loving casino magnate. What is more, unlike Trump, they were (wait for it) right about a lot of things! Consider, for example, Flake’s opposition to protective tariffs. Or Mitt Romney’s warning that Russia was our greatest geopolitical foe. He was right as rain. But the American public chose to ignore this Cassandra, only to embrace someone four years later who seems to have a man-crush on Vladimir Putin. There are a lot of reasons why Trump bested better men, but a now-famous Bill Clinton maxim helps explain it—and also helps provide a road map for stopping Trump in the future. "When people are insecure,” Bill Clinton has advised, “they\'d rather have somebody who is strong and wrong than someone who\'s weak and right.” “You can’t look weak temperamentally and get away with talking about things like compromise and civility. You’ve got to overcompensate for that kind of soft rhetoric with a tough exterior. That’s Joe Biden.”Well, Americans were insecure in 2016—especially those on the right who believed their country was going to hell in a handbasket. They weren’t worried about the niceties of free-trade policies or showing compassion toward immigrants. They wanted, as Clinton described, someone who was strong. And they got a strong man, indeed. Clinton understood this. He had brains and brawn. Physically imposing and a witness to what happened to “nice” liberals like Michael Dukakis, Clinton could oscillate between empathy and machismo. Only the best politicians (in recent times, only Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton) have this range. But others can aspire to that greatness. And it occurs to me that the key skill needed to match up against Trump is strength. And that is something that can’t be faked.Sure, you could take a few tae kwon do lessons and maybe defend yourself on the street. You could walk tall with your shoulders back and project an air of confidence. Doing all of these things might help you avoid looking like an easy mark—a victim. However, these measures would be meaningless when you’re fighting Mike Tyson. He would see through that charade in two seconds. Not only would it be ineffective—it would probably piss him off. This is what it’s like trying to con a bully like Donald Trump. You have to be the real deal. This wasn’t a very presidential thing for Uncle Joe to say. But it’s better to be strong and wrong. And Biden isn’t fronting. This is who he is. There’s a story about a young Joe Biden who was lifeguarding at a predominantly African-American swimming pool in Delaware that I think makes this point. The story culminates with Biden warning a local gang member named “Corn Pop” who was getting out of line: “You might cut me, Corn Pop,” Biden allegedly said, “but I’m going to wrap this chain around your head before you do.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.I don’t know if this story is true; I suspect it is embellished. But part of me thinks it’s at least partially true. And part of me thinks that it at least sounds real—which is more than you can say for most of the words that come out of Donald Trump’s mouth. (Remember the story about him being willing to run into a school barehanded and take on a shooter?) Part of being tough—in the Trumpian sense—is having the audacity to tell a story like that (whether it’s true or not) and never show the slightest hint of regret or embarrassment. Maybe it takes a bullshitter to beat a bullshitter?By the way, Donald Trump responded to Joe Biden’s comments with a tweet. In my mind, Joe got the better of this exchange, as long as he doesn’t back down. Before we go on, I guess I should reveal why I’m invested in this Biden idea, despite all of his flaws. From about 2010 to 2016, I devoted most of my energy to figuring out how Republicans could avoid this moment. I even wrote a book called Too Dumb to Fail, in which I warned Republicans about the anti-intellectual trend on the right and the coming populist/nationalist movement. They promptly ignored my advice. Since then, I have devoted much of my thinking to how we (all Americans) can overcome the polarization and anomie that led to Trump. To get a better understanding of our current situation, I have talked to people like Joe Trippi (the main strategist who helped Doug Jones beat Roy Moore in Alabama) and the authors of the new book Why Democracies Die. Now, it’s important to understand that these folks generally view Trump as a potentially serious and unique threat—not merely as a normal Republican to defeat. Regardless, a couple of themes have emerged. First, there is a sense that (1) the best way to stop Trump would be to form a coalition between “Never Trump” Republicans and Democrats; (2) a portion of the American public is hungry for civility and compromise, and they are exhausted by the current chaos; and (3) the incentive structure for winning a Democratic primary rewards anger and polarization, while punishing compromise and comity. Joe Biden might be the only man who could thread this needle. He is old school enough to appease at least some Republicans who couldn’t stomach Hillary Clinton—as well as some of the working-class white voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio who voted Trump. His experience as Barack Obama’s veep might give him just enough cover from the progressive left to survive a primary election.It’s always important to be tough, but that’s doubly true if you want to talk about things like civility and decency. You can’t look weak temperamentally and get away with talking about things like compromise and civility. You’ve got to overcompensate for that kind of soft rhetoric with a tough exterior. That’s Joe Biden. It won’t be easy. Biden isn’t the best progressive for this #MeToo era. He’s an old white man. He has run twice and lost twice. He’s gaffe prone and has said racially insensitive things. He didn’t support Anita Hill when she claimed sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas. He seems to be, shall we say, “handsy” with the ladies. If he’s going to slide to the center and woo working-class voters, he will surely run afoul of some liberal orthodoxy. But if the special elections (see Conor Lamb and Doug Jones) have taught us anything, it’s that a moderate Democrat can win in places where a Pelosi Democrat might fear to tread. What is more, we have seen what happens to people who allow Trump to define them (see “Pocahontas,” “Liddle Marco,” “Lyin’ Ted,” and “Low-energy Jeb”). One gets the sense that Biden will give as good as he gets. As Democratic voters size up the field of aspirants desperate to prove their progressive bona fides, they may want to ask themselves: “Can we win with weak and right?” And he fights!'},
 {'title': 'Attorney General Jeff Sessions Huddles With Secretive Conservative Group To Warn Against Open Door Asylum',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On a drizzly afternoon in the tony Tysons Corner Ritz-Carlton, embattled Attorney General Jeff Sessions found a welcoming audience: the members of the Council for National Policy, a secretive and powerful conservative group. In the speech, Sessions argued it needs to be harder for people to get asylum in the United States. He said the asylum process is riddled with “ridiculous loopholes” that let people who enter the country illegally avoid deportation by claiming they fear persecution in their countries of origin.“That is just not sound policy, no nation should do it in that fashion, we shouldn’t either,” he said, drawing a bit of applause.Sessions is one of several powerful administration and Congressional officials to make the thirty-minute trek outside DC to address this ascendant group of power brokers. The group, made up of activists and donors, has kept its meetings behind closed doors for decades—and Republican politicians have worked to stay in its good graces. One person familiar with the group said its members feel they have more power than ever thanks to the Trump administration. Sessions mostly boilerplate speech hit all the right conservative notes. \xa0He spoke broadly about the Justice Department’s efforts to combat violent crime and the opioid epidemic, and discussed its recent settlements with Tea Party groups who sued over alleged discrimination by the IRS under the Obama administration. And he reiterated his claim that a settlement the city of Chicago made with the ACLU—requiring officers to document their stops of Chicagoans—resulted in the city’s ballooning homicide rate. The study Sessions cited as evidence for this has drawn significant criticism. He found a warm reception, and the speech was frequently interrupted by applause. “Everybody knows him personally because he’s been a constant friend of the people in this group for so long,” said one source familiar with CNP. Reporters weren’t allowed in the main ballroom where Sessions addressed the group. Instead, they sat in a separate room on a different floor of the hotel to view a closed livestream. CNP has seen its cachet grow under the Trump administration. The group’s three yearly meetings are always off the record, providing a forum for the conservative movement’s most prominent leaders to speak to its most generous donors and powerful activists. Unlike the Club for Growth and the Koch Network, which also bring together politicians and donors at exclusive retreats, CNP is staunchly socially conservative. The group’s meetings emphasize the full spectrum of conservative issues—including small-government economics and traditional Republican foreign policy concerns—and prioritize socially conservative efforts on marriage, gender, and abortion. Vice President Mike Pence has spoken to the group many times over the course of his political career. The night before Sessions’ speech, the vice president hosted about a dozen CNP members for a small dinner at his residence, according to three sources familiar with the gathering. The vice president’s office declined to comment on the meeting. “He is of that group,” said one person close to CNP. “That is his comfort zone.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Mark Meadows were scheduled to speak after the attorney general. The group has also received funding from the Mercers, a powerful conservative donor family who gave generously to Trump’s presidential bid. Sessions’ appearance at the group’s meeting is more evidence of their growing clout with the Trump administration. "},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen May Learn the Hard Way That There’s No Such Thing As Consigliere-Client Privilege',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Before he became President Trump\'s self-styled consigliere, Michael Cohen made a fortune in the taxi business.So, he certainly had the means and the ability to have hopped a cab down to Manhattan federal court on Friday morning to answer a judge’s queries regarding what appeared to be Trumpian exaggerations.Instead, Cohen remained uptown, chatting with the president on the phone and lounging with friends in the springtime sun outside his luxury Manhattan hotel. He did this even though the prosecution had filed papers attesting that it had established probable cause to believe he had committed multiple federal crimes.The president’s lawyer left his own lawyer, Todd Harrison, to explain to a dubious Judge Kimba Wood how he figured that the FBI had seized “thousands, if not millions” of documents from “multiple clients” when it executed search warrants at Cohen’s home, office, hotel room and safety deposit box last Monday.Harrison made that claim while seeking a temporary restraining order to get prosecutors to hold off on examining the materials the FBI had seized. The suggestion was that the sheer volume of the material and the number of cases they involved placed attorney-client privilege in jeopardy.Unless, Cohen’s lawyers said, they had a hand in deciding which materials should be excluded.Sure.In their response papers, the prosecutors countered, “Cohen is not a criminal defense attorney… and is being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centers on his personal business dealings. Based on information gathered in the investigation to date… Cohen has exceedingly few clients and a low volume of potentially privileged communications." The prosecutors added, “Cohen has told at least one witness that he has only [one] client – President Trump.” And Cohen’s HUGE case with Trump may not fall under constitutional safeguards.“There is reason to doubt that even communications with his only publicly identified client regarding payments to Stephanie Clifford, who is also known as Stormy Daniels, would be protected by attorney-client privilege,” the prosecutors wrote.Trump himself had helped make that possible.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Among other things, President Trump has publicly denied knowing that Cohen paid Clifford, and suggested to reporters that they had to ‘ask Michael’ about the payment,” the court papers say.Cohen may well learn the hard way that there is no such thing as consigliere-client privilege.The prosecution\'s submission also called into question Cohen’s contention regarding the number of documents. The judge asked Cohen’s lawyer how he came by that estimate. Harrison had no immediately clear answer.“How do you know there are thousands if you can’t answer my question?” Wood inquired.“That is our best understanding,” Harrison said.Wood was not going to leave it there. The president to whom Cohen has sworn his undying loyalty may deal in unending lies and exaggeration, but Manhattan federal court remains a realm of truth. “How did you get that understanding?” Wood asked.“Discussion in the defense team” Harrison said.“Really,” Wood said. “Who in the defense team?”“Judge, I’m not prepared to get into discussion of the defense team,” Harrison said. “That’s an approximation. I don’t have the exact number for you. It might be less than a thousand. I don’t know for sure.”“What I need to know is whether you had a basis as an officer of the court to tell me there are ‘thousands and thousands of privileged documents,’” Wood said.As 3 p.m. approached, Wood called a recess, saying she wanted a list of Cohen’s clients when the hearing resumed at 4 pm.“I can’t do that by 4 o’clock,” Harrison said.“I believe you can, so I want you to try,” Wood replied.Harrison could have gotten on his cellphone to Cohen, who could have just cabbed it down to the courthouse and provided the judge with a list of his clients, along with a more authoritative estimate of the number of documents involved.But Cohen stayed uptown and was photographed sitting outside Loews Regency Hotel with some pals who were smoking cigars. He does not look exactly carefree in the picture, but he also does not look like a man who fully appreciates the import of a prosecution document that repeatedly indicates that he faces more than one kind of serious trouble.“The searches are the result of a months-long investigation into Cohen, and seek evidence of crimes, many of which have nothing to do with his work as an attorney, but rather relate to Cohen’s own business dealings,” the document says.Note the plural “crimes” and the word “many.” Back down at the courthouse, the hugeness of the case had become apparent in the trembling hands of the manifestly un-Trumplike attorney, Joanna Hendon, who had been retained to represent his interests at the hearing. She spoke to the court before the break of “the exceptional nature of my client.”“What’s at stake?” she asked. “The viability of this prosecution. It has to be done right. He is the president of the United States.”When the court reconvened at 4 pm. Harrison said he had been unable to assemble a full and reliable list of clients.“Do you have access to your client over the weekend?” Wood asked.Maybe Harrison was unaware that Cohen was at almost that very moment being photographed chilling in the sunshine uptown.“I believe I’ll have access to him over the weekend,” Harrison said.Wood said that she intended to make the client roster public. That may include fellow GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy, for whom Cohen allegedly arranged a $1.6 million payment for a former playmate who had become pregnant. Wood allowed that she would redact from the list those clients whose very names would make clear the nature of their case. Wood said she understood concerns regarding the privacy of the clients in question if indeed there were more than one. She did not add that she had once had her own personal life muddied and smeared by the New York Post. At the time, she had already become well known. President Clinton had moved to nominate her for attorney general only to reconsider after it turned out she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. The previous nominee, Zoe Baird, had been dropped for her own nanny trouble, the whole thing being called Nannygate even though such hires were not then illegal.Wood now sits on the bench as a decent person made better by adversity. She is a judge who is not judgmental, but judicious. She is also a believer in fact. “Your inability to answer these questions suggests that Mr. Cohen should be in court next time,” Wood said.So, on Monday afternoon, the self-styled consigliere will be in the courthouse from which any number of actual gangsters have been sent to prison.But hey, maybe along with calling Cohen on Friday to “check in,” Trump was giving his consigliere an unspoken message by pardoning Scooter Libby, the former consigliere to Dick Cheney turned convict for perjury. One thing Trump would not want would be for Cohen to become so much like a real modern Mafioso that he turns rat.'},
 {'title': 'Devin Nunes Is the Emblematic Republican Hack of the Trump Era',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The sickest thing about the Trump era isn’t Donald Trump himself, but the way the Republican Party has completely corrupted itself to be his servant. The media love to highlight Republican Never Trumpers, and there are many in the pundit class. But not in the politician class. Out of nearly 300 Republican legislators in Washington, exactly one has been courageous enough to call Trump the shyster he so obviously is: Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. But he’s wimping out by retiring. On the other side, the competition for Best Supporting Actor for the Man Who Lies Every Time He Speaks is intense. You’d have to rate Mike Pence high, but nobody cares what the vice president says or does—any VP, but especially this one. Paul Ryan is way up there, if only for that single sycophantic adjective “exquisite” (applied to Trump’s “leadership”) after they enacted the tax bill. \xa0But I think it’s clear that the Oscar goes to Devin Nunes, because his corruption has consequences. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has a serious job. It’s a panel that has existed for nearly half a century, and it came into being to safeguard the republic against abuses of power by intelligence agencies. If you’ve never heard of Otis Pike, the Democratic congressman from Long Island, go Google him. He was exactly what a legislator in a democracy was supposed to be. The founding mission of the House and Senate intel committees was to protect American citizens against abuses of power by intelligence agencies. That’s a noble goal; the kind of thing the government exists to do. Nunes has corrupted that mission completely. He’s changed it from “citizens” to “citizen,” because his intelligence committee is in the business of protecting one citizen: Trump. In January, he pushed out the release of a memo that was obviously designed to shield Trump and that totally broke committee tradition and protocol. Then last Friday, his committee released its final report on the collusion question, and guess what? It found no evidence of collusion, because it chose not to interview anybody who might have had evidence of collusion. \xa0On Sunday on Meet the Press, former FBI Director James Comey called the committee report on a “wreck.” “It wrecked the committee, and it damaged relationships with the [U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court], the intelligence communities,” he said. Other former intelligence officials, like John McLaughlin on MSNBC Sunday afternoon, agreed that Nunes has politicized the committee in ways he’d never seen in 40 years. \xa0Back in January, McLaughlin, who once ran the CIA, tweeted: “FISA warrants typically are big thick documents, 50-60 pages. If the Nunes memo about one is just 4 pages, you can bet it’s a carefully picked bowl of cherries. Made all the more dishonest by holding back the minority rebuttal memo. A real debate needs both. Someone fears that.” I think we know who that someone is. The same someone Nunes is out to protect. I can’t say exactly what’s motivating the guy. But here’s a little hint. He represents a district in California’s Central Valley that abuts Fresno. The Cook Political Report rates it R+8, which means it’s a pretty Republican district, but not an overwhelmingly safe one. He has a serious Democratic opponent this year, a former prosecutor named Andrew Janz, who has raised $1.4 million in the last year. \xa0But Nunes has raised more—a lot more: around $2.5 million. How’d he do it? Here’s how the Washington Examiner put it this month: “Rep. Devin Nunes, a once-obscure Republican congressman from California’s rural Central Valley, saw his fundraising spike during the first quarter of the year as his steady antagonism of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation turned him into a national folk hero on the right.” So there it is. It would be one thing if Nunes chaired the transportation committee. In that case, having sold his soul to Donald Trump wouldn’t really matter. But now, the oversight of the nation’s intelligence agencies is governed by the committee chairman’s ability to raise gobs of right-wing money from people who are out to protect Trump. And that’s why the Oscar goes to Nunes. If there’s one chairmanship in the House of Representatives that’s supposed to be in theory somewhat apolitical, it’s the intel committee. It’s officially called the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and that word “select” means that the leaders of both parties individually choose the members. In theory, they’re supposed to pick people who have demonstrated in their House career that they’re not totally political animals. \xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

But just as Nunes was “selected,” he can also be unselected any time the speaker wants. Paul Ryan could fire him today. As Mieke Eoyang wrote in Politico recently, Ryan, who is retiring and thus “free” to act with something resembling integrity in his final days, should fire Nunes immediately. She lays out the whole bizarre history of Nunes’ capitulation to Trump, which started during the transition and got really weird when Trump accused Barack Obama of wiretapping him. Ryan won’t do that, of course. He’s too much of a coward to do anything that would unsettle Trump, as he’s proven time and time again. That job will be up to the voters of California’s 22nd Congressional District. Larry Sabato just downgraded the district from “safe” Republican to “likely” Republican.One of the signal glories of the Democrats taking back the House would be seeing Adam Schiff take over the chairmanship of the intel committee, bumping Nunes down to the powerless minority. But it would be even sweeter if Central Valley voters returned him to private life. He’s probably already earned a nice future on Fox News, but at least he couldn’t do any actual harm there. "},
 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Spent $105,000 on First-Class Flights',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Environmental Protection Agency administration Scott Pruitt spent about $105,000 on first class airfare since assuming the post, records obtained by The Daily Beast show. The details of Pruitt’s travel are spelled out in documents sent to congressional investigators on Tuesday as part of the House Oversight Committee’s probe into the use of taxpayer resources for official government travel.Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the committee, requested the records in February, indicating that they might show illicit government expenditures on lavish air travel.“Clearly, federal regulations prohibit a blanket waiver to fly first class except to accommodate disabilities or special needs,” Gowdy wrote in a letter to Pruitt at the time. “Instead, a waiver is required for each flight in order to fly first of business class when traveling on official government business.”I'm a letter to Gowdy, EPA said that Pruitt’s first class travel was approved “on an individualized basis,” and was necessary due to security concerns. His security detail, the letter said, “identified specific, ongoing threats associated with the administration administrator's air travel and, therefore, shifted his class based on security protocols that require him to be near the front of the plane.”EPA’s production of the travel records came two weeks after the deadline that Gowdy imposed last month. EPA and committee spokespeople told The Daily Beast last week that they were working to resolve the request despite the blown deadline.The White House has requested similar records from the EPA, two West Wing sources told The Daily Beast. The agency has yet to satisfy that request, though Tuesday’s document production to the Oversight Committee could make it moot.Pruitt has faced scrutiny over his penchant for first class air travel along with his large security detail. He insisted in a February interview with CBS News that flying coach presented security risks, but nevertheless said he would do so going forward due to cost concerns.In addition to his commercial travel, Pruitt had, by September 2017, spent about $58,000 on charter and military flights, according to records provided to congressional overseers. Pruitt’s staff attributed the most expensive of those flights to the administrator’s time constraints in getting to official events.Pruitt's air travel habits are part of a larger criticism of other EPA expenses under his watch, including the $43,000 spent for a secure, soundproof phone booth in the agency’s headquarters and accompanying renovations. The Government Accountability Office announced a probe into those expenses last month.Pruitt has also spent thousands of dollars on anti-surveillance sweeps of his office.

 {'title': 'Gina Haspel Said Only One Detainee’s Torture Was Taped. She’s Wrong.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It seemed like a small misstatement, the sort anyone makes from time to time, but it might augur much for Gina Haspel’s relationship with the truth as Donald Trump’s potential next CIA director. All the available evidence, to include declassified CIA documents, indicates that two detainees had their torture at the hands of the CIA recorded on 92 agency videotapes in 2002 at a black site Haspel eventually ran. The vast majority of the tapes showed Abu Zubaydah’s torture. A few showed the torture of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, whose waterboarding and other torture occurred under Haspel’s command as chief of base at the Thailand secret prison she ran between October and December 2002.Three years later, Haspel, aiding her boss Jose Rodriguez, drafted a cable instructing subordinates to destroy the tapes, despite resistance elsewhere within CIA leadership and George W. Bush’s administration. But Haspel, during her confirmation hearing last week, revised that history. She said only a single detainee’s torture was videotaped, when in fact there were two detainees treated in such a fashion. Though at least one senator has asked Haspel to correct the record, she hasn’t yet done so. The CIA subsequently implied that Haspel may be right, despite years of public evidence, including its own documents, to the contrary. It started during an exchange with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who spearheaded the Senate intelligence committee’s landmark investigation of the CIA torture program. Feinstein herself initially misstated a basic fact about the tapes, saying incorrectly that 92 detainees were shown tortured on the tapes, rather than 92 tapes existed showing the torture of two detainees.Haspel corrected Feinstein—but in the process revised the historical record substantially. “The tapes were recordings of only one detainee,” Haspel said. “Haspel’s revision of what the tapes contain suggested a historical erasure of a torture session she herself is implicated in overseeing.”An internal document about the torture tapes, declassified by the CIA at the ACLU’s behest, says otherwise. The document is undated, but describes an “inventory of all videotapes and other related materials” from the Thailand black site conducted on Dec. 3, 2002. Those materials were “created” at the site “during the interrogations of al Qaeda detainees Zayn al-’Abideen Muhammad [abu Zubaydah] ... and ‘Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.” The heavily redacted document provides blacked-out index descriptions for each of the 92 videotapes. Some declassified text refers to “Abu Z.,” “AZ” and “Detainee #1” next to some of the first 90 tapes. Descriptions of the final two tapes, numbers 91 and 92, contain a listed reference to a “Detainee #2.” There were only two detainees at the Thailand black site in 2002: Abu Zubaydah and Nashiri. Haspel’s revision of what the tapes contain suggested a historical erasure of a torture session she herself is implicated in overseeing. “From all accounts, Gina Haspel was a very strong proponent of the evidence destruction, but this discrepancy illustrates that there are still major gaps in the public’s knowledge of her role,” said Hina Shamsi, a senior ACLU attorney who has also cited substantial secondary-source descriptions of Nashiri’s videotaped interrogations. “And one of those major gaps relates to tapes of the torture of Mr. al-Nashiri, which she oversaw.”In addition to the document, CIA officials involved in the tapes-destruction episode have separately written about the videos displaying two detainees. Rodriguez, the former Counterterrorism Center (CTC) and National Clandestine Service chief, is perhaps the CIA’s premier defender of torture. He was Haspel’s boss when she began her work at CTC in 2001, when he was its chief operating officer, and then took her for his chief of staff at the clandestine service in 2004, where the two of them advocated to destroy the tapes.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Rodriguez writes in his 2012 memoir, Hard Measures, that by October 2002, the black site had already made “more than 90” videotapes—so many that CIA headquarters instructed recording each day’s recording over the previous day’s. “By this time, a second high-value al Qaeda detainee, al-Nashiri, had joined AZ at the black site,” Rodriguez continued, “and his interrogation was also videotaped.” (It’s worth noting that Rodriguez’s timeline is a little off. Nashiri didn’t arrive at the Thailand black site until Nov. 15, 2002.)The top lawyer at the CIA for much of the torture program, John Rizzo, who had reservations about destroying the tapes, also wrote that the CIA taped two detainees. Unlike every other source, however, Rizzo claims there were 96 tapes, not 92. “Ninety-six of the videotapes were recordings of the Zubaydah sessions. (There were also recordings of the interrogation of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a key perpetrator of the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. He was captured in October 2002 and taped only briefly before the CTC halted all videotaping.),” Rizzo wrote in his 2014 memoir, Company Man. Neither Rodriguez nor Rizzo responded to messages inquiring if they stood by their accounts of the CIA videotaping two detainees now that Haspel has said otherwise. Rizzo has previously abandoned his claim that Haspel had “previously run the interrogation program” after The Daily Beast reported on it—a story for which Rizzo provided a quote standing by a claim damaging to Haspel’s chances of confirmation. (Both Rizzo and Rodriguez’s book cleared the CIA’s Publication Review Board, which scrubs ex-employees’ books or articles for classified information, with their references to Nashiri’s videotaped interrogation intact.)\tIn fact, Haspel’s insistence that only one detainee was videotaped came after an exchange with Feinstein over Rizzo’s claim, and she took a subliminal shot at The Daily Beast over it. When Feinstein brought up Rizzo’s description of her role in torture, Haspel referenced a Washington Post story by Erik Wemple that mentioned the Rizzo book and The Daily Beast’s reporting on it. “Mr. Rizzo—and actually I read about it in The Washington Post last night. Erik Wemple, I believe, wrote a story talking about the failure of certain organizations to correct their facts, and that was one of them,” Haspel said. Wemple himself replied that Haspel had misrepresented his story in the course of implying that The Daily Beast was the one misrepresenting the factual record. “The Erik Wemple blog post cited by Haspel wasn’t focused on reportorial ‘failure,’ given the informational constraints at hand,” he wrote.“Asked twice if Haspel is saying she was right and these CIA documents incorrectly state that the agency videotaped the two detainees’ torture, a CIA spokesperson said he currently has nothing to add.”As it happens, Haspel has told the Senate that she would correct public misstatements. Responding to a question for the record from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Haspel wrote on May 5 that “if I were aware that I or another CIA officer had said something that I learned was factually inaccurate, I would attempt to correct the public record to the extent possible consistent with my legal duty to protect classified information and intelligence sources and methods.” Asked if Haspel would correct her misstatement, the CIA suggested she never made one. “Of course she’ll correct the record if necessary,” said spokesman Ryan Trapani, who went on to “flag” a section of a 2004 inspector general’s report that, in an unredacted section followed by a redacted one, referred only to Abu Zubaydah’s videotaped interrogation. Asked twice for clarification on whether Haspel is affirmatively saying she was right and these documents incorrectly state that the CIA videotaped the two detainees’ torture, Trapani said he currently has nothing to add.Feinstein, The Daily Beast has learned, has asked Haspel to clarify for the record whether the CIA videotaped the interrogations of one or two detainees. The Senate intelligence committee on which she serves is expected to receive Haspel’s additional answers this week, though it is unclear if those answers will come before her scheduled Wednesday vote in the committee. Her highly controversial nomination is gaining in strength, having secured the support of Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Susan Collins of Maine. Haspel’s misstatement also stands in contrast to her supporters’ portrayal of her as a bastion of truth who will stand as a bulwark against a president interested less in what is true and more in what is useful. “I have great confidence that Gina Haspel has the requisite background and the professional credentials to be able to speak truth to power, irrespective of the policy druthers of the person in the Oval Office,” Barack Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, told The Washington Post. That “truth to power” line appears to be something of a talking point for Haspel’s boosters. Another Obama CIA director, Leon Panetta, gave it to USA Today. The chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Republican Richard Burr, said at the hearing Haspel has “the courage to speak the truth to power”—something Haspel herself said was “one of CIA’s most important missions.”At her hearing, Haspel obscured all discussion of her own role in torture, and said the president who handpicked her to serve as CIA director, one who earned Brennan’s ire by comparing intelligence officials to Nazis, has shown the CIA “enormous respect.”UPDATE, 2:45 p.m., May 15: In her final round of written responses to senators’ questions before her confirmation vote in the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday, Haspel has conceded that there was a second detainee whose torture was depicted on the videotapes. But her answer stopped short of admitting that she was wrong to say there was only one detainee taped.“My understanding, which is consistent with the record (available to the Committee in a classified forum), is that there were 92 videotapes, two of which were labeled “Detainee #2,” Haspel said in response to a question from Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM).“The OGC [Office of General Counsel] attorney who reviewed those tapes in 2002 found that “there are no viewable videotapes of the interrogation of the second detainee. Therefore, when the tapes were destroyed in 2005, there was only one detainee depicted.”Feinstein’s colloquy with Haspel about the tapes last week meandered substantially, but at no time was Haspel asked how many detainees were depicted on the tapes as of 2005."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Pro-Trump vloggers Diamond & Silk found themselves the center of two high-profile congressional hearings this week as lawmakers obsessed over claims the duo were “censored” by Facebook.At least five members of Congress asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg about the claim that the YouTube duo were told by his company that their content was deemed “unsafe for the community.” The lawmakers, all Republicans, held up the claim as evidence of Facebook’s liberal political bias.In response, Zuckerberg stressed that the matter amounted to an internal mishap. “Our team made an enforcement error and we have already gotten in touch with [Diamond & Silk] to reverse it,” he told the panels. And in a statement to The Washington Post on Tuesday, the company confirmed: “We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform. We have provided them with more information about our policies and the tools that are applicable to their Page and look forward to the opportunity to speak with them.”On Wednesday, however, the flamboyant pair—Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson—claimed to the right-wing website The Daily Caller that, despite Facebook’s statements, no one from the social-networking site had ever reached out to them. Later that night, the duo appeared on the Fox News primetime show, The Ingraham Angle, and repeated the claim. “No one has been in communication with Diamond & Silk,” said Diamond & Silk. Internal Facebook communications prove otherwise.Conservative pundit Erick Erickson on Thursday published several emails from Facebook officials confirming the company reached out to Diamond & Silk as early as Monday.The Daily Beast can confirm the veracity of those emails.In one contrite email to the duo, Facebook policy manager Neil Potts wrote: “First off, we want to apologize for having mishandled communications with you over the last six months. I can only imagine how frustrating this process has been for you.”Potts made clear that any hiccups the duo might’ve experienced with their page was simply the result of complicated policy changes—not political bias.Those changes, Potts wrote, stemmed back to September 2017 when Facebook instituted new policies for how official pages can monetize their content. “We did not properly communicate these policies to you. As a result, you could not have known that the video content on your Page was not in line with our eligibility standards and did not qualify for monetization features,” he added. “We are eliminating the restrictions associated with your Page so that you can apply to monetize content.”Potts offered his team as a “resource” to assist Diamond & Silk with any further “content-related issues.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Regards, Neil.”The Daily Beast additionally confirmed with Facebook, as Erickson first reported, that the company made two attempts to reach Diamond & Silk by phone on Tuesday—the day before they went on TV claiming no one ever reached out.Facebook also directly responded to the duo on Twitter early Thursday morning, telling them, “A member of our team emailed you Monday and we commented on your Facebook post yesterday. We’d love the chance to speak with you about this issue and answer any questions you may have.”Diamond & Silk did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},
 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Is Destroying Earth Day',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "This year’s Earth Day is, frankly, not a very special one, because it’s both a comparatively inauspicious anniversary (who celebrates the 48th?!) and because we in the United States happen right now to be saddled with the most aggressively anti-Earth administration of the last 60 years.But don’t those two factors, especially the second one, provide all the more reason to contemplate this occasion, in their way? Most people don’t think much about it these days, but Earth Day was not just some crazy idea a bunch of meddling liberals cooked up to interfere with everyone else’s freedom to throw Whopper wrappers wherever they pleased. Earth Day was revolutionary. It changed human consciousness. Of how many things can that be said?The first one happened, as you hopefully deduced two paragraphs above, in 1970. At the time, of course, we’d had the civil rights revolution, the awakening of the feminist revolution, even the very earliest stirrings of the gay rights revolution. But there was as yet nothing called the environmental movement. There were, to be sure, smaller discrete movements or events or attempts to elevate people’s awareness. There was Rachel Carson and Silent Spring, her 1962 book about the dangers of DDT and other pesticides that became a surprise best-seller. There was First Lady Ladybird Johnson’s campaign against highway billboards. If you don’t think that was pollution, Google Image “highway billboards before Ladybird Johnson” to get a little taste. There was a Wilderness Act passed in 1964, which Ladybird also played a key role in pushing through Congress.But they were balkanized. “What Earth Day did,” says Denis Hayes, who was the national coordinator of the first Earth Day celebration, “was that it took all these strands and wove them together into the fabric of what came to be called the modern environmental movement.”The man who brought them all together was another remarkable figure who is little remembered today: Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. Nelson was part of that generation of men who’d lived through Depression and world war and saw public service as a duty to do something other than transfer wealth to the already rich. He was a dedicated consumer rights advocate, civil libertarian, and conservationist. As Wisconsin governor in the 1950s, he created a Department of Resource Development to oversee conservation and a Youth Conservation Corps to provide what were not yet known as green jobs for a thousand young people.In 1969, he got an idea for a day of thousands of demonstrations across the country to raise environmental awareness. Hayes, then a Harvard student, got wind of this and showed up at Nelson’s Washington office one day asking to be named Harvard campus coordinator of Earth Day. Nelson made him Boston coordinator. Four days later, Nelson’s office called him back and asked him to be the national coordinator. “Certainly the most rapid career advancement of my life,” Hayes deadpanned.Whatever he did, he did it well, because the next April 22 brought marches and speeches and demonstration on thousands of campuses and in hundreds of cities and towns across the country. And, as we hope we’re seeing with the Women’s March of our time, the event was just the beginning.I was nine when Earth Day happened. The change in the culture was immediate. There being no Fox News around then to inform its half of America that it was all a socialist plot, Americans developed instant environmental awareness. Littering became an act of opprobrium. The 1971 “Crying Indian” ad, probably the most famous PSA ad in the nation’s history, stamped itself on the national brain. At school, we were assigned to make posters associated with Earth Day, with certificates going to the winners, and your picture in the paper, even.And, of course, the movement achieved vast legislative accomplishments. Hayes emailed me a list of bills that passed within five years of that first Earth Day, and it’s astonishing:• \xa0In 1970, Richard Nixon established the EPA with an executive order*, and then Congress passed the: • \xa0Clean Air Act \xa0(1970)Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

I suppose in some parts of the country children are still taught to venerate Earth Day (although in my native West Virginia, the way things have been going, they’re probably about to create a Coal Day and award certificates to the kids who draw the best pictures of smokestacks). But as we know, we’re racing backwards fast, under the “leadership” of a head of the EPA who sees his mission as leaving as many citizens as possible exposed to environmental degradation while at the same time picking their pockets in ways that are breathtaking even by Trumpian standards. Just Google “EPA environmental regulations” and you’ll quickly see all the damage Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt are trying to do.Hayes tries to stay optimistic through it all. The pendulum swings, he reminds me. Yes, it does. And if the Democrats regain Congress in 2018 and the White House in 2020, they can swing it back in the other direction fast, on matters like the Paris climate accords and CAFE standards and a whole lot more. And that same 2020 that will bring us the next presidential election will also give us the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. “It will be a meme, a rallying cry, a hashtag, and an ongoing project that has real traction,” Hayes says. “It will emphasize climate change and will catapult it to a new prominence.” And let us hope that after the pendulum has swung back and then some, the man who organized the first Earth Day will be leading a celebration of something truly consequential by the time of the 60th."},

  'body': 'A third Republican member of Congress has now called for the resignation of embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) on Thursday joined fellow Republican Reps. Carlos Curbelo (FL) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL) in calling upon Pruitt to exit the EPA over multiple ethics scandals.“Congresswoman Stefanik believes it’s in the best interest of the EPA for Mr. Pruitt to resign,” a spokesperson for the New York congresswoman told The Daily Beast. “She will continue to be a strong advocate in Congress for environmental issues that affect our district, which is the proud home of the Adirondacks.”Stefanik initially made the remarks at a town hall meeting in South Glens Falls.On Tuesday, as the controversy ballooned around Pruitt’s stay at a Washington D.C. townhouse and its links to a prominent energy lobbyist who previously funded some of his political campaigns, two Florida Republicans also said he should quit immediately. “Major policy differences aside, @EPAScottPruitt’s corruption scandals are an embarrassment to the Administration, and his conduct is grossly disrespectful to American taxpayers,” Curbelo, who is running for re-election in an extremely competitive South Florida district, tweeted. “It’s time for him to resign or for @POTUS to dismiss him.”Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring after this session, told CNN afterwards that she concurred.“I agree with my colleague, Carlos, that the EPA administrator should resign,” Ros-Lehtinen said. “When scandals and distractions overtake a public servant’s ability to function effectively, another person should fill that role.”'},
 {'title': 'The GOP’s Latest Big Proposal Is a Gun Pointed at the Head of Our Economy',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'When they return from recess, Congressional Republicans will reportedly vote on a balanced-budget amendment (BBA) to the Constitution—a law requiring that annual spending not exceed annual tax revenue. A BBA requires two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate, not to mention ratification by three-fourths of the states, so it’s highly unlikely to be legislated. But even though it is unlikely to pass, it represents a huge and present threat to those of us who recognize the need for an amply funded government. Here’s why.\xa0Republican fiscal strategy has three goals: 1) cut taxes, especially for their wealthy donor base; 2) keep up the charade that they’re fiscally responsible; and above all, 3) significantly cut the social insurance programs that comprise the lion’s share of the government’s mandatory spending: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and SNAP (food stamps). They’ve achieved goal No. 1, though they’re predictably talking about going back to that well. Doing so raises the stakes for goal No. 2, which is where the BBA comes in. As for No. 3, both actions—tax cuts and the pursuit of the BBA—are key parts of attaining that goal, as I’ll explain. But first, let us count the ways in which the BBA is a terrible idea. One of the most important attributes of federal fiscal policy, especially in periods of economic weakness, is the ability for the federal government to spend more than it takes in. Consider the way unemployment insurance or nutritional support ramps up when the economy ramps down. Such “counter-cyclical” fiscal policy would be disallowed under a BBA. The ability to run larger deficits in weak economies is an especially valuable fiscal tool when you consider that states must balance their budgets. In the depths of the Great Recession, when I was working for the Obama administration and tracking the impact of our anti-recessionary measures, I vividly recall how states were forced to cut spending and lay off workers, which exacerbated the downturn. State fiscal relief—resources that quickly flowed to the states from the feds—turned out to be among the most potent policies we implemented. Simply put, during a recession, the ship of state is taking on water and the only guy with a bucket is Uncle Sam. A BBA would take away this bucket too.But it gets even worse. Under a BBA, as budget analyst Richard Kogan points out in a must read recent analysis, Social Security and Medicare benefits could not be paid out of their trust funds unless the government accounts are in surplus, a rare occurrence. That’s because outlays in a given year, from whatever source, cannot exceed tax receipts. Nor, as Kogan stresses, could the government offset a financial collapse or the loss of bank deposits or guaranteed private pensions, even though both are insured by government agencies with reserves on hand.The amendment does build in a waiver process, for, potentially, these types of developments. But waiving the BBA calls for a supermajority in both chambers, and I do not for a moment trust Congress to act quickly, if at all, when deficit spending is needed to avoid unnecessary economic pain. That’s why most anti-recessionary programs are set up as “automatic stabilizers:” they kick in based on need, not politics.You might be asking: How can the same group that just recently voted for trillions of dollars in a deficit-financed tax cut now call for a BBA? Easy. They’re not real deficit hawks. They’re deficit chicken hawks. The BBA is largely a show vote, much like the dozens they took on repealing Obamacare. It’s a signal to constituents that they truly do long to cease their fiscal recklessness, but simply can’t because those profligate BBA opponents refuse to provide them with the only thing that will stop their endless deficit spending: the fiscal handcuffs of a BBA.But it’s not just for show. Consider that even with the White House and Congressional majorities, Republicans have been unable to cut entitlements. They haven’t even been able to cut their primary targets in this space: Medicaid or SNAP. So, instead of directly legislating such cuts, they’re trying to come around the back, by starving the government of revenues while touting the virtues of balanced budgets. It’s a simple recipe: aggressively reduce taxes—especially for the wealthy—while ensuring that tax increases can never be entertained, thus resulting in rising deficits. Then, rend your garments in despair and shout about the need for balanced budgets (while ignoring that your phony growth predictions once again failed to materialize). And since you’ve taken new revenues off the table, there’s only one way to get there: Shrink the government.How’s that working out? Actually, not so well. For this year and next year, the tax law adds over $400 billion to the deficit, about two percent of GDP. But the spending deal passed last month adds over another percentage point (about $250 billion).

The Republican Party’s message—"we can’t stop spending without it!”—is true. In fact, it’s worse: “who’s up for tax cuts, round two?!”And this, I fear, is where we’re stuck for the foreseeable fiscal future. Republicans will try to keep cutting taxes, as that’s key to rewarding their donors and shrinking government. Both sides will keep raising spending because there’s apparently no political or economic cost of doing so.Until there is. It is extremely likely that we’ll head into the next downturn with higher deficits and debt than in any recession since the 1940s (when WWII inflated the national debt). It is equally likely that this will give conservatives the same rationale to not respond to the recession that they’d get from a BBA. They’ll point to the elevated deficit and debt, ignore their own roll in its elevation, and essentially argue, “we’d love to help, but our hands are tied. We simply can’t afford to spend any more.”In fact, as long as there’s no BBA, their hands won’t be tied, but the result could be the same: the implementation of austere, damaging, and unnecessarily painful fiscal policy at precisely the wrong economic moment.

This is how Stormy Daniels described the man who threatened her to keep quiet about her one-night-stand with President Trump.On Tuesday morning, Daniels and her relentless barrister Michael Avenatti appeared on ABC’s The View to share a forensic sketch of the alleged bully and to announce a $100,000 reward for anyone who could identify him. The nameless tough guy looked bizarrely similar to NFL star Tom Brady.Daniels described the creep as “well-dressed” and said that “nothing was alarming about the way he looked at first.”She reiterated the story she shared during her 60 Minutes interview last month, when she revealed that a mystery man intimidated her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011. The guy’s threats came soon after In Touch magazine interviewed her about her alleged romp and 10-month relationship with The Donald.“Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,” the thug warned as Daniels, who was with her baby daughter, collected a diaper bag from her car.“That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom,” the tough guy added, before walking away.The porn star—who is suing to quash the “hush agreement” about her alleged tryst with Trump—says she never saw the man again. But Daniels told Anderson Cooper that “If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know” his face.While speaking to the women of The View, Daniels said the warning came while she was recovering from having a baby. She was taking “mommy and me” workout classes, and her daughter was in a rear-facing car seat. Daniels said she was in the parking lot of a women’s center when she noticed the nameless man walking toward her. She assumed he was somebody’s husband who was waiting for a class to be over.

I didn’t want my family to find out that way,” Daniels added. “I didn’t want my life turned upside down.”Meanwhile, Avenatti announced people could email information on the threatener to [email\xa0protected]. The address elicited chuckles from the co-hosts. “We know that someone knows something,” Avenatti said, adding that the man likely bragged or told someone about it. “We’re going to get to the bottom of this.”Tuesday’s show-and-tell comes one day after Daniels attended a hearing for Trump’s loyal fixer, Michael Cohen, in Manhattan federal court.Indeed, Avenatti canceled the big reveal last week after the FBI raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room. The feds were reportedly seeking records related to Cohen’s payment to Daniels, and his role in silencing ex-Playmate Karen McDougal, who received hush money from the parent company of the National Enquirer.Before Cohen’s search warrant made headlines, when there was a lull in the torrent of Stormy news, Avenatti teased his client’s pursuit of the unidentified bruiser.On April 7, Daniels’ attorney teased “a major announcement in the coming days” on Twitter relating to Team Stormy’s efforts to identify the strongman. “You can run but you can’t hide,” Avenatti tweeted, alongside the hashtag #thugsearch.The following day, Avenatti tweeted a photo of Daniels with Lois Gibson, a renowned forensic artist. Gibson holds the Guinness World Records title for “Most criminals positively identified due to the composites of one artist.”Avenatti told CNN’s New Day on April 9 that he’d release a composite sketch of the creep who allegedly threatened Daniels—and a “significant reward” for anyone who can identify the stranger. \xa0The sketch comes amid a heated legal battle between the porn actress, and the president and Cohen. And as Cohen battles federal prosecutors over the communications seized during the search.Daniels has filed a lawsuit to void a nondisclosure agreement she signed weeks before the 2016 election. She received $130,000 from Cohen in exchange for her silence over her affair with Trump.The porn actress argues the NDA is invalid because Trump never signed it. (Cohen’s LLC, Essential Consultants, was the only other signatory on the agreement.) She also claims that because Cohen spoke publicly about the NDA, he breached their contract.While Daniels’ counsel is angling for a public trial, Trump’s attorneys are fighting to push their dispute into private arbitration. After the 60 Minutes segment, Cohen sent Daniels a cease-and-desist letter over her statements on the Las Vegas goon.Brent Blakely, an attorney for Cohen, delivered Avenatti a missive denying Cohen sent a stranger to frighten Daniels. “I hereby demand that you and your client cease and desist from making any further false and defamatory statements about my client,” Blakely wroteThe Trump loyalist is under investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations, the Washington Post reported. Last week’s raid came hours after Avenatti filed court papers in opposition to Cohen’s motion to compel arbitration. In court filings, Avenatti argues that Cohen’s company is not a party to the arbitration agreement inked with Daniels. Rather, he says, the contract is between DD (David Dennison, believed to be Donald Trump) and PP (Daniels’ alias, Peggy Peterson).Daniels submitted a declaration under her real name—Stephanie Clifford—stating that she believed Trump was a party to the NDA when she signed it.“When I signed the Settlement Agreement and Side Letter Agreement, it was my understanding that Donald Trump was a party to the Settlement Agreement and that he was going to sign both documents,” Daniels said in the court filing.Daniels added: “Until approximately February of this year, I was unaware that Mr. Trump did not sign the Settlement Agreement, and I had no idea that Mr. Trump would later claim that he was not a party to the Settlement Agreement.”Daniels said that if she’d known Trump wasn’t going to sign the documents, “I would have never signed either document nor would I have accepted the $130,000 payment.”Meanwhile, in his own declaration, Avenatti said Trump’s legal team—including his attorney Charles Harder—has been unable to answer whether the president was involved with Daniels’ hush agreement.Avenatti said he asked Harder “point-blank” whether Trump knew of the deal during a March 21 conference. Harder “evaded my question and would not provide a straight answer,” Avenatti stated. Harder allegedly told Avenatti, “We don’t know.”“When I pressed him further and stated that it was incredulous that such a basic questioncould not be answered, and inquired as to why he didn’t simply ask his client Mr. Trump, Mr. Harder further responded with ‘We haven’t done the research yet,’” Avenatti said in court papers. Earlier this month, Trump broke his silence on the Stormy soap opera vexing the White House.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump denied having any knowledge of the hush deal with the porn star and director.Asked why Cohen made the payment to Daniels, Trump responded: “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.”"},
 {'title': 'John Kelly to Scott Pruitt: The Scandals Need to Stop',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The day after Scott Pruitt was called by President Donald Trump, who reportedly told him to “keep your chin up” amid a torrent of controversy, the EPA chief got another phone call from a top White House official that was noticeably less encouraging.Chief of Staff John Kelly wanted to know, after revelations had surfaced that Pruitt had been renting living space in Washington, D.C., from a pair of high-powered lobbyists—one of whom was lobbying his agency at the time—what other shoes, if any, were going to drop. Is there anything else that “hasn’t come out” yet, Kelly asked, according to three Trump administration sources. The chief of staff then impressed upon Pruitt that, though he has the full public confidence of President Trump for now, the flow of negative and damning stories needed to stop soon, as one source briefed on the contents of the call described.“[It] was not a friendly buck-up call at all,” is how another Trump administration official described the conversation to The Daily Beast.Shortly thereafter, The Atlantic reported that Pruitt had defied the White House and directed his staff to give raises to a pair of employees under an obscure provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which gives the administrator wide latitude over short-term staffing decisions prompted by an emergency or other unexpected development. (Pruitt denied any knowledge of the raises in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday afternoon.)According to two sources with knowledge of the situation, Kelly and other senior White House officials were blindsided by major details in The Atlantic’s article, left frustrated and wondering if Pruitt and the EPA still weren’t conveying damaging news to the West Wing.The account of that Kelly-Pruitt exchange—as conveyed to The Daily Beast—notably differs from earlier reports on the exchange, which described it largely as cordial and encouraging. That may be because even those inside the administration say it is difficult to get a firm read on the current relationship between the White House and the EPA, save for that there is a growing level of discord between officials at each entity. Multiple officials contacted for this story acknowledged that there are several competing narratives emerging this week within the EPA and West Wing regarding even the tenor of the phone call and the current state of Pruitt-world.As controversies surrounding Pruitt proliferate, he has found himself in an all-too-familiar position for senior Trump officials: unsure of his longevity, receiving assurances in public and slight admonishments in private, all the time at the mercy of a temperamental president’s whims.Some EPA officials remain uneasy with elements of the White House, leading most recently to the EPA not responding to a request from the West Wing to turn over records related to Pruitt’s official travel habits for fear that they’d be strategically leaked, as The Daily Beast previously reported. On Monday, Politico reported that Kelly has even weighed having Pruitt sacked in “the coming months as part of a wave of ousters of top officials.”But EPA officials know that the president often charts his own course in high-profile staffing decisions, and feel that, regardless of the views of others in the West Wing, Pruitt will be just fine if he can stay in Trump’s good graces. Asked about the situation at a Wednesday afternoon briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that “we’re reviewing the situation” and that “when we have had the chance to have a deeper dive on it, we’ll let you know the outcomes of that.”Pruitt owes his good standing with the president primarily to his success in implementing the Trump administration’s environmental agenda, which has entailed significant rollbacks of Obama-era regulations designed to curb pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Though other Cabinet officials have been ousted for ethics problems—many similar to the ones facing Pruitt— their departures were due more to their limited success in effectively implementing the White House’s policy objectives. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned in the wake of a failure to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act. And former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin faced significant opposition from White House officials and outside allies who felt that he was not aggressive enough introducing private market reforms to the troubled veterans health system.Whether Pruitt can maintain his standing with the president even with relative success on the policy front is still an open question, however. That’s particularly true in the wake of the story in The Atlantic, which suggested that Pruitt and his staff circumvented White House staffing directives.Making matters worse for Pruitt was a Wednesday report from The Washington Post that said Pruitt had used the same Safe Drinking Water Act provision to hire a number of employees absent White House input, including two former lobbyists who might otherwise have been barred from the posts by ethics rules imposed by Trump by executive order weeks after taking office.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Trump Advisers Steve Mnuchin and Peter Navarro Got Into a Profanity-Laced ‘Screaming Match’ on the China Trip',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Tensions between two top Donald Trump economic advisers spilled over during a recent trip to China earlier this month, resulting in what was described by administration officials as a “screaming match.” The confrontation, which took place between Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Peter Navarro, came during a very important stretch of trade negotiations for this White House. And it underscored the deep divisions that have developed within the president’s economic team over a key pillar of the president’s agenda. Navarro, a hardliner on trade, and Mnuchin, representative of the free-trader camp, have been at loggerheads for weeks over trade negotiations with China. That animus has grown deeper as it’s become clearer that the White House’s strongest protectionist voices are losing the internal argument. According to four sources familiar with the matter, on the Thursday of the official visit, the U.S. team of principals—including Mnuchin, Navarro, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and chief White House economist Larry Kudlow—had scheduled meetings with Chinese officials.The following day, Mnuchin, according to two sources, held a closed-door meeting with his Chinese counterpart, without the other U.S. officials, forgoing two negotiating sessions featuring the full U.S. delegation that Navarro wanted. After he caught wind of Mnuchin’s one-on-one, Navarro exploded at the Treasury secretary. The confrontation devolved into several minutes of sniping, swearing, several “fucks,” and insults hurled between the two men. The confrontation happened on the lawn in front of the building where the talks were being conducted, according to a person familiar with what took place.The White House did not respond to comment on the exchange of words. News of the confrontation was first reported by Axios. Another source familiar with the verbal argument characterized the incident on the China excursion as more of a “tense confrontation” between the two senior officials. Sources also noted that a similarly heated disagreement went down between Navarro and Ross during the visit to China. However, people familiar with the incident and general internal feuding note that the true target of Navarro’s ire is Trump’s Treasury secretary. Mnuchin and Navarro differ sharply on key Trump trade agenda items. Most recently, they have feuded over Trump’s stated openness to easing punitive measures on Chinese electronics firm ZTE Technologies—measures that were designed to punish the company for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and other nations. According to those close to Navarro, he sees Mnuchin as the leading advocate of such a move, which Navarro considers anathema to the tough stance toward China that he has encouraged the president to take since assuming office.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Navarro has been excluded from trade talks with China on Thursday. Other leading Trump economic advisers are expected to fill out the U.S. delegation, potentially including Mnuchin, Lighthizer, and Ross.The Daily Beast confirmed that Kudlow was also set to be in attendance—and that Navarro was not.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Roger Stone: Sam Nunberg Is a ‘Lying Asshole’ and ‘Psycho’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Two former aides to Donald Trump waged a war of words against each other this week, using cable news and social media as their battlefields.Roger Stone, a longtime confidant of Trump’s, took to his personal Instagram page on Thursday to call fellow ex-aide Sam Nunberg, a man who once viewed Stone as a mentor, a “psycho” and a “lying asshole.” That post came in response to an appearance by Nunberg on MSNBC yesterday in which he said that Stone was trying to curry favor with Trump by suggesting he had met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange prior to the 2016 presidential election. “He’s always trying to ingratiate himself to Trump. I don’t care about Trump. It’s irrelevant to me if I have a relationship with him again. Roger does. They have a long relationship,” Nunberg said in the clip. Nunberg said that he assumed Stone was lying when he first told him about the meeting.Stone posted another video of himself smoking a cigar late last night in which he went further to criticize his former friend. “Sam Nunberg is a cocaine addict,” Stone said. “And any news organization that takes anything he said seriously is courting a serious lawsuit. Coke head,” he concluded taking another puff of the cigar.Earlier this month, Nunberg made a number of headlines during a cable news blitz in which he initially bragged he would not cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. He would later testify before a grand jury. In a phone conversation with The Daily Beast, Nunberg said he understood Stone would be annoyed. “I understand why Roger is upset,” Nunberg said. “I shouldn't have used the word lie, he's not a liar. In any case, I do not believe he met with Assange.”Stone is a subject in the special counsel's investigation and has maintained that his claim about meeting Assange was “a joke.” "},
 {'title': 'The Trump-Hannity Relationship Takes Conservatives One More Step Toward the Moral Low Ground',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Conservatives, including myself, have endlessly complained that the mainstream media has long been too cozy with Democrats in power. Now it's time for conservatives to talk about Sean Hannity.\xa0Reports that Fox News host Sean Hannity is so close to Trump “that some White House aides have dubbed him the unofficial chief of staff” probably deserve more attention—and (for those of us who want to be consistent) condemnation. Now, I’m aware that Hannity wavers on whether the title “journalist” accurately describes his role. “Entertainer” is probably more accurate, but when you anchor of an hour-long primetime TV show on what is ostensibly a cable “news” network, you have a responsibility to to disclose potential conflicts of interest to your audience. It matters not that Hannity is a “pundit” and not a straight reporter. As Jonah Goldberg has pointed out, being an opinion journalist does not absolve one of this responsibility. People need to trust that our opinions are really our opinions. Whether one cares about upholding ethical standards, this makes it impossible for conservatives to complain the next time a Democrat cozies up to a member of the press. Back in March, conservative John Ziegler authored a column titled, “A Comprehensive List of Things Republicans Can No Longer Legitimately Criticize Thanks to Trump.” It’s time to add one more to the list. The truth is that for years, conservatives had every right to complain about Democrats and the media. Examples are rife.At least one of FDR’s speeches was actually written by a reporter covering him. As Jonathan Alter recounts in his book, The Defining Moment, after one of Roosevelt’s speeches was panned by the press, the president challenged New York Herald Tribune’s Ernest K. Lindley to write a better speech for him—and he did! Alter goes on to suggest that this would “get him fired for unethical behavior,” but I’m not so sure. According to his Washington Post obituary, “Mr. Lindley’s prolific literary production included the first book about Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt—A Career in Progressive Democracy. He also wrote The Roosevelt Revolution—First Phase, Half Way with Roosevelt and How War Came—U.S. Foreign Policy from the Fall of France to Pearl Harbor.” The torch then passed to a new generation of cronies. According to The New York Times, Arthur Krock, the paper’s Washington bureau chief, “rewrote, without credit, Why England Slept, thereby rendering it publishable, awarded his personal valet to the young Congressman John Kennedy upon his arrival in Washington and, later, ‘worked like hell,’ in his own words, in a successful lobbying effort to obtain the Pulitzer Prize for Profiles in Courage.”But Krock wasn’t JFK’s only powerful journalistic buddy. While covering JFK as Washington Bureau Chief of\xa0for Newsweek, Ben Bradlee was, as John Dickerson writes, “straddling two worlds, playing the role of both reporter and friend” with Kennedy.In a 2014 column for Newsbusters, conservative Jeffrey Lord alleged that Bradlee suppressed negative information about the Kennedys. “Once upon a time Walter Cronkite really was ‘the most trusted man in America,’ Lord lamented. “But those days are long gone. And the blame for this total lack of trust lies with the American media itself.” Indeed, as Cronkite, himself, confessed: “I don’t know why to this day I got away with it” (regarding hiding his liberal leanings).But get away with it, they did. And for decades. As recently as 2009, Politico reported that ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent George Stephanopoulos participated in daily conference calls with then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, as well as Democratic strategists James Carville and Paul Begala. This was the kind of thing that used to make conservative heads explode. But at least Stephanopoulos was going through President Obama’s chief of staff.

Chalk this up as just the latest example of conservatives wanting to “fight fire with fire” and ape the other side. But it also means surrendering the moral high ground and becoming no better than your adversaries.As John Ziegler explains, “Once you have defended and accepted certain behavior from a president, it is awfully difficult,\xa0even in a world where hypocrisy is now longer seen as politically lethal, to claim that similar acts are unacceptable for any other elected office.”Donald Trump and Sean Hannity are doing the kind of things that conservative Republicans used to rightly abhor.

 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt’s Lobbyist Landlord Being Pressured to Leave His Firm',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The lobbyist who rented Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt a room in his Capitol Hill townhouse is being pressured to retire from his firm earlier than previously planned, The Daily Beast has learned.J. Steven Hart, the chairman of Williams & Jensen, had been considering leaving this year, four sources familiar with his thinking said. But the emergence of the scandal surrounding his association with Pruitt has expedited talk of his departure as officials at the powerhouse lobbying shop grapple with the resulting bad press. Hart is under pressure internally to make a quicker break amid concern that his continued presence on the firm’s masthead has become problematic for certain clients. But others inside Williams & Jensen do not want to give off the impression that Hart acted improperly in renting a townhouse to Pruitt—an implication that would come should he leave the firm in the midst of the Pruitt-related fallout. One source told The Daily Beast that no final decision is imminent. But another said that exit plans have already been discussed between Hart and other members of the firm’s brass. Hart is one of the most influential lobbyists in D.C. having spent decades pushing the business interests of some of the nation’s largest companies in the halls of Congress. His days as an influence-peddling hustler have long since passed, with contemporaries saying he now plays more of a ceremonial, rainmaker role. But he remains one of the biggest draws at Williams & Jensen, owing to the rolodex he has amassed over decades of work. That rolodex is, in part, how the Pruitt apartment deal came to be. Hart hails from Oklahoma and both donated to and organized fundraising events for Pruitt when he served as attorney general of the state. When Pruitt came to D.C. and was in need of a place to stay, an intermediary put the two back in touch, a source familiar with the arrangement told The Daily Beast. Hart’s wife, Vicki Hart, is the co-owner of the townhouse that was offered to the EPA chief.A spokesman for William & Jensen declined to comment, though previously, Hart has noted that the condominium “is not owned by [the firm], its partners, or any other employees of the firm, and any suggestion that Administrator Pruitt’s short-term rental of one of its bedrooms in 2017 resulted in undue influence for the firm or its clients with business before the EPA is simply false.”The Pruitt arrangement is now a part of Trump-era infamy. Pruitt paid just $50 a night for the room he rented, which also served as a site for Williams & Jensen-hosted fundraisers for GOP lawmakers. Pruitt insisted that neither Hart nor the firm had any clients with business before the EPA at the time. But there were several companies who were lobbying the agency and/or had pending legal matters before it. The living arrangement caused headaches in real time as well. Pruitt was described by numerous sources as a disastrous tenant, with one comparing him to Owen Wilson’s character in You, Me and Dupree. According to three people familiar with events, Pruitt would not take out the trash during his time staying at the townhouse believing that a cleaning service would do it for him. There was no cleaning service that came with the apartment, however. And the garbage bags piled up to the point that Vicki Hart was forced to tell him to put them in the canister and to take that canister out to the street the next time he left the building. “Tenant from hell,” said one source.The EPA declined to comment on Pruitt’s trash habits and condo-guest conduct.Pruitt was initially supposed to stay from February through April 1, 2017. But he repeatedly asked to extend his lease. Ultimately, the Harts had to inform him that they had plans to rent his room to another tenant and, according to Politico, change the locks so that he could physically no longer stay.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Seth Rich Family Spokesman Sues for Being Called DNC ‘Hitman’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Conservative media claimed the death of a Democratic National Committee staffer would lead to scandal for the party. So far the conspiracy theorists are the only ones facing legal action.After the death of Seth Rich in July 2016, right-wingers pushed a conspiracy theory claiming Rich had leaked DNC documents to Wikileaks and that Democratic operatives had ordered his murder in retaliation. (He was killed in a suspected robbery attempt and no suspect has been arrested.) The theory was debunked by law enforcement and resulted in a retraction from Fox News, which had claimed Rich was in contact with Wikileaks. But Rich’s family and their associates say they faced harassment from the theory’s true believers. On Monday, Brad Bauman, an unpaid spokesperson for the Rich family filed a defamation suit against a Fox News insider, a far-right media group and its founder, and an InfoWars contributor. Bauman claims the defendants smeared him as a DNC “hitman” who had been “assigned” to cover up Rich’s death.Bauman’s is not the first lawsuit stemming from Rich’s death. Rich’s parents and brother separately filed suit against the conspiracy’s peddlers, accusing them of defamation and negligence in their reporting. A retired detective quoted in Fox News’ article sued the network, claiming the network \xa0recklessly pushed the story because President Donald Trump had read an unpublished draft, and had wanted to see the story go live.Bauman’s suit alleges a pattern of harassment now familiar to people close to Rich. Shortly after Rich’s murder on July 10, 2016, the 27-year-old DNC staffer’s parents enlisted Bauman to speak for the grieving family. But some conspiracy theorists claimed Bauman had a more sinister mission.InfoWars contributor Howard Heavin began referring to Bauman as a “DNC political hitman,” videos quoted in Bauman’s suit show. Other defendants claimed the DNC had “assigned” Bauman to the Rich family to cover up what they claimed was Rich’s plot to leak DNC documents. Fringe-right new site America First Media and its founder Matt Couch, both of whom are named as defendants in Bauman’s case, claimed Bauman was a DNC “crisis fixer” involved in a “cover-up.”And Ed Butowsky, a financier and Fox News insider who reportedly helped organize Fox’s retracted article on Rich, told multiple media outlets Bauman was lying about Rich’s death. Bauman told right-wing conspiracy site WorldNetDaily that the DNC had “assigned” Bauman to the Rich family, and told CNN that Bauman was “simply a hired guy who will say anything” including “crafting a lie” about Rich’s death.Even after Fox New retracted its story, America First Media and Couch waged a deliberate campaign of harassment against Bauman, he alleges. His suit points to a January 2018 tweet in which Couch states one of AFM’s 2018 goals a “continue to be the reason Brad Bauman buys stock in Tums,” referring to the heartburn medication sometimes taken by people experiencing stress or anxiety.Bauman also accuses an AFM employee of publicizing his phone number and email address.But what was bad publicity for Bauman was good money for AFM, he alleges. In their articles on Bauman and the Rich family, AFM linked to a GoFundMe page, which claimed to raise money for the outlet’s investigation into Rich’s murder. The GoFundMe raised more than $20,000, Bauman alleges. After the page was removed, AFM relocated its fundraising efforts to the sites Fundly and Patreon.As of mid-May, Couch was still tweeting fundraiser for AFM’s Seth Rich investigation.'},
 {'title': 'The Podcast Killed Kevin Williamson, But God Save the Podcast!',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In the wake of Kevin Williamson’s being fired by The Atlantic (and also on the heels of the Bari Weiss controversy at The New York Times), a big debate about the utility of opinion columns is taking place. In this milieu, a certain newsroom narrative has emerged that says media companies should “hire more reporters, not more opinion/take writers”—as The Washington Post’s Mark Berman averred (in what was, ironically, a pretty provocative “take”). Part of this debate involves media outlets asking whether there is an audience for thoughtful, but not gratuitously provocative, takes. And the answer is yes. You just have to listen to them—not read them.\xa0That’s not to say that there aren’t still good columns and essays to be found. But it is to say that, the best place to turn now days for civil conversation and thoughtful commentary is not to the opinion section of your newspaper, but to iTunes or Stitcher. “I’ve thought a lot about why podcasts—mine and others—have done so well,” says David Axelrod, the former senior advisor to President Obama who now hosts The Axe Files podcast.\xa0“What I’ve concluded, based on what people who download my podcast volunteer to me, is that they are hungry for an antidote to all the noise and the low-calorie junk food that litters the media environment.”People hungering for a serious intellectual nourishment found it recently when Jamie Weinstein interviewed Ta-Nehisi Coates on the topic of race. It was a prime example of why the best opinions being expressed right now are happening not in print, not on TV, but on podcasts. And I’m not the only one saying it. “There’s not enough deep but respectful disagreement in political debate today, wrote The New York Times David Leonhardt. “The\xa0recent discussion\xa0between Jamie Weinstein and Ta-Nevis Coates is a welcome exception.” “It was an absolutely fascinating discussion, just the right blend of civility and intellectual tension,” raved Jonathan Chait. “Podcasting still offers hope for more freewheeling discussion. If we can keep it weird.”The ability to have nuanced discussions, Weinstein tells me, is precisely why he decided to launch a podcast. “I really find podcasting more of an antidote to the soundbite culture of cable news, where debates are often artificial and outrage manufactured,” says Weinstein, whose eponymous podcast, The Jamie Weinstein Show, runs at National Review. We’ve nearly destroyed all other forms of media. Maybe that’s why even the entertainment world is looking to podcasts as a source of fresh material. According to Vulture, podcasting has “emerged as Hollywood’s hottest new source for material and intellectual property” because the “podcasting universe remains a creatively vibrant space where new ideas and creators can be tested in a marketplace with relatively little risk…” Speaking of testing new ideas in the marketplace with little risk, a while back, Ezra Klein said that he is “willing to try out ideas here [on his podcast] and say things that are not fully thought through and make a mistake in how I say something in a way that I am absolutely not willing to do in other places where there’s a lot more drive-by reading.” Klein’s theory is that people have to go out of their way to subscribe to a podcast, just like they once had to go out of their way to bookmark a blog before social media. In this paradigm, readers and listeners opt-in to becoming part of a community and, thus, are willing to grant the content creator a “more generous” or “contextual interpretation.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Jonah Goldberg, who cut his teeth blogging in the early days at National Review Online, is relatively new to the podcasting world, but agrees that podcasting “allows you to ‘think out loud’ in a way that blogging used to.”But here’s where I’m starting to get a little worried. With this newfound popularity and attention, the danger is that the same pressures that have dumbed down TV and “think pieces” will eventually get around to destroying podcasts. What is more, the idea that podcasting is a safe space seems to be either naïve or antiquated. After all, the reason Kevin Williamson got fired by the Atlantic is that his enemies dug up some controversial things he said during a 2014 podcast. And not to compare the two, but upon reflection, it was his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast that was the beginning of the end of alt-righter Milo Yiannopoulos. It’s probably fair to say that we all have to be careful what we say, regardless of the medium. But podcasting can, and should, offer some good lessons for the political columnists (and, more importantly, their assignment editors) who are looking to remain relevant in a world where it is suddenly popular to hate on columnists. Contrary to those who say that reporting is all that matters, there will always be a need for those who can help people analyze and contextualize the news—and for people who can challenge our thinking, and encourage us to think different. There will always be a place for people who want to have civil conversations with smart people (not just shouting matches). Today, it is podcasting—mostly unsupervised, often a labor of love, frequently uninterested in ratings and revenue—that is providing the best content. The least professional medium is delivering the best product—which tells me that the problems with the “opinion” industry have a lot to do with business incentives. \xa0There’s a reason that former bloggers like Klein and Goldberg have evolved into podcasters. As Matthew Yglesias recently observed: “Remember blogs? We had a blog lineup and folks were just posting things totally unedited. It was wild.” Yes, it was. And then the man figured out how to co-opt it and monetize it. And it’s hard for me to complain about earning a paycheck. But I suspect a lot of the criticism of our “think piece” culture is the product of business demands—not the wishes of columnists. Maybe there’s something to be said about how the shift away from wild and wooly world of blogging to edited opinion journalism has cramped our discourse, limiting it to “acceptable” opinion that doesn’t offend the suits at The Atlantic. Podcasting still offers hope for more freewheeling discussion. If we can keep it weird. "},
 {'title': 'For the Right Price, You Can Buy Glenn Beck’s Private Jet',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Glenn Beck, then enigmatic conservative media firebrand, appears to be selling off his assets as his media enterprise downsizes. Earlier this year, Beck engaged in conversations with popular right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro to buy or partner with Beck’s right-leaning news network The Blaze, which has been hit with several rounds of massive layoffs over the past three years.Now, he’s getting rid of his plane. According to Federal Aviation Administration records and a listing on Controller, a site that sells used aircraft, Beck recently put his 1966 DC9-15, up for sale. The jet for sale on Controller has the registration number N8860. The FAA’s website shows that that registration number is assigned to an aircraft that belongs to Mercury Radio Arts, Beck’s radio production company. The asking price for the plane is not listed. The listing for the two engine plane that’s ferried Beck from his home in Texas to New York boasts of “2014 custom paint,” and “2014 airframe and engine inspections,” among other features.Beck’s opulent spending habits have been a source of consternation at his media empire. Employees at The Blaze previously lamented that Beck bought a Maybach sedan and kept his jet—which was expensive to operate and maintain—amid massive layoffs at the company in 2015. The jet was purchased by Beck’s radio company, Mercury Radio Arts, that same year from right-wing billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife for a million dollars. It had once been adorned with a skull-and-crossbones on the tail. Beck did not return a request for comment. Beck has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration, and campaigned with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Since Trump’s election, The Blaze has seen a notable traffic decline and has severely downsized its staff. Beck has previously criticized members of congress who’ve supported tax carve-outs for private jet travel, and has railed against environmentalists who fly in private jets. But he is a long-established champion of that particular form of travel. In a 2014 open letter to his daughter, Beck said private air travel is the only luxury that would improve her life.“Private jet travel is the only material thing that can actually change your life,” Beck said, according to his personal website. “However, refined manner, gentleness, meekness, kindness, will be the only currency of any true value.”'},
 {'title': '‘She Should Have Fought Back. Other People Did’: Inside Gina Haspel’s Black Site',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Ahead of her Senate reckoning, Gina Haspel’s defenders in U.S. intelligence circles have adopted the fallback position that she’ll be a check on Donald Trump as his CIA director. But attorneys for a man whose torture Haspel oversaw 15 years ago consider that farcical. “Obviously, this person should not be the head of the CIA or the head of anything,” Nancy Hollander, who represents Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri, told The Daily Beast. “Under the Convention Against Torture that the U.S. is a party to, we’re obligated to pursue and prosecute torturers, not give them promotions. What does it say to the world that the person who may have been directly responsible, and certainly was indirectly responsible for this torture, who never stood up and said ‘Don’t do it,’ is now the person who might be leading the very agency we know committed that torture?” Hollander’s client was tortured at a black site in Thailand that Haspel ran in late 2002. Declassified CIA documents indicate that Nashiri’s torture, which his attorneys say has left lasting mental damage, was controversial within the agency. But those documents provide no indication that Haspel opposed it, let alone stopped it—particularly when CIA headquarters pushed to intensify the torture at a subsequent black site. Interrogators who didn’t work directly for Haspel even engaged in a miniature revolt over torture that they considered egregious. “The person we know most about, whom the [Senate torture report] called the ‘chief interrogator,’ he’s the only person we’re expressly aware protested Nashiri’s torture—after torturing Nashiri for quite awhile,” said Michel Paradis, a senior counsel with the Pentagon’s Office of Military Commissions who has aided Nashiri’s defense. “That’s the only one we’ve found from the black sites.” Haspel goes before the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday morning and leaked excerpts of her opening statement indicate she will tell the panel that “under my leadership, CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” But her nomination is so far from assured, even after an intense and unusual public push from the CIA to confirm the three-decade agency veteran, that she considered quitting late last week. While the agency has emphasized everything about Haspel’s career except torture—pushing her basketball fandom and a pre-torture meeting with Mother Teresa—Trump, a vocal torture enthusiast, indicated that he considered her torture record, or “being too tough on terrorists,” a virtue. With Senate margins such that Haspel will need to win over at least some Democrats for confirmation, CIA veterans have suggested Haspel will act as a bulwark against Trump. A letter of support signed by 72 retired agency officers, released Tuesday night, described her as “a person who commits to the highest standards of conduct and ethical behavior” (PDF). Barack Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, who unsuccessfully fought to make Haspel clandestine-service chief, assured Haspel would provide “unvarnished, apolitical, objective intelligence input to Donald Trump.” A counselor for Eric Holder, Amy Jeffress, called Haspel “committed to the rule of law.” John Bennett, a former senior agency official, recently told The New York Times, “If she’s not confirmed, who knows who the president would turn to as an alternative?” But when Haspel oversaw the brutality inflicted on Nashiri, torture was “unlawful then as it is unlawful now,” said Hollander. “I don’t think she would stand up to Trump at all.” “I see this as extremely problematic,” said Navy Lieutenant Alaric Piette, another Nashiri attorney. As an enlisted SEAL on 9/11, Piette, who first expressed doubts about Haspel to the Washington Examiner on Monday, conceded that he “understand[s] the impulse to torture.” But he said he considered Haspel to have failed a critical post-9/11 test. “At a time when we needed professionalism and leadership, we got torture instead,” Piette told The Daily Beast. “As a defense attorney, I don’t think people should be defined by the worst thing we’ve ever done. We’re all greater than that. But at the same time, that doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be some consequences... I think it should be a bar for her rising up to that level.”‘ONLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS CONDUCT’Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Even under a legal definition concocted to provide the Central Intelligence Agency with maximal leeway to brutalize its captives, what Gina Haspel’s interrogators did to Nashiri qualifies as torture.In 2002, the year that the torture program began, the law was clear, and it was not on the CIA’s side. “Whoever outside the United States commits or attempts to commit torture shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both,” reads 18 USC 2340(A)(a). The prohibited acts were meant to apply to people in power—“a person acting under the color of law.” A further definition contained within the law expressly stipulates that anyone involved in torture, not merely the person directly conducting it, is committing a crime: “A person who conspires to commit an offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.”That summer, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel considered what the CIA proposed doing to its detainees. To provide the CIA with legal cover, attorneys John Yoo and Jay Bybee redefined torture narrowly, to “only the most egregious conduct,” and then denied that the agency proposals reached that threshold (PDF). Physical pain needed to be equivalent to “organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death” to count as torture, Yoo wrote on Aug. 1, 2002. For “purely mental pain or suffering to amount to torture under Section 2340,” he continued, “it must result in significant psychological harm of significant duration, e.g., lasting for months or even years.” That, it turned out, is what happened to Nashiri.Authorities in the United Arab Emirates seized Nashiri, who carried out the 2000 U.S.S. Cole bombing that killed 17 U.S. sailors, in Dubai in mid-October 2002. By Nov. 15, the CIA took him to the Thailand black site. Haspel was already in charge. The proposal Yoo signed off on implied that the agency would torture as a last resort. With Nashiri, it was a first resort. After obtaining “the necessary Headquarters authorization,” a 2004 CIA inspector general’s report found that “psychologist/interrogators began al-Nashiri’s interrogation using EITs immediately upon his arrival.” EITs, or enhanced interrogation techniques, are the CIA’s euphemism for torture. According to that same inspector general’s report, the relationship between cooperation and torture was not inversely proportional at the site Haspel ran. Nashiri provided information “on other terrorists during his first day of interrogation.” Yet it was on day 12, Nov. 26, that the agency waterboarded him. “A rag was placed over his forehead and eyes and water poured into his mouth until he began to choke and aspirate,” his lawyers told the Supreme Court in 2017. “The rag was then lowered, suffocating him with the water still in his throat, sinuses and lungs.” The black-site interrogators permitted Nashiri to “take 3-4 breaths” before proceeding with another simulated drowning. “On one occasion,” write Nashiri’s lawyers, Nashiri “was forced to keep his hands on the wall and denied food for three days.” On a different occasion, “they placed a broomstick behind [Nashiri’s] knees as he knelt and then placed his body backwards, pulling his knee joints apart ‘as he started to scream.’” While interrogators attempted “to put al-Nashiri in a standing stress position,” apparently while lifting him “off the floor by his arms while his arms were bound behind his back with a belt,” the CIA inspector general found, there was “concern that al-Nashiri’s arms might be dislocated from his shoulders.” At least one black-site official “said he had to intercede,” but with unspecified results.For “days,” according to Nashiri’s Supreme Court filing, CIA interrogators kept Nashiri in a “standing stress position” while placing him in “a coffin,” often termed a “large box.” When not locked in the coffin “between interrogations,” Nashiri was stuffed into what his lawyers say was a small box “the size of an office safe.” Amidst stagnant air and total darkness, the safe-sized box forced Nashiri “into a squatting fetal position that caused his extremities to swell.” Such interrogation “continued through 4 December 2002,” the 2004 CIA inspector-general report found. That date appears to be when the agency shut down the Thailand black site, out of fear of discovery and sent Nashiri, along with previous captive Abu Zubaydah, to a different black site in Poland. (A footnote in the 2014 Senate torture report says Nashiri’s torture resumed from “December 5-8” at a different site.) Haspel is not known to have gone to Poland. The brief and nonspecific biographical sketch the CIA released recently indicates she instead returned to the Counterterrorism Center (CTC), out of which the torture program operated. But by mid-December 2002, CTC was enmeshed in an internal argument about what to do with Nashiri. ‘A TRAIN WRECK WAITING TO HAPPEN’ Soon after Nashiri arrived in Poland, interrogators at this post-Haspel black site “judged al-Nashiri's cooperation and compliance by his engagement and willingness to answer questions,” according to the Senate torture report. Adds Paradis, the counsel who has aided in his defense: “Nashiri was cooperative instantly. His cooperativeness was never in doubt.” There is little evidence that interrogators under Haspel’s command at the Thai black site expressed reluctance or resistance to torture. But the next team of interrogators, which did not work directly for Haspel, promptly expressed both. The “consensus” of the interrogation team in Poland was that Nashiri was “compliant” and not “withholding important threat information,” December 2002-era CIA cables cited in the torture report said. Yet thousands of miles away, CTC had difficulty believing it, owing to what the Senate report considers an institutional article of faith that Nashiri must have possessed knowledge of forthcoming attacks. The interrogators cabled back a shot across headquarters’ bow: “[A] decision to resume enhanced measures must be grounded in fact and not general feelings.”CTC won. It deployed an unnamed officer to the black site to intensify Nashiri’s torture. That officer threatened Nashiri with death, racking an empty pistol near his head and revving a power drill while, the CIA inspector general’s report noted, Nashiri “stood naked and hooded.” Even though the other interrogators considered Nashiri to have been cooperating, the CTC-dispatched officer made what the CIA’s own inspector general understood were rape and death threats: “We could get your mother in here,” and “we can bring your family in here.” By late January 2003, Nashiri’s treatment was too much for an unidentified agency official whom the Senate torture report describes as the CIA’s chief of interrogations. In an email to colleagues titled CONCERNS OVER REFINED INTERROGATION PLAN FOR NASHIRI, the interrogations chief talked about quitting. A man whose presence, the Senate report found, would prompt Nashiri to “tremble in fear” believed the treatment went too far. “It is the assessment of the prior interrogators that [al-Nashiri] has been mainly truthful and is not withholding significant information. To continue to use enhanced technique[s] without clear indications that he [is] withholding important info is excessive and may cause him to cease cooperation on any level,” wrote the official, who called the torture program “a train wreak [sic] waiting to happen and I intend to get off the train before it happens.” The CIA tortured Nashiri for years before sending him to Guantanamo Bay in 2006, where he remains.It is unknown whether Haspel was involved in the post-Thailand debate over Nashiri. During the crucial years of 2003 and 2004, the height of the program’s operational tempo, very little is known, and the CIA has publicly acknowledged even less, about Haspel’s specific involvement. In 2014, when it wasn’t controversial to say so, former CIA top attorney John Rizzo wrote in his memoir that she “ran the interrogation program.” In 2018, a the day after The Daily Beast reported on that—with an on-record quote from Rizzo standing by his account—he suddenly denied the accuracy of his own words. Last year, attorneys for contract interrogators sought unsuccessfully to depose Haspel in a lawsuit brought by men who survived the torture program, joined by the relatives of one who didn’t. None of those men were kept in the Thailand black site, suggesting that Haspel had a higher-level vantage of their torture—she was “centrally involved,” the contractors’ attorney claimed. The harm Nashiri experienced from his torture did not end with his torture. Piette said he “clearly suffers from PTSD,” though classification limits Piette’s ability to talk about how that manifests itself. “It’s trust issues, his interpretation of events. The way he interprets events is through the filter of what happened to him, how that affected not just his psychology but straight-up brain physiology,” Piette said. Nashiri, in other words, has cleared the Justice Department’s 2002 threshold, upon which the CIA relied, that psychological harm had to last “for months or even years” to be illegal torture.‘SHE SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT BACK’ Only after Haspel became deputy director under Trump in February 17 did her official cover lift. (The contractors had originally sought to depose her under the name “Gina Doe.”) With her biography an official secret, and the risk of CIA selectively declassifying it to secure her confirmation, a host of Democratic senators and human-rights groups has demanded robust public disclosure. It hasn’t happened. The White House last week committed to providing secret documents about Haspel to only to senators, who are barred from discussing them publicly. The final tranche came to Capitol Hill on Monday. At least one senator who opposes Haspel—and who has warned that even more disturbing aspects of her record remain unknown—was unimpressed.“I have reviewed the classified materials and nothing I’ve seen has changed my assessment: if it were not for a cover-up by the CIA, Gina Haspel could not win confirmation,” Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. “If this secret nomination process goes ahead, it will be an out-and-out abandoning of the idea that Congress oversees nominees, and will set a terrible precedent that we’ll see over and over again.”Haspel’s agency defenders say that her involvement in torture must be understood in the crucible of 9/11. She took “the most demanding and least rewarding assignments in the War on Terror,” ex-CIA official Bennett said in March, because Haspel “felt it was her duty during the time of greatest anxiety and uncertainty for the American people in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.”Piette, the former Navy SEAL now representing Nashiri, says he can understand making mistakes during the “bad time” shortly after 9/11. “But we shouldn’t have anyone rewarded for those mistakes. We shouldn’t redefine someone’s mistakes as evidence of success. That’s where the danger to the rule of law comes in. It’s shifting the window, normalizing things that shouldn’t be normalized.” Perhaps, he said, Haspel’s nomination was “just a symptom” indicating that the normalization of torture has already occurred.“A lot of people in the CIA would probably agree that they should never have been in the business of detentions and interrogations,” continued Piette. “Forcing them to shift that mission is part of the problem. But that is the point when she should have fought back. Other people did. She just didn’t.” "},

  'body': "Whether it’s the election of Donald Trump as president, or the recent political scandals involving Missouri GOP Governor Eric Greitens, or former New York Democratic attorney general Eric Schneiderman, our system of elected politics has a problem baked into it: It attracts jerks. (Also—and I’m not saying correlation equals causation—but a disproportionate number of guys named “Eric.”)Now, some of this is simple math. If you were simply to take a random sampling of, say, 535 Americans (the size of the U.S. Congress), you would come up with a random assortment of criminals and rapists. (Some, I assume, would be good people. But the voters, to paraphrase Trump, “are not sending us their best.”)To some degree, I suspect it has always been this way, but there was a time when we at least pretended to send our best and brightest to Washington—when we entertained the notion that we wanted our elites to be better (and by “better,” I mean both more virtuous and more knowledgeable) than we are. Somewhere along the way, that changed. Our politicians started to (gasp!) reflect our voters. And people who had an outsized ambition started seeing political office as a way to scratch their itch—not just for power—but for national fame. Some careers have always been magnets for egomaniacs. Politics is one of them. And, unlike acting or sports (where talent is often a prerequisite), it’s easily accessible to the ambitious and egocentric. Leaving aside the president and his cabinet and retinue, there are 100 senators, 435 members of Congress, 50 governors, and thousands of members of state legislatures. That’s not to even mention mayors and city councilors, etc. Getting into politics is an attainable goal. Like being a local pastor, being a politician can give you a taste of fame and applause and notoriety—but it’s a lot more attainable than persuading an A & R Rep to sign your rock band. “Maybe this is a good model for politics? Anyone who wants to run for office should, automatically, be disqualified from holding it.”Let’s take a moment to reflect on the kind of personality disorder might make one attracted to politics. To be sure, there are people who have entirely noble aspirations about making the world a better place. But what kind of sane person thinks he can oust a four-term incumbent from his perch? What kind of normal person is especially good at getting on a phone and asking other people to send him thousands of dollars? And what kind of narcissist would you have to be to think that you—and you alone—can fix people’s problems? This is almost a self-selecting way to manufacture hubris. (These politicians are not people, they’re animals.)But politics isn’t content with merely attracting egomaniacs. It also creates them. Let’s say that you run for office for all the right reasons, convince yourself that all the hard work is for the cause of freedom and justice, and then manage to get elected to Congress. You will immediately then encounter money-hungry sycophantic consultants who will tell you how amazing you are. You will then hire a team of deferential staffers (who can be treated as personal servants in your little fiefdom), you will get to ride private elevators to the Capitol and exercise in the members-only gym, and you will face the temptation of thinking that you are better than other people—that you “deserve” to be in charge—that you are entitled. If this status comes with certain perks and rewards, then so be it. \xa0The old cliché about Washington being “Hollywood for ugly people” seems truer now than ever. But, of course, this phenomenon isn’t exclusive to Washington. Just as minor league baseball teams sometimes attract their own groupies (see Bull Durham), state capitals have their own version of this story.

It may be too late to reel this in, but what really needs to happen is for we the people to stop thinking of politics as romantic and to stop treating politicians like rock stars, and, instead, to start thinking of them as public servants. But the inherent problem is that people aren’t drafted for office, nor do they “stand” for office, as they do in the UK. No, modern American politicians must “run” for office. And what kind of person typically does that?The comedian Adam Carolla has this bit about how we should weed out would-be molesters from serving as Boy Scout leaders. Anyone who volunteers to go on a camping trip, Carolla advises, should be automatically ruled out. Meanwhile, the dad who begs off, saying he “can’t go this weekend because the Redskins are playing the Cowboys” is forcibly pressed into service. Maybe this is a good model for politics? Anyone who wants to run for office should, automatically, be disqualified from holding it. \xa0To be fair, I wasn’t always so down on charismatic pols. The stupidest (and most un-conservative) column I ever authored was probably one that urged voters to give in to their inner rebel and vote for an exciting candidate. “Something tells me we are heading into a time when conservatives will be willing to jump in the proverbial convertible and head to Vegas on a whim. Hey, Newt's driving,” I wrote.Today, that looks eerily prophetic. After a couple years of Trumpian chaos with the top down, I have completely changed my mind about this sort of relationship. Americans should quit chasing the “bad boy” and settle down with a nice, boring, president who drives a minivan. In other words, “A return to normalcy.” \xa0"},
 {'title': 'Exclusive: FBI Investigated Former CIA Chief Michael Hayden in Secret-Spilling Case',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The FBI sought a search warrant for the email account of former CIA and NSA chief Gen. Michael Hayden in 2012, according to a newly unsealed court filing. The warrant application was part of a broader Obama-era investigation into a leak of classified information to the press. Another official later pleaded guilty in connection to the disclosure.The targeting of Hayden’s AOL email account drives home just how aggressively the Obama administration pursued leaks, in this case following a relatively thin lead all the way to the private email account of a retired four-star general. Hayden served as director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005, and later led the CIA until his retirement in 2009.Asked over email if he’d previously known about the search warrant, Hayden wrote, “I don’t think they announce them,” and added a smiley face emoji.Hayden has emerged in recent years as a fierce critic of the Trump presidency. But before that, he was best known for his aggressive approach to operationalizing the intelligence agencies he ran. After the 9/11 attacks, he helped initiate the NSA’s sweeping warrantless wiretapping program, which was eventually shuttered after widespread criticism by advocacy groups and lawmakers. At the CIA, he contributed to the dramatic increase in the use of drones to hunt and kill suspected terrorists. The search warrant application filed in November 2012, unsealed Monday, shows the bureau suspected Hayden of being a source for a June 1, 2012, New York Times article about the Stuxnet computer virus, a groundbreaking piece of nation-state malware crafted to sabotage one element of Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. The virus targeted equipment at Iran’s uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. The article, written by reporter David Sanger, confirmed suspicions that the U.S. was partly responsible for the attack, which the story said was part of a top secret American-Israeli program called Olympic Games. “Asked over email if he’d previously known about the search warrant, Hayden wrote, ‘I don’t think they announce them,’ and added a smiley face emoji.”Hayden was not cited as a source on the Olympic Games revelation in the Times article, but was quoted on the apparent significance of the Stuxnet virus, which was widely known.\xa0“This is the first attack of a major nature in which a cyberattack was used to effect physical destruction,” Hayden said in part.The 2012 application doesn’t state whether the warrant was granted, but nearly all are. Hayden’s name and email address are redacted from the unsealed filing, but the case is captioned with Hayden’s AOL email address (PDF). Hayden did not immediately respond to inquiries for this story.The search warrant affidavit was filed by special agent Craig Moringiello in the FBI’s counterintelligence division. It shows that the FBI first obtained transaction records for Hayden’s AOL email account. Those showed that he’d exchanged email messages with Sanger 10 times in the months before and after the story. The bureau then used that as evidence in a Nov. 15, 2012, application to obtain the entire contents of Hayden’s AOL account.The FBI found no evidence that Hayden did anything wrong. But using similar tactics, the FBI eventually tracked the story to retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright. In 2016 Cartwright acknowledged he was a source for the article and pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to the FBI. Cartwright’s prosecution was widely criticized by freedom-of-the-press groups and government insiders, and Obama pardoned Cartwright shortly before leaving office.'},
 {'title': 'John Bolton: Syria Is a ‘Sideshow’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Trump appears to be gearing up to bomb Syria, but his new national security adviser has said he believes Syria to be something of a “sideshow.”It’s only John Bolton’s first week on the job as Trump’s national security adviser and all eyes are on him for clues about how the administration will respond to the apparent chemical weapons attack in Syria. So far, there have been just a few tea leaves to read in his 48-hour tenure in the White House. But before that Bolton left a slew of op-eds and Fox News appearances offering some clues to his views on the war there.The picture that emerges from his commentary is of a hawk who accepts much of the conservative catechism on Syria but hasn’t great enthusiasm for it.“I believe since the Syrian civil war broke out nearly seven years ago that the subject of Syria is, sadly, tragic though it might be, is a sideshow in terms of the bigger strategic picture in the Middle East,” Bolton said on Fox in February, using his preferred epithet for the conflict. “The subject of Syria is, sadly, tragic though it might be, is a sideshow in terms of the bigger strategic picture in the Middle East.”— John BoltonWhile many of his ideological fellow travelers have argued that Assad is the primary problem causing Syria’s many conflicts, Bolton instead posited that the dictator of Damascus was at best a tertiary concern, ranking him “a distant third” behind Iran and ISIS in terms threats to the region. “If you want to know where to go to at least resolve the bulk of the problems we face,” he told Fox’s Martha MacCallum, “it’s not getting rid of Assad in Syria. It’s getting rid of the ayatollahs in Tehran.” The Trump administration hasn’t made regime change in Iran its policy, but Bolton’s hawkish views toward Tehran are likely to find a receptive audience with the president, particularly around the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has labeled the agreement the “worst deal ever” and Bolton’s argument to undo it may have already won the day before the newly appointed national security adviser stepped into the White House. While James Mattis supports the Iran deal, the defense secretary, long considered an Iran hawk, may find common cause with Bolton over the shared goal of rolling back Iranian influence in the Middle East.Bolton supported the last round of strikes on Syria and seems inclined to do so again, but his Syria commentary paints a picture of a man who comes to the White House with a preference to focus on regime change in Tehran rather than deal with the thorny problems in Damascus. One of Bolton’s lengthiest discussions of Syria policy came in a 2012 National Review piece where he declared that “regime change in Syria is prima facie in America’s interest as well as the interests of Israel and our Arab friends in the region.” Still, even at that early stage in the civil war, Bolton was already showing signs of hesitancy, cautioning that the possibility of Assad’s removal was now “much more remote.” The optimal time for regime change, in his view, had been shortly after the invasion of Iraq, when the U.S. had more forces built up nearby and Assad’s allies had fewer. By 2012, Bolton had already lost confidence that there was a sufficiently sized rebel force free of the influence of al Qaeda or other jihadist groups that could bring about a post-Assad Syria to America’s liking. As others called for urgent support to the opposition, he was more circumspect, saying the U.S. should hold off until it could be assured regime change would happen “when—and only when—it becomes feasible on our terms.”Since then, the Islamist groups that made Bolton so wary in 2012 have grown in influence and Bolton’s comfort with Syria’s opposition as a tool of U.S. foreign policy has waned further. “I think we need more Arab forces from the Gulf states, from Egypt, from Jordan, and less reliance on some of the dubious Syrian groups,” he told the Journal Editorial Report in 2017.So what would Bolton do about the apparent chemical attack in Douma? He did support strikes by the Trump administration under similar circumstances in the wake of the Assad regime’s nerve agent attack on Khan Sheikhoun.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The day before the Trump administration launched a cruise missile attack on Shayrat Air Base in Syria, Bolton called on Trump to “eliminate Syria’s Air Force” and “tell the Russians to clear out of that airbase so they don’t become Assad’s Air Force” After the strikes, he high-fived Trump and called the strikes “very measured, very precise, had a very limited rationale because of the use of chemical weapons, but very effective.” But as he noted, support for striking Syria after it violated a president’s red line on chemical weapons represented “a shift” toward a policy “I haven’t favored that before.” In 2013, when Obama asked Congress for authority for the use of force following Syria’s use of chemical weapons, Bolton wrote that “on policy grounds that Obama is wrong to use force in Syria.”Beyond a strike in response to violations of Trump’s stated chemical weapons red lines, it’s not clear that Bolton is eager to dwell on Syria policy. To him, Syria is not so much a humanitarian problem to be approached on its own terms but a broader problem about the growth of Iranian and Russian influence in the Middle East better addressed by confrontation elsewhere.The zeal for confrontation with Iran, however, may not go down well in the Defense Department, where commanders are trying to clean up the remnants of ISIS while maintaining a tense standoff against Russian, Iranian, and Assad regime forces. “He’ll soon find out that the U.S. has 12,000 troops that could be targeted if he gets too cute, and that a side fight with Iranian militias isn’t exactly something the Pentagon wants to take on at this moment in time,” says Aaron Stein, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East.Bolton’s sentiment of Syria-as-sideshow, oddly enough, has some echoes to President Obama’s approach to the conflict. Obama, too, viewed Syria as nettlesome distraction in his attempts to pivot toward other strategic priorities he viewed as more pressing. But Syria has an annoying habit of intruding on how statesmen, Republican or Democratic, would otherwise prefer to spend their time. And Obama ended up sending troops to the country and weapons to its rebels, much to his evident unease. So far it’s been easy for Bolton to dismiss Syria’s relevance from the comfort of a pundit’s chair and punt on questions about policy by substituting his hawkish policy preferences for Iran. Punting from a perch in the White House, as the day-to-day dilemmas of American policy in Syria pile up, will likely prove much harder."},
 {'title': 'Judicial Elections Are a Mess—Here’s How to Fix the Problem',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Tuesday evening, progressives were celebrating the results for the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. And for good reason: a 56 percent to 44 percent win for a liberal candidate, Rebecca Dallet, in a state that Trump had won is a big deal. But the event itself is nothing to celebrate. Judicial elections—and especially non-partisan judicial elections—are bad for law and democracy.\xa0\xa0About 90 percent of state judges face some kind of election. States turned to judicial elections with the best intentions in the 19th\xa0century. As I explained in my book The People’s Courts, Americans had witnessed\xa0the problems with partisan judicial appointments to relatively short terms. Judges had remained captured by party bosses and politicians, and they were unwilling to stand up to the abuses by the political branches. American reformers thought the elections would promote judicial independence by insulating judges from partisanship. Their naivete is on display throughout American today.Instead of judges beholden to the inside politics of appointment and reappointment, they are now beholden to special interests, campaign financiers, and the manipulations of negative advertising. Competitive state supreme court races usually cost many millions of dollars, often raised from parties with pending cases or interest groups with something at stake in those cases. And many states have partisan elections, which makes those judges reliant on partisan support.Reformers have tried to address this problem by adopting non-partisan election systems. For example, Wisconsin has multiple judicial candidates run in a non-partisan open primary to select two candidates for a general election with no party labels. These efforts have also backfired. \xa0One of the main problems with judicial elections is that voters do not know enough about the candidates to make a meaningful choice. But as long as voters already have so little information, removing the party identification from the ballot gives voters even less information. A “D” or an “R” by a name might not very helpful, but party labels do give us at least a good hint about the candidates’ leanings on major questions. If you take that hint away, it turns out that voters depend on worse signals: first and last names as a hint about sex, race, and ethnicity. Voters choose names that are familiar, not foreign. They sometimes pick judges who happen to have the same names as celebrities and sports heroes.These type of non-partisan reforms also backfire by forcing candidates to replace the party ID signal with even more advertising, and even nastier campaigns, funded by even more special interest money. If they can’t reply on the party label hint, they choose to try to destroy their opponents’ reputations.Wisconsin has become one of the worst examples. It was once a state with relatively civil elections. But over the past decade, its judicial elections have become infamously nasty. Wisconsin’s first black justice, Louis Butler, ruled against lead paint manufacturers, and then he was targeted by business interest groups. In 2008, his challenger, Michael Gableman, who had almost no appellate experience, ran a race-baiting Willie Horton-style ad campaign that grossly distorted Butler’s record, blaming him for a rape to which he had zero connection. The ad put Butler’s face side-by-side with the face of Mitchell, the black man who had been convicted of rape. A narrator says,\xa0“Butler found a loophole. Mitchell went on to molest another child.” The ad implies that Butler as a judge put Mitchell back on the street. In fact, Butler was a public defender representing Mitchell on appeal. A lower court agreed with Butler’s constitutional argument, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned that decision, anad Mitchell served his full sentence. Three years after his release, Mitchell committed another crime, not connected with Butler’s work at all. Gableman won. Three years later, groups on the left attacked Judge David Prosser during his re-election campaign, distorting his record as a prosecutor for not bringing charges against a priest accused of child abuse. Prosser nevertheless won, but soon thereafter, he was accused of putting his hands around the neck of his colleague Judge Ann Bradley. These nasty races may have been a factor in the collapse of civility on Wisconsin’s state bench.What are the solutions? Old-school appointments by governors are no panacea. But there is a fix that many states have turned to that has shown promise: a merit system for nominating judges. Merit commissions generally\xa0are composed of leaders of the state bar, representatives of the legislature, appointees by the governor, and often a chief judge or retired judge. They select three names, from which the governor nominates one, pending state senate confirmation. After a few years on the bench, they face a yes-or-no retention election.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.This system is also not perfect. It doesn’t yield the most “meritorious” candidates, nor the most diverse slate of candidates, but it tends to weed out the cronies and the ideologues. Moreover, retention elections tend to be much less expensive than the competitive systems. Special interests seem to be eager to spend on a hand-picked candidate, but they’re less willing to spend if they are only able to remove a judge, who will be replaced by the same merit system that had picked him or her. Incumbents overwhelmingly win these retention elections, which helps promote job security and thus judicial independence. Maybe merit re-appointment would be better than any kind of election, but these retention elections are an acceptable compromise with those who seek some degree of public accountability. Should Democrats be happy about the specific result in Wisconsin? Sure. But the more general results of judicial elections are judges less willing to protect minorities, criminal defendants, consumers, and the public interest, and more beholden to party politics and special interests. Judicial elections sound like more democracy, but judges need to be independent from elections and party politics if they are supposed to protect the rules of elections and democracy from partisan manipulation and abuse. If you care about constitutional democracy, don’t just help get your judicial candidate elected. Help end partisan and non-partisan judicial elections.Jed Shugerman is a law professor at Fordham, the author of The People’s Courts (Harvard U.

 {'title': 'Get Angry Now to Make Congress Protect Mueller—Or Later, After Trump Fires Him',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "There are signs the political system is creakily moving into gear to protect the investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Will the moves be fast enough? The integrity of our democracy might depend on the answer. Congress could act to protect special counsel Robert Muller and make it far harder for a panicked president to fire him. Mueller, too, appears to be taking steps to protect the investigation even if Trump swings the axe. Justice Department leadership could find ways to block or at least delay his firing. Ultimately, though, only a howl of public outrage would be enough to protect the investigation. Plainly, President Trump is one explosive tweet away from triggering a constitutional crisis. The president used the somber occasion of a meeting with military leaders to discuss a possible attack on Syria to call the FBI raid on Michael Cohen’s home and office an “attack on our country.” “Many people,” he said, have urged him to fire Mueller. Trump actually gave the order once already, in June of last year, only to be blocked when his White House counsel refused to carry it out and threatened to quit. The New York Times reports Trump tried again in December. The president seems constrained only by his staff’s lack of eagerness to conspire to obstruct justice.The risks seem to be escalating, with the capital rife with rumors that Trump will fire Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who supervises the independent counsel. If Trump manages to replace him with a pliant apparatchik, it will be that much easier to act.Lawmakers appear at last to be taking seriously this threat to the rule of law. On Wednesday, Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Thom Tillis joined with Democrats Cory Booker and Chris Coons to propose a new measure to protect Mueller (previously they had dueling plans). It would delay any firing of the special counsel for ten days. Mueller could appeal to a three-judge panel for reinstatement during that time. Senate Judiciary Committee chair Charles Grassley announced he would add the bill to the panel’s calendar. A vote will likely come this month.Grassley’s move marks a significant break with the White House, one of the most important yet by any Republican lawmaker. It would likely pass the committee, and if it came to the Senate floor, it may initially garner majority support. But timing matters. The Senate is built to move … slowly. Any filibuster would require 60 votes to break. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—last seen flashing a thumbs-up with the president in a meeting at the White House—has said he did not see the need for such a step. Still, it would be an ugly spectacle. Senators would debate, and be forced to vote, in the glare of public attention.Even with Senate support, the bill would be far from becoming law. There’s the House of Representatives, of course. House leaders usually have an iron grip on what measures come to the floor. Speaker Paul Ryan has murmured support for Mueller, but said he saw no need for a law. Will the lame duck speaker show sudden independence? Far more likely, the feral competition to succeed him will push party leaders to outdo each other in backing Trump. Democrats could try to force a vote with a “discharge petition,” requiring signatures from a majority of House members. Those hardly ever succeed, but would put vulnerable Republicans on the spot, further imperiling the party’s majority. The president would surely veto such a measure. Congress could override the veto, but that would take a two-thirds majority in both houses. Since 1952, a Congress controlled by the president’s party has overridden a veto only twice, both times under Jimmy Carter. After all that, a new law would likely face a court test, though probably only if it were triggered by a firing. In the past, the Supreme Court found the previous independent counsel statute, now expired, to be constitutional. Two of three law professors who testified before the Senate in September said the plan would pass muster. But Antonin Scalia’s famous dissent in Morrison v. Olson, warning of the dangers of independent prosecutors gone rogue, has earned growing support among judges.And the whole process could be short-circuited if Mueller gets fired first. What then? Mueller appears to be preparing for such an outcome, taking pains to share the job of investigating with as wide a group of prosecutors as possible. Court filings show that Rosenstein has approved steps including the indictment of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. The raid on Michael Cohen’s office happened after Mueller referred the matter to his supervisor, who sent it to the famously independent U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan. There’s reason to believe that underlying evidence is being shared within the Justice Department as well. Alan Dershowitz, the former Harvard Law professor who defends Trump on television and recently dined with him, went on Sean Hannity’s Fox show and attacked Mueller for “laundering information to another prosecutorial authority” and called the steps “subterfuge.” That may be the first time a prosecutor was attacked for not going rogue.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Kenneth Starr brought no charges against President Bill Clinton when he was tasked with investigating the Whitewater real estate deal. But he wrongly grabbed at the chance to expand his own jurisdiction to investigate Clinton’s personal scandal. A year of crisis followed, with impeachment by the House, acquittal by the Senate, and Clinton’s approval rating soaring.\xa0If Trump orders Rosenstein and Sessions to fire Mueller, they could greatly complicate his plans by refusing. Trump could fire them, but that might then block his ability to slip another official into place who would do the job. Legal experts disagree about what would happen next. Other Justice Department\xa0officials could balk as well. Trump could find himself with nobody in “Main Justice” willing to do the deed. The one thing that would make the biggest difference is public outrage. Richard Nixon thought he could get away with the Saturday Night Massacre until tens of thousands of telegrams helped force him to appoint a new prosecutor and release his damning tapes. Will Americans flood the streets to protest if the president finds a way to fire Mueller? The president’s view of himself is refracted through the press. And nonstop coverage of demonstrators in the street may be just what is needed to weaken his resolve and force him to reconsider his own self-sabotage.Michael Waldman is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.

 {'title': 'The Roy Cohn I Knew Was a Small, Sad Man',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Donald Trump has often said he needs someone like the late Roy Cohn to represent him today. As Frank Rich writes, it was Cohn who taught Trump to “counterpunch viciously, deny everything, stiff your creditors, manipulate the tabloids.” I saw firsthand his disregard for the rule of law, and propensity to lie with a straight face in the ’70s and ’80s while doing research on the trial of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg for what became a book I wrote with the late Joyce Milton, The Rosenberg File. I had begun the project as an article with journalist Sol Stern. In 1978, we went to see Cohn—who had first come to attention in his early twenties while serving as one of the Rosenbergs’ prosecutors—in the East Side Manhattan townhouse that served as both his office and his home. When we walked into the waiting area, we found members of the Gambino crime family and their bodyguards waiting to see him. We expected that since they were there before us and had already been waiting for some time to go over legal issues with Cohn, we would have quite a lengthy wait.When Cohn emerged, the Gambino group got up from their seats, ready to go into Cohn’s office. Cohn, however, motioned with his hands that they should sit down. Pointing to Stern and me, Cohn said: “These gentlemen are from The New York Times, and that is very important. You’ll have to wait. The press comes first.”When we sat down, Cohn immediately bragged to us that “even if I had decided to be a defense attorney for the Rosenbergs, they would not have been able to get off.” He added: “Not that I ever would have thought to defend them. I’ll defend the mob any day. They’re good Americans.”Behind him was a menagerie of stuffed animals, and walls lined with photos of him with J. Edgar Hoover and Sen. Joseph McCarthy, who had chosen the 24-year-old lawyer—fresh from his Rosenberg trial win—to join the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and his crusade against Communists, real and imagined.Cohn’s aides were all young, gay men. As Roger Stone later recalled, Cohn believed “Gays were weak, effeminate. He always seemed to have these young blond boys around. It just wasn’t discussed.” Cohn, who eventually died of AIDS while insisting he had liver cancer, was a fierce opponent of gay rights who regularly engaged in vicious gay-baiting and himself used every derogatory term when speaking of gay men.When we began our interview with Cohn, he presented himself as he often did, as the lead attorney for the Rosenberg prosecution. That was not true. The senior prosecutor was Southern District U.S. Attorney Irving Saypol, who Time called “the nation’s Number One legal hunter of top Communists.” Saypol, though, had his own “proclivities for publicity,” as the FBI put it, so was willing to let the young Cohn talk up his role since the boss knew his assistant U.S. attorney moved in café society circles and was friendly with gossip columnist Leonard Lyons.Cohn’s conduct during the Rosenberg trial was, if not illegal, highly unethical. The FBI believed he had engaged in ex parte communication with the trial judge to make clear he favored capital sentences for both Rosenbergs and co-defendant Morton Sobell. Cohn, who often pointed to FBI reports released about the case as proof of espionage activity by Rosenberg and his accomplices, called the bureau’s reports about his own unethical acts “hearsay” and “unsupported speculation.”And while the judge had also talked to other attorneys, Cohn wanted it to be known that, while he didn’t do it, he also wanted credit for the thing he says he didn’t do. “I… was the only one,” he told us, “who could theoretically have had such [ex parte] contact.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.This is the episode that playwright Tony Kushner refers to in the play Angels in America when he has his Cohn character say:\xa0“Was it legal? Fuck legal. Am I a nice man. Fuck nice… You want to be nice, or do you want to be effective?” In 1983, The Rosenberg File was published and I was sent on a book tour. Much to my surprise, at least the first couple times, I walked into several radio and TV studios to find Roy Cohn there, waiting to offer his take on our book.Cohn was adamant that we got one thing wrong. Our book described how Julius Rosenberg had put together a major spy network for Soviet intelligence, one that was successful in giving the Soviets top-level military secrets, as well as whatever they could get regarding the Manhattan Project from Ethel’s brother, David Greenglass. Ethel, as has been shown since then, fully knew of her husband’s activity as a spy, and had recommended to her sister-in-law Ruth Greenglass that she urge her husband David to become a spy. Ethel had also recommended potential recruits to Julius’ Soviet handler and was present when material gathered by Julius’ ring was prepared for transmission to the Soviets. Although guilty of “conspiracy to commit espionage,” she was a peripheral figure, who was indicted in the hope that her arrest would serve as a lever that might pressure Julius to confess. Cohn did not see it that way. He insisted, disregarding evidence entirely, that the whole Rosenberg spy operation was put together and run by Ethel Rosenberg. “There is simply no evidence for that,” I would respond. Cohn’s retort: “I sat in that courtroom every day and looked at Ethel’s eyes. Looking at her, it was more than clear that she alone was the ringleader, who led Julius around by a leash.” Cohn would repeat this at every appearance I had with him, as if the facts and evidence were totally irrelevant. Perhaps he needed to say that to assuage his conscience, since he was adamant in his recommendation to Judge Kaufman that she too be given a death sentence. Repeating a blatant lie, evidently, was sufficient for Cohn to believe the public would see it his way and that the way he saw it was at least in some significant sense the truth. Finally, at one such radio interview in New York City, Cohn came into the studio in a state of despair. “What’s bothering you, Roy?” I asked. Cohn referred to the large glass stands at New York City bus stops, which at the time were plastered on the outside with full size photos of famous people present and past. That week, one of them was Roy Cohn, who told me that “I’ve just come from standing at a shelter with my photo for five hours, and not one person recognized me or came up to say anything.” "},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump Takes Out Paul Ryan, and ‘It’s Going to Be a Civil War’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The news that Paul Ryan is retiring from Congress was received by grim-faced members of the GOP caucus finally realizing what they’ve done, and what’s coming. Ryan pulled the ripcord Wednesday after a 19-year career in Congress, declaring he would leave Washington at the end of his current term to spend more time with his existential angst over what he let Donald Trump do to our country.The happy talk about holding the House is over. The spin for the press, the rubes, and the donor class just came to a shrieking halt. Nancy Pelosi is in her crone cavern, cackling with glee, knowing that the Democrats are now in play in almost 80 congressional seats. The general of the House Republican army just announced he’s leaving the field just as the tide of political war looks most grim.Ryan and his caucus hoped to run on the tax cut, the economy, and infrastructure. All of these messages now will be swept aside. Ryan owns his share of the blame; too often, he behaved as if he was some deferential junior VP at a Trump resort and not the leader of the House of Representatives in a co-equal branch of government. The idea, popular among the House leadership, that a diet of ass-kissing and deference would make Trump into a normal president who didn’t need the political equivalent of Depends was always a strategic mistake. Ryan is now paying the price. The rest of his caucus will pay in the fall.The election season will now feature a Republican leadership fight with all the reality-TV tropes we’ve come to expect in this vulgar, stupid age, as it inevitably devolves into a shabby bidding war over who will be more amenable and obedient to Donald Trump. The purity tests from Fox News, the screeching teenagers in the Donnie Trump Tiger Beat Breitbart Fan Club, and Trump himself will ensure this contest—like every damn thing in America today—is All About Him. Ryan’s unfulfilled agenda, including entitlement reform, is now a dead letter, along with the hopes so many in the conservative movement had reposed in him. The Kochs and dozens of other free-market folks were invested in Paul Ryan’s future. Those investments were squandered like Granny’s Social Security check at the Trump Taj Mahal. Regardless of who succeeds Ryan, the agenda of limited-government conservatism based on fiscal probity, personal responsibility, free trade, and limited government is as dead as Donald Trump’s marriage. A top Ryan aide texted me this morning: “It’s going to be a civil war. No one knows how bad this will get. Kevin [McCarthy] is such a fucking moron he’s going to get rolled by Pelosi every day. FML.” Another Ryan insider echoed the “civil war” sentiment, and noted that Ryan’s decision will set off still another wave of Republican retirements. This week marked the final surrender of the GOP on the central economic issues of our time: the debt and entitlement reform. Did our talk ever truly match our walk when it came to the economy? Not as often as I’d like, and I’m sure Ryan feels the same. Still, he was a fluent translator of Conservative to English, a bridge between Hayek and hope. He lacked the needy edge and insecurities so evident in this president and so beloved of the new GOP. Ryan had been the endpoint of a conservative philosophical movement that combined Jack Kemp’s optimism about growth, opportunity, economic freedom, and the value of work with a profound understanding of the painful need to reform how the federal government operates. Kiss that goodbye. Trump’s economic message is profoundly, inalterably negative, defensive, small, and bitter. It’s about how stupid Americans are, and how the wily Chinese and murderous Mexicans are stealing from us, tricking us, and robbing us blind. His base is conditioned to having their fear centers endlessly stimulated by his constant drip of apocalyptic, conspiratorial rhetoric and fed hazy promises of the creation of walls, the smiting of the Asians, the launching of trade wars, and the kicking of asses.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The collapse of the economic leg of the GOP’s coalition is complete. We’re now the party of Credit Card Don, the King of Debt. Our base worships a man whose own Bhagavad Gita reads: “Now I become Debt, destroyer of Republicans.”The trillions in new spending, the blowout tax bill’s monstrous costs, and Trump’s moron-grade nationalism and state capitalism mean the ideal of making government smaller, smarter, and better is over. It was one thing to talk about dynamic scoring and positive job growth based on the tax cut. It was quite another to predict levels of growth approaching asymptotic.The grunting, pig-ignorant Trumpentariat types are doing their usual ranting street-preacher genius analysis of the situation, declaring you’ve triggered duh libs and now Ryan will be replaced with a speaker who, as the Trump Constitution clearly states, will behave with properly knee-padded deference to President for Life Kim Jong Don. They see this as the greatest possible loss for the hated establishment, a draining of the swamp. Those poor, dumb bastards. First, Ryan’s departure just pulled the plug on the most powerful and successful legislative fundraising machine the Republican Party has ever known. For all the bitching from the Purity Posse crew about Ryan and the lobbyists, they sure were happy when he was passing money to them through the NRCC or his own campaign committee. To quote the great Chuck Yeager, “No bucks, no Buck Rogers.”Donald Trump won’t save his party’s House majority. In fact, the more he becomes the center of the discussion for the members still running in 2018, the worse the ground looks for the GOP. All that’s left is hope that the Democratic Party’s notoriously terrible campaign operation can find a way to screw up the gift they’ve been given.The rubes still think Trumpism sells. It doesn’t, outside of the deepest deep-red seats. They seem to honestly believe that in the 25 swing seats where Donald Trump is as well-liked as a case of genital herpes that muh wall and MS-13 TV ads are going to save the majority. They still think that races are won with MAGA hats and badly photoshopped Hillary Pizzagate memes. They conflate Trump’s Russian-supported, celebrity-driven win against the luckless, joyless Hillary with actual campaigning. History repeats, first as tragedy, then as Trump. This is the Watergate pattern writ large. In 1973, Republicans were screaming that the investigation was nothing but a Fake New Witch Hunt. They lost 49 House seats and eight Senate seats in 1974, two months after Nixon resigned. Everything Trump touches dies, and Paul Ryan’s legacy is no exception."},
 {'title': 'The Joke’s on the White House Correspondents’ Dinner',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As I write this Monday afternoon, we’re in the third phase of chest-beating over a comedian playing blue at Saturday evening’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner. It’s an annual affair, both the dinner and the criticism, but this year we’re cycling through phases of post-partum regret faster than ever before, from “it’s all in the spirit of fun” to “don’t take yourself so seriously” to “it’s time to get a musical guest, or a juggler, or maybe a mime.” To recap, Daily Show regular Michelle Wolf is taking heat for crossing an invisible line of acceptable criticism of the powers that be, especially those powers sitting a few feet away. There were the usual jokes about Trump who for the second year chose to be with the people in the heartland rather than speak, as most presidents do, at the dinner. In his place was Sarah Huckabee Sanders. There’s no doubt Sanders lies and does so robotically without the decency to reveal a flicker of regret the way predecessor Sean Spicer did.Still there’s Sanders in her nice blue dress, having agreed to fill in the significant gap left by the president’s absence, absorbing incoming with a stiff upper lip, or smokey eye as Wolf would have it. It’s fair to ask whether going beyond the maddening way Sanders does her job to comment on her makeup, her similarity to the ugliest character in The Handmaid’s Tale, and playing the Uncle Tom card makes a point against her, or the press countenancing it.We want the president, or at least his stand-in, to drink our wine, eat our rare filet, laugh at the human condition, and leave understanding the roles each branch plays. That \xa0outcome may be one reason there was no skit entitled Stormy Weather at \xa0this year's Gridiron which the president and First Lady attended. The same principle works for the WHCD: We want Sanders to stop lying. We don’t want to humiliate her and have her go away hurt. In fairness to Wolf, she\xa0was only doing as others have: acting as our surrogate to tweak people in power to the point of debasing them—for being in charge, for treating us like children, for withholding the truth. It’s inevitable that every so often a performer will cross an invisible line. When it happens, it’s inevitable that the organization will feign surprise. It’s also inevitable that the outrage will blow over. The dinner creates an elite problem over an elite affair that will be forgotten before the press starts competing for next year’s celebrity guests.But this time, there’s no room for error. Wolf was mild compared to Don Imus’ infamous screed shaming then-president Bill Clinton for, in the radio talker’s telling, having sex on astroturf in the back of his pickup truck with Hillary looking on. But the ground under the press has shifted since 1996, so that Wolf’s screed played into Trump’s already ferocious battle against the enemy of the people in which he attacks the foundations of democracy from the courts to the FBI to the independent press. Until now, the president has had virtually no evidence to back up his allegations but he’s glomming on big time to the “bust” of a dinner as\xa0Exhibit A. And it could play to a wider group than just his base coming as it does with video of the press hobnobbing with those it’s supposed to cover in the depths of the swamp, in formal dress, painful footwear, and sweaty ambition. It’s a sign of the time that this year’s guest of note was Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti. Trump described the evening as an “embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy ‘comedian’ totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest, or start over!”For once, he has a point. The retort that Wolf was no worse than Trump, an excuse so overused kids employ it to justify not doing their homework, is lame. He goes low so we go low? And there’s no percentage in doing it. Ask Marco Rubio and Jim Comey how fruitful it is to stoop to Trump’s level. Because Trump introduced the p-word into politics doesn’t mean it should be uttered from the podium of the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. Trade associations have raucous conventions all the time but the press is\xa0a constitutionally protected institution that needs to guard its position, not expose it to misinterpretation. As it became obvious she was bombing, Wolf muttered an aside aimed at the\xa0WHCA saying, “Shoulda done more\xa0research\xa0before you got me to do this.”\xa0But not vice versa. Bombing in\xa0Washington will likely boost Wolf's career.\xa0After Imus,\xa0the correspondents’ association wrote a formal letter of apology to the president and Clinton’s press secretary unsuccessfully pleaded with C-Span not to rebroadcast the dinner.That hasn’t happened yet here. Association president Margaret Talev, who gave a fine speech about a free press, defended Wolf as a talented comedian with a message to deliver while also lamenting that “the entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of the mission” of a free press.

That’s not so, but why offer up ammunition? Talev’s explanation didn’t stop talk of overhauling the event, and allaying criticism that it’s an excuse for the press to celebrate ourselves and get high-ranking officials and Hollywood stars (the cast of Downton Abbey and Veep have come) to join us for a night on the town. The arms race to bribe celebrities with Oscar-like goodie bags, suites at the Four Seasons, and first-class flights has abated a bit since Trump boycotted the dinner and word traveled that the dinner was not that hot. George Clooney said he was surprised when his car pulled up to the Washington Hilton and not the White House. To compensate, in recent years, there’s more stage time given to the awarding of journalism scholarships. It’s hardly enough. That $100,000 is dwarfed by the millions media companies spend on a night that politicians see mostly as an obligation, celebrities mostly as a disappointment.\xa0The press sees it as something to apologize for. This president just isn’t into it, except as something to use against the press. On the night Washington was in black-tie for Wolf’s lame routine, nine reporters were killed by a suicide bomb in Kabul. That’s who we need to honor. Talev admitted the evening’s performer didn’t support the mission of the press. Next year, the group needs to choose one that will, or call the whole thing off."},
 {'title': 'The 9th Circuit Keeps Saying ‘No’ to Trump. No Wonder He’s Racing to Reshape It in His Image.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Racing to remake the federal court in a way that pleases his conservative base, President Trump has confirmed 21 circuit judges, a big number. And there’s nowhere has Trump been more intent on reshaping the bench than in the famously liberal Ninth Circuit, headquartered in San Francisco, whose judges he has taunted on Twitter, and who have blocked both his travel ban and his effort to withhold federal money from so-called sanctuary cities. There are eight vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, counting one announced retirement effective in August, and court watchers say it’s telling that the White House has already teed up a nominee for a seat that isn’t yet available, prioritizing it over existing vacancies on other circuits. There are 22 judges currently riding the Ninth Circuit. Add eight young, socially conservative judges vetted by the Federalist Society into lifetime seats and Trump will have bolstered the ideological makeup of the Ninth Circuit by a third, potentially shifting a raft of rulings important to cultural conservatives and to corporate America. \xa0It’s rare when one party has such a glide path to putting its imprint on any circuit, let alone the nation’s third-largest one. Republicans need just 50 votes in the Senate to confirm Trump’s picks, and there’s every reason to assume that all his \xa0nominees will be confirmed — changing the nature of a Circuit that has long been an irritant to special interests aligned with Republicans and conservatives and large corporations, says Dan Goldberg, legal director with the liberal Alliance for Justice. “It’s a strong pro-environmental circuit, so you’re seeing corporations wanting to eliminate protections for public lands and get more mining rights. They’ve spent the last 30 years attacking judges for enforcing environmental laws.” \xa0Ryan Bounds, a 44-year-old federal prosecutor in Oregon, epitomizes both the type of person Trump seeks to install together and the precedent-shattering steps Republicans are taking to get him installed. Bounds withheld from the Oregon Judicial Commission and from the Senate Judiciary committee writings that he did as a student at Stanford in the 1990’s where he “used incredibly demeaning terms to discuss multiculturalism. LGBT rights, diversity and survivors of sexual assault,” says Goldberg. At his confirmation hearing on May 9th, Bounds apologized for the tone of his writings for the Stanford Review, but not for the substance. He had said that diversity policies at Stanford “aggravated” intolerance more than “many a Nazi book burning,” that multi-cultural organizations “divide up by race for their feel-good ethnic hoedowns,” and that expelling students is probably not going to contribute to a rape victim’s recovery. Past their concerns about whether Bounds can apply the law fairly to people he expresses such contempt for, Democrats are rankled by how Republican Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley tossed aside a hundred years of senate tradition to grant Bounds a hearing when neither of his home-state senators returned what’s known as a blue slip to signal their approval of his nomination. \xa0According to the Congressional Research Service, it is the first time that a nomination has ever proceeded without a blue slip from at least one home-state senator. When President Obama was in the White House, Grassley was meticulous about denying a hearing to any Obama nominee that didn’t have the support of both home-state senators, creating the backlog of vacancies that Trump is now rushing to fill. Trump calls the vacancies a “gift” from Obama, claiming falsely that his predecessor’s complacency created the backlog, rather than GOP obstruction.

Feinstein said in a statement they were negotiating in good faith trying to find consensus picks, and that they expect Grassley will support their efforts. “It will be a big test, whether the White House negotiations go forth or it’s another Pennsylvania and Oregon,” says Goldberg. The White House stiffed the Oregon senators, and in Pennsylvania, after Democrat Bob Casey signed off on a consensus name, the White House chose the one person Casey said he could not support for the Third Circuit, David Porter, an attorney closely associated with former senator and conservative presidential candidate Rick Santorum.“There are lots of Republican conservatives out there who would read briefs and apply the law, and that’s not who’s been nominated,” says Goldberg. “They don’t want neutral unbiased judges who respect the facts. They want true believers who will advance an agenda.” "},
 {'title': 'FBI Probes Hack of Elliott Broidy, the Republican Operative at the Center of Scandal After Scandal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The FBI is investigating the hacking of scandal-dogged Republican operative Elliott Broidy, The Daily Beast has learned. Three sources familiar with the investigation said the FBI has questioned multiple witnesses about the hack, which stole thousands of emails and allegedly resulted in scores of stories that embarrassed Broidy and snarled his business dealings. The hack appears to have released a deluge of shocking stories about Broidy.Broidy is a venture capitalist who has long been a key donor and financier of Republican candidates. During the 2016 election, he was vice chair of a joint fundraising arm of the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Trump campaign. He was also formerly a deputy finance chairman of the RNC.And he isn’t new to scandal. In 2009, Broidy pleaded guilty to giving almost $1 million to New York state pension fund officials in exchange for his company receiving $250 million to manage, as Reuters detailed. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and did not serve any time in prison. Years later, he found himself in the headlines again—this time as a result of email leak after email leak detailing his questionable behavior. One Wall Street Journal story—which Broidy’s people believe to be based on stolen emails—showed he agreed to pay $1.6 million in a non-disclosure agreement to Playboy Playmate Shera Bechard who became pregnant while having an affair with him. According to the Journal, the deal barred the Playboy Playmate from revealing she had ever been with Broidy. It was set for her to be paid in quarterly installments over two years. “I acknowledge I had a consensual relationship with a Playboy Playmate... At the end of our relationship, this woman shared with me that she was pregnant...and I offered to help her financially.”— Elliott Broidy“I acknowledge I had a consensual relationship with a Playboy Playmate,” Broidy told the paper. “At the end of our relationship, this woman shared with me that she was pregnant. She alone decided that she did not want to continue with the pregnancy and I offered to help her financially during this difficult period.”The story connects Broidy to another man who is no stranger to scandal, Donald Trump’s longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen. Both men were on the RNC finance committee at the same time, and Cohen reportedly helped set up the deal to pay off the Playmate. The lawyer for the Playmate was Keith Davidson—the same lawyer who helped set up the non-disclosure agreement between porn star Stormy Daniels and then-candidate Donald Trump in the final days of the 2016 campaign. The Wall Street Journal reported that both Trump’s payment to Stormy Daniels and Broidy’s payment to Shera Bechard were made through Michael Cohen’s Essential Consultants LLC. CNBC reported that a Broidy spokesperson told them he believed the story broke because hackers stole communications about the payment and subsequently leaked them to reporters (the Broidy spokesperson later disputed that he made that claim to CNBC). After the story’s publication, Broidy resigned from his post with the RNC.The hacked emails were also central to a recent Associated Press story detailing Broidy’s alleged efforts to lobby the Trump administration on behalf of the Saudis and Emiratis. Broidy worked with an associate named George Nader—who is reportedly a convicted pedophile and\xa0a cooperating witness for the Mueller probe—to push for the two Gulf states’ strategic ends in Washington. In exchange, according to the AP, both men expected generous defense contracts. Nader and Broidy’s work for the Emiratis and Saudis has now been well-documented. A March 21 New York Times story reported that Nader told Broidy he boasted about his work to top leaders in Saudi and the U.A.E., describing Broidy’s work as “the Pivotal Indispensable Magical Role you are playing to help them.” Nader “has been granted immunity in a deal for his cooperation with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to people familiar with the matter,” the Times noted, “and his relationship with Mr. Broidy may also offer clues to the direction of that inquiry.”That story detailed the way Broidy and Nader worked together to try to influence the White House to take stances favorable to the Saudis and Emiratis, and in opposition to the Qataris. Last summer, the Saudis and Emiratis launched a blockade of Qatar over the tiny nation’s alleged support for terrorism. The Saudis are also angry about Qatar’s less-than-hostile relationship with its biggest regional adversary, Iran. In one reported communication, Broidy told Nader that he told Trump that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “was performing poorly and should be relieved, but only at a good time, politically.” (The president later forced Tillerson out of his post.)A spokesperson for Broidy told the Times that they believed the communications between the two men cited in the piece were stolen from Broidy by hackers.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Taken together, these stories have embarrassed Broidy and his business associates—and sent shockwaves through the Republican donor community. (An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. So did a representative for Broidy.)“Broidy is currently suing the state of Qatar over the hacks, alleging he was the victim of ‘a sophisticated electronic warfare, espionage and disinformation campaign.’”Broidy and his allies are currently suing the state of Qatar over the hacks. They allege that Qatari state-backed actors were responsible for hacking him, and described it in a complaint as “a sophisticated electronic warfare, espionage and disinformation campaign.” The suit alleges that the hackers targeted Broidy’s wife with a spearphishing scheme similar to the one that took down Clinton chairman John Podesta’s email account. The state of Qatar denies any culpability in the hack—even as Broidy’s friends have noted the similarity between this email exploitation and the one conducted against Yousef al-Otaiba—the UAE’s powerful ambassador to Washington and a potent diplomatic foe of the Qataris. Broidy says the hacks started in mid-December of 2017 and targeted his allies and associates as well as himself. He singled out Nicholas Muzin, a former senior staffer to Sen. Ted Cruz and lobbyist for Qatar, in his lawsuit. The hacks came in the midst of a lobbying war that pitted Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Qatar. Broidy has done business and worked closely with Saudi and Emirati officials, and is an ardent critic of Qatar. The two gulf states are currently blockading Qatar, citing its alleged support for terrorists as the reason. In an amended complaint of the lawsuit, filed May 24, Broidy alleged that Qatar state actors hired former CIA operatives and ex-British spies to “coordinate and implement the hack.” He also singled out a Qatari operative named Ahmed al-Rumaihi; to make matters even more byzantine, al-Rumaihi is linked to Michael Cohen—the man who helped facilitate Broidy’s Playmate payoff. Broidy blamed al-Rumaihi and others for using hacks to retaliate against him for his work to undermine Qatar’s standing in Washington. The news that the FBI is investigating the hack adds another layer of drama to the legal fight between Broidy and the Qataris. And it means there’s another high-profile hacking wrapped up in a federal investigation."},
 {'title': 'John Bolton Told Israel: ‘Condi Rice Sold You Out,’ Ex-Official Says',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "TEL AVIV—John Bolton, while serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, went behind his boss’s back to supply Israel with crucial information on American plans at the UN and redirect U.S. policy.That’s according to Israel’s former UN ambassador, Dan Gillerman, and former prime minister Ehud Olmert, who spoke to The Daily Beast on Tuesday. Bolton’s past, especially his controversial tenure at the UN, has come under fresh examination since President Trump named him to be his next national security advisor. Gillerman served as Israel’s ambassador to the UN in 2006 when Bolton was U.S. ambassador and told The Daily Beast that “in more than one case, Ambassador Bolton called me and alerted me to the fact that his mission—the United States mission to the UN—was about to vote against Israel and asked that I alert the prime minister, who at that time was Ehud Olmert.”Gillerman added, “In more than one case the prime minister called the president, who was then George W. Bush, and got him to overrule the State Department.” Bolton would regularly reach out regarding positions being debated by the U.S. government, Gillmerman said. But the “most striking” example came in August 2006 when the UN Security Council was considering Resolution 1701, with the purpose of ending a month-long war between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hezbollah, operating in southern Lebanon.One night, Bolton warned the Israelis what Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was planning.“In that case John Bolton got in touch with me at about 8 o’clock in the evening, which was 3 in the morning in Israel, calling to say ‘You have to call your prime minister and tell him that Condi Rice sold you out to the French.’”Israel and Lebanon do not have diplomatic relations so during the negotiations, Gillerman said, “the French government was representing Lebanon and the United States were representing us, and the French resolution was totally unacceptable to Israel.”“I woke the prime minister up at 3 a.m. Israel time, and that actually brought about a total change in the final resolution,” Gillerman said, but declined to elaborate what aspects of the resolution were changed.“John Bolton got in touch with me, calling to say, ‘You have to call your prime minister and tell him that Condi Rice sold you out to the French.’”— Israel's former UN ambassador, Dan GillermanOlmert corroborated Gillerman’s account in a telephone interview (though he said Gillerman contacted a staffer who transmitted the information to him). Bolton’s assistance to Israel is also mentioned in In the First Person, (B’Guf Rishon) Olmert’s autobiography released last week, the former prime minister said. In her 2011 autobiography, Rice said she learned “several years later” that “Bolton had been sharing information with the Israelis through their U.N. ambassador without permission to do so. That practice had backfired, as the Israeli ambassador was one step behind the discussions between the White House and the prime minister’s office.”Responding to Rice’s comment in 2011, Bolton told The Daily Beast: “Of course I kept the Israelis informed about the state of play in the negotiations. That’s how you treat close allies.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Instead, Bush nominated Bolton to be U.N. ambassador but was rebuffed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Bush used a congressional recess to appoint Bolton to the UN post, where he stayed a little more than a year. “Mr. Bolton clashed regularly with Ms. Rice and, after leaving office, broke with Mr. Bush over what he saw as weak-kneed policies on North Korea and Iran,” the Times reported.Gillerman says “the Bolton story is there were sometimes disagreements between the State Department and the White House and about how the United States should act towards Israel or regarding UN resolutions that interested Israel.” Gillerman declined to divulge details of what he and Bolton discussed, only to say “Bolton was working in a very positive way.”“He was doing his job but at the same time looking out for the interests of Israel,” Gillerman said. “When he felt that the State Department held an unfavorable position he alerted me and we [Israel’s mission to the UN] alerted the National Security Council and the then the President—and changed it.”Olmert said that Bolton “was and is an excellent friend to Israel.”Bolton served at the UN for 16 contentious months marked by repeated clashes with other diplomats and eventually fell out with Bush over the Iraq war, accusing the president of “a total intellectual collapse” in 2008. Bush dismissed Bolton as “not credible.” Since then, Bolton has spent his career as an analyst on Fox News and as a resident at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C."},
 {'title': 'Revealed: Pentagon Push to Hack Nuke Missiles Before They Launch',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Pentagon has embraced a controversial policy of destroying enemy nuclear missiles before they launch, an internal policy document from May 2017 shows. It’s an effort that appears to include executing cyberattacks against missile control systems or components. The Pentagon document does not name adversaries. But experts who reviewed it for The Daily Beast considered it aimed at North Korea—and may represent a fallback option for the Trump administration should its June 12 summit with Kim Jong Un fail to result in the denuclearization President Trump desires. Former State Department nonproliferation official Alexandra Bell called the Pentagon plan an “exercise to legally justify a potential attack on a North Korean missile on the launchpad.”Kingston Reif of the Arms Control Association added, “Like the overall U.S. missile defense effort, the intended role and purpose is North Korea, and possibly Iran, too.” For about four years, senior U.S. military officers have feared that the financial costs of developing interceptors to destroy incoming ballistic missiles could jeopardize a domestic missile shield. They’ve sought what’s called “left of launch” options to disable adversary missiles before they leave the launchpad. And they’ve intimated that a more cost-effective approach is to develop digital weapons to corrupt or disable launch controls, guidance systems or aspects of the missile supply chain. The unclassified document from May 2017, acquired by The Daily Beast, asserts that “pre-conflict left of launch operations” would be legal against an “imminent missile attack,” without defining “imminent.” It explicitly cites “non-kinetic options” for destroying missiles that would fall short of a “use of force” under the United Nations charter. “The document appears to be the first official confirmation that the U.S. reserves the right to infect adversary missile networks with disabling malware.”Missile experts who reviewed the document understood it as representing what appears to be the first official confirmation that the U.S. reserves the right to infect adversary missile networks with disabling malware. It appears to confirm a March 2017 New York Times report that the Pentagon was looking to add digital-network assaults to its antiballistic missile arsenal.“This looks to me like a very elaborate legal justification for left-of-launch cyberattacks,” said Bell, now with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. “This would certainly include cyberattacks on command-and-control or guidance of the missile,” agreed Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategy expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as corresponding physical or digital efforts to preemptively corrupt an adversary’s missile supply chain. The Pentagon document, titled “Declaratory Policy, Concept of Operations and Employment Guidelines for Left-of-Launch Capability,” was acquired by Protect Democracy, a group founded mostly by Obama administration attorneys, through to a transparency lawsuit seeking internal material relevant to military planning about North Korea. The group provided it to The Daily Beast. That report, which Congress mandated during the final year of the Obama administration that the Pentagon issue, refers to cyberattacks euphemistically, rather than explicitly, in its unclassified form. A classified annex to the policy document is almost entirely redacted, but includes a brief reference to a “Special Program for Missile Defeat,” without elaboration. “Although left-of-launch actions that would constitute a use of force likely would require the President’s approval as an exercise of the inherent right of national or collective self-defense, certain actions would not necessarily constitute a use of force under the U.N. Charter, such as gathering intelligence or developing capabilities that could be used in response to an imminent attack,” the document reads.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The military term “kinetic” refers to a physically destructive or violent event. A kinetic strike in an anti-missile context is visible—an incoming missile heading for a launchpad—and an adversary will instantly figure out the missile’s return address. The strategic appeal of a “nonkinetic” cyberattack on missile infrastructure lies in its invisibility and the corresponding doubt it would presumably instill in an adversary over whether the missile infrastructure was sabotaged or merely technically flawed. “It’s a disruptive technology, the weaponization of which, along with other advanced missile concepts like offensive hypersonic weapons, are putting significant strain on strategic stability,” Reif said. All this, experts said, represents an evolution of so-called counterforce, a nuclear strategy that seeks to destroy enemy missiles. Strategists consider counterforce a particularly dangerous approach, as it risks incentivizing an adversary to use their nuclear missiles before the U.S. can target them. Additionally, a counterforce approach needs to identify and successfully target all adversary missiles—something that, as with North Korea’s highly opaque and mobile missile program, may not always be possible. “Counterforce had two components: disabling the adversary’s nuclear missile systems on the ground, coupled with a missile defense system that intercepts residual [missiles]... This is the unholy marriage of both.”— Vipin Narang“Counterforce has always had two components: disabling the adversary’s nuclear missile systems on the ground, coupled with a missile defense system that intercepts residual [missiles] that you miss in the early phase of a campaign,” Narang said. “This is the unholy marriage of both.” Added Reif of the Arms Control Association, “We can’t counterforce or missile defense our way out of vulnerability to North Korea. Left of launch blurs the line between offensive counterforce and missile defense.”Catherine Dill, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, worried less about incentivizing an adversary missile launch than in accelerating a digital arms race tied to nuclear war. “If this is the declaratory policy of the United States, I’d worry that other states would try to match these capabilities. That’s where the escalatory potential is,” Dill said.In a 2014 memo, the chief officers of the Army and Navy warned that an “acquisition-based strategy” of purchasing interceptor missiles, the backbone of the domestic U.S. missile shield, was increasingly “unsustainable.” They called for a new strategy, they wrote, that “incorporates ‘left-of-launch’ and other non-kinetic means of defense.” That accelerated a search for “left of launch” options in defense circles—something Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described to Congress last month as a priority.“One of the primary efforts right now is in missile defense, for example. How do we take out missiles from the air, and do it a lot more cheaply then very expensive interceptor kill vehicles. We have to find a cheaper way to do this against a growing threat,” Mattis told a House panel on April 12. Preemptively disabling or destroying adversary missiles may soon become an urgent issue if next month’s massive nuclear summit with North Korea collapses. On June 12, Trump is scheduled to meet with North Korean dictator Kim in Singapore. While the administration initially raised expectations for ending Pyongyang’s nuclear program peacefully, North Korean officials have recently sent signals that no amount of U.S. inducement can cleave Kim from a nuclear arsenal bequeathed to him by his father and grandfather. Trump has recently worried the summit could “turn into a political embarrassment,” The New York Times reported. After North Korean officials expressed acrimony at national security adviser John Bolton’s invocation of the “Libya Model”—which Pyongyang read as a reminder that the U.S. helped kill Libya’s Moammar Qaddafi after Qaddafi gave up his far less developed nuclear program—Trump mused: “that model would take place if we don’t make a deal, most likely.”“In a 2014 memo, the chief officers of the Army and Navy warned that purchasing interceptor missiles, the backbone of the domestic U.S. missile shield, was increasingly ‘unsustainable.’”The Pentagon “Left of Launch” document cautions that a decision to attack an enemy’s missiles ahead of an outbreak of military hostilities “must be made at the highest levels of the U.S. Government.” But it does not envision any legal restraint on a president’s authority to order such an attack. And it explicitly explicitly declares a willingness for the U.S. to strike first, physically or digitally, to an “imminent” missile launch—though its definition of the term is unclear and occasionally opportunistic.“An important factor to be considered in assessing whether an attack is ‘imminent’ is the amount of time available to take action to counter the threat, including whether there is substantial danger of missing a limited window of opportunity to prevent widespread harm,” the document states. The “nature and immediacy of the threat” and the “probability of an attack” are described as “other important circumstances.” Dill, Reif and other experts consulted by The Daily Beast expected the “left-of-launch” document to be incorporated into an overdue and highly anticipated Pentagon document called the Missile Defense Review. A Pentagon spokesman, Tom Crosson, said that the department expected the document to be released later this month or in early June. Crosson did not respond to follow-up questions about cyberattacks or the “Left of Launch” document factoring into the review. Alison Murphy, a lawyer for Protect Democracy, said its Freedom of Information lawsuit that produced the Pentagon document was designed “to ensure that Congress and the American people understand the legal basis, and constraints, for potential military conflict with North Korea. That's the least that our citizens, and the members of Congress representing them, are due in our democracy.”"},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump Should Fire Kelly Sadler Over Her McCain Remarks, and Today',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'There’s a Bible verse that says, “Out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.” I thought about this when I read that a White House aide had flippantly dismissed John McCain’s views about torture, reasoning that “he’s dying anyway.” This is callous and inhumane. And rather than being a mistake, it’s a classic Washington gaffe, in that it betrays what is really in one’s heart. It leaves you scratching your head, asking the question: What kind of person thinks like this, let alone, talks like this? Apparently White House aide Kelly Sadler, a special assistant to the president who previously worked for the Washington Times. Sadler’s sadistic comments created a media firestorm, and she has reportedly apologized to Meghan McCain. Anyone who talks for a living tends to be forgiving when she misspeaks, but some things are so reprehensible they can’t be taken back. Perhaps it was a joke? If so, it was a revealing one.Her suggestion that the senior senator from Arizona is, because of his battle with brain cancer, irrelevant had to do with McCain’s decision to oppose President Trump’s nomination of Gina Haspel as CIA director. During her testimony, Haspel said she would not restart the so-called “enhanced interrogation program.” Additionally, she said that she would not allow the CIA to do something she deemed immoral, even if it was legal, at the president’s request. But Haspel also defended her past role in enhanced interrogation, prompting McCain to conclude that "her refusal to acknowledge torture\'s immorality is disqualifying."“In Vietnam, John McCain endured a fate worse than death, but instead of parades, he must endure mockery as he prepares for his final journey to his eternal home.”One could respectfully disagree with McCain’s position; Sadler disrespectfully disagreed. God knows John McCain has earned the right—both by virtue of having been a P.O.W. and by virtue of his membership in the world’s greatest deliberative body—to hold this opinion. I probably don’t need to recount the years of torture McCain endured at the “Hanoi Hilton,” or the fact that he refused early release, knowing that it would be dishonorable, a violation of the established code of conduct; or the fact that, because he was the son of an admiral who would be accepting preferential treatment, his release would be a p.r. coup for the North Vietnamese and a moral-breaker for Americans held captive. It would be wrong to mock anyone battling brain cancer, but it’s especially unseemly when that person has sacrificed more for his country than you or I ever will. Of course, Sadler isn’t alone. On Fox Business, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, referred to McCain as “Songbird John,” a bogus allegation that McCain collaborated with his captures. \xa0A few days ago, I wrote a piece defending McCain against similar attacks on Twitter. In response, I got an email from an old friend, saying: “There are Men who have earned the highest military honor who have said John McCain is ‘no man of honor’ and ‘is an embarrassment to the Naval Uniform and flag on it.’ Didn’t like your piece and the STFU comment at all.” (The “STFU” headline was written by my editor, but it was not an inaccurate representation of my views.)

What we are witnessing is a microcosm of some of the problems we are seeing in the Republican Party—and in America, in general. We do not have reverence or respect for life or for the vulnerable. We do not respect our elders. Nor do we have reverence or respect for sacrifice or service. We prioritize politics over decency and humanity. This is why I think Donald Trump should fire Sadler, today. And if that’s too heavy a lift, I have a more modest request: I would like to see Sadler read this account of the treatment McCain endured in Vietnam. That would likely be as close to torture as she will ever experience. \xa0Of course, it’s really hard for Trump to fire Sadler since he also mocked McCain’s service, saying he’s “not a war hero.” When a leader says things such as this, underlings get the sense that they can do it, too. This comment wasn’t random; it was a predictable result of a debased culture where people really think this way. Trump should (but won’t) correct this by apologizing for what he said, too.In Vietnam, John McCain endured a fate worse than death, but instead of parades, he must endure mockery as he prepares for his final journey to his eternal home. The ultimate irony is that it isn’t liberal hippies or young anti-war protesters who are disrespecting him—it’s members of an allegedly conservative Republican administration who are spitting on this P.O.W.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Phone Is a Hacker’s Dream',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Earlier this week, Politico broke the news that President Donald Trump refuses to give up using off-the-shelf mobile phones, the imposition of better security being considered “too inconvenient.” While it would be difficult to hack these phones, it can be done, and there are few targets of a higher priority to potential hackers than the president of the United States.According to the Politico report, Trump uses two phones: one that allows access only to Twitter and a small number of news outlets, and one for making phone calls. Both phones are periodically inspected and replaced, although the exact length of time that Trump keeps each phone is unclear. Politico reports that the president has gone as long as five months without having one of the phones reviewed by security personnel. In comparison, President Barack Obama’s secured mobile devices were inspected every 30 days.Trump’s use of these phones, on this schedule, does keep things convenient for the president, but also carries significant security risks. Despite efforts by White House security staff to prevent or detect compromises, the phones could still be hacked. Fear of the political fallout if efforts are detected might deter attackers more than anything that could be done to secure the phones themselves, but not every attacker worries so much about that as to forgo possible direct access to the communications of the president of the United States.Of the two devices, Trump’s Twitter-and-news phone is the easier to target. It is not clear if the pre-loaded news outlets are accessed through apps or bookmarked sites, but it doesn’t really matter which is the case. The goal for an attacker would likely be to get Trump to open a specific page in a browser that could deliver an exploit. If the president had already opened his browser, that makes things a little easier, but Twitter and news apps have in-app browsers and content that is only viewable on them. These links could be made to look like a trusted site, or even be on a news outlet favored by Trump that had itself been hacked. All apps for iOS that browse the web must use Safari libraries, and Safari offers a substantial attack surface. The bigger challenge for an attacker is creating a link that Trump can’t resist clicking on. Preventing people clicking on risky links has been an uphill struggle for the IT security community for years, and Trump does not appear to be the kind of person to critically consider each thing he looks at, so this also may not be that difficult. The actual hard part is hacking just Trump. If the link were in a news outlet, or tweeted publically at Trump so prominently that he would notice it, many more people would also see and click on it, and then be infected as well. One can reduce the number of inadvertent victims by restricting infections only to people in a certain geographical area or by other general criteria, but even so, an attacker will still be owning a lot more people than just the president.This is noisy. It makes detection more likely and requires being able to pick out the president among the many victims. This can be done, but requires time and resources to do so, and in that time an attack could be detected by any of the victims.An easier option would be to send Trump a direct message. This only works if Trump, or other people managing Trump’s phones, did not disable DMs, although a man who loves Twitter and disregards security obstacles as much as Trump may not have done so.Assuming DMs work, the biggest obstacle to this approach is first compromising someone able to message Trump, as DMs can typically only be sent by someone that the recipient is following. Fortunately for an attacker, some of the 46 people currently followed by @realDonaldTrump are significantly softer targets than the president himself. It is far easier to hack media personalities and Trump supporters than the president of the United States, even this one.There is still the risk that one of the staffers who sometimes tweet on Trump’s behalf might click on the link instead of him, but they are also attractive espionage targets themselves and could be used for further attacks on other White House resources, or even other Trump accounts. They could also be used in the first steps of an effort to socially engineer Trump himself to click on a link from a phone, or from an even more valuable computer.In many ways, Trump’s trusted staffers are easier targets. Not only are they easier to hack, they are easier to reach in the real world. If such a staffer were so unlucky as to have a phone stolen while on an official trip or to even lose a record of their password, so much the better for an attacker.Hacking the call-only phone requires better quality exploits than hacking a mobile browser, but it is quite doable. Such an attack would require knowing Trump’s phone number, but a motivated espionage program should have that. A phone that makes and receives calls could also receive SMS, and there is already public research on different ways for attacker to get control of a smartphone by sending an SMS, including one that does not appear in the phone’s inbox. World-class espionage programs certainly have this capability, and even second-tier nations can likely buy it. Such exploits are rare and expensive, but a target like the president of the United States is worth it.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

This is easier on the Twitter phone, as clicking on legitimate links and loading content creates enough traffic in which to hide illicit communication. On the phone-calls phone, this is a little harder. The president’s phones should have some serious network monitoring, meaning that any suspicious traffic would be identified as such, and without much data leaving that phone, the stolen information would stand out. Still, a sophisticated attacker could possibly evade this, particularly given the months-long periods between submitting phones for detailed inspection.Hacking Trump’s phones would be expensive, and risky, but for many countries, it would be worth it. Even with the GPS turned off, an attacker could triangulate Trump’s location from when it connects to Wi-Fi or mobile towers, and therefore guess at his activities. The cameras and microphones are still on the phones—seeing what Trump looks at and listening to his conversations would have tremendous intelligence value. The call-only phone would allow an attacker to listen to the president’s calls, something that would always interest an intelligence program, but which is even more valuable with a president who is so often unclear about his intentions and frequently changes his mind. Even just knowing with whom Trump communicates, and how often, would be very interesting to most countries and would provide an attacker a new list of high-priority targets for future attacks.All of this assumes that these phones are “on lockdown,” but the Politico report doesn’t make it clear exactly what that means. Does Trump connect to the White House network with these phones? What about Mar-a-Largo, where security is laxer? What about mobile services in other countries? Even with limited usability, there are different ways for an attacker to expand their access, or to find a way in. It is hard to say without further information, but theoretically attacks could go much further than described here.Trump is not the first person to forgo security in favor of convenience. Hillary Clinton famously did so when she used a private server to send emails (something for which Trump wanted to “lock her up,”) as do quite a few less famous people every day. In many cases, this trade-off makes sense, as the absolute risk is low. In the case of the president of the United States, the risk is high. Obama called using a secure phone “no fun,” but he still used it. Trump could too. Unfortunately for this president, fun is apparently more important than protecting his own secrets, and the nation’s."},
 {'title': 'Embattled GOP Gov. Eric Greitens Defiantly Resigns: ‘I Have Not Broken Any Laws’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens finally resigned from office on Tuesday, following a lengthy and scandalous legal battle stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct and abusive behavior. He resignation is effective on Friday evening.  In a statement on Tuesday, Greitens remained adamant that he did not break any laws and vowed to “be a fighter for the people of Missouri.” Following his brief remarks, reporters shouted questions to which he did not respond. Not only was Greitens involved in a sexual-misconduct scandal but he also faced allegations of misusing a charity donor list. His scandalous behavior and adamant refusal to step down had been a drag on the party for months, even sparking concern that his position at the head of the state\'s Republican party would endanger the prospects of defeating incumbent Sen. Clare McCaskill (D-MO) in November.In late February, Greitens was indicted on a felony invasion of privacy charge due to an incident that took place on or around March 21, 2015. At the time, Greitens allegedly carried on an extramarital affair with a woman who has thus far remained anonymous. According to prosecutors, Greitens “knowingly photographed” the woman while she was nude and had a “reasonable expectation of privacy.”Greitens was initially defiant in response, saying he made a “personal mistake” but “did not commit a crime.”St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner dropped her prosecution in May, yet legislative leaders said the move would not impact their decision to potentially pursue impeachment. The issue first arose in January of 2018 when a man secretly recorded his wife admitting to the 2015 affair with Greitens. She contended in the recording that the governor took a photo of her when she was partially naked and threatened to release that photograph if she spoke out publicly about the affair.In an April report from the Missouri House Special Investigative Committee on Oversight, the woman alleged that Greitens was at times physically abusive with her. She testified to the committee that in one instance, Greitens shoved her to the ground. “And I instantly just started bawling and was just like, ‘What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?’\u2009” the woman allegedly said. “And I just laid there crying while he was just like ... ‘You’re fine, you’re fine.’\u2009”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Describing the incident in which Greitens allegedly took the photo, the report includes the following from the woman\'s interview: "Witness 1 testified that Greitens taped her hands to pull-up rings with “this gauzed tape stuff” and then put a blindfold on her. Witness 1 testified that these items were laying on a “workout bench right there, and that’s where he had that stuff.”She allegedly went on to say that Greitens ripped open her shirt without consent and started pulling her pants down.  “[T]hen I hear him kind of, like, step back – take a step back and I hear – I can hear like a, like a cell phone – like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold," the report reads. According to the report, the woman also said that Greitens told her: “You’re not going to mention my name. Don’t even mention my name to anybody at all, because if you do, I’m going to take these pictures, and I’m going to put them everywhere I can. They are going to be everywhere, and then everyone will know what a little whore you are.”She also contended that later in that encounter, Greitens kept her from leaving his home and insisted that she perform oral sex on him. "He starts undoing his pants, and he takes his penis out and puts it, like, near where my face is," the report reads. "And I’m like – so this guy literally just wants me for this, and this is all he wants, and then he’ll let me – because at this point, too, I also know I have to be at work, and he’s not going to let me leave, because he’s obviously still horny. So I gave him oral sex at this point."Greitens has declined to say whether he took a photo. '},
 {'title': 'How John Bolton Helped Kickstart the New Nuclear Arms Race',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It was March 1 and Vladimir Putin was feeling invincible.Russian advancements in intercontinental ballistic missile modernization, maneuverable-trajectory hypersonic missiles, and even a nuclear-fueled cruise missile carrying a nuclear payload, the Russian president boasted, would make short work of America’s antiballistic missile defenses. In case there was any ambiguity to Putin’s fiery Kremlin address, Putin underscored his point—Russia can hold any U.S. city at risk in the event of a conflict—with an animated video showing a Sarmat missile strike on Florida, home of Donald Trump’s cherished Mar-a-Lago resort. “Sarmat is a very powerful, mighty weapon,” Putin said. “Due to its characteristics, nothing, not even prospective antiballistic missile systems could be an obstacle for it.” Putin’s speech followed on the heels of two Trump administration steps with significant implications for the nuclear balance of terror. In December, the administration released a strategy document, the brainchild of national security adviser H.R. McMaster, that embraced a return to “great-power competition” between Washington and Moscow.To back it up, in February, the Pentagon’s Nuclear Posture Review committed the U.S. to expanding the “flexibility and range” of its own nuclear weapons (PDF), at the cost of over $1 trillion, and including the development of a “low yield” nuke that arms control experts fear will tempt policymakers into using it. But Putin was not responding to anything Trump had done. He wasn’t even responding to anything Barack Obama had done. The revived buildup of apocalyptic weaponry began, in Putin’s eyes, a decade and a half earlier, with a fateful decision by George W. Bush’s administration: to back out of the seminal arms control pact known as the Anti-Ballistic Missile, or ABM, Treaty. “If you were to speak about ‘arms race,’” Putin told NBC’s Megan Kelly, “then an arms race began at exactly the time and moment when the U.S. opted out of the Anti-Missile Treaty.” Putin’s March 1 speech spoke bitterly of shadowy forces who have tried to “escalate the arms race for the past 15 years.” (Never mind the arms-limitation treaties he signed with Bush in 2002 and Obama in 2010.) Russia’s maturing nuclear arsenal, Putin boasted, was the fruit of Washington’s ABM folly: “You didn’t listen to our country then. Listen to us now.” It is unlikely the Trump administration will listen—especially now that McMaster is being supplanted as national security adviser by John Bolton. As Bush’s undersecretary of state for arms control, Bolton was the State Department’s principal advocate of tearing up the ABM Treaty—and, as an envoy to Moscow over the arrangement, was the one who ripped it up in the Kremlin’s face.Since Bolton’s elevation to national security adviser, much has been made of his bellicose statements toward North Korea and Iran, his continued defense of the disastrous Iraq War, and his much-vocalized contempt for arms-reduction agreements, particularly the 2015 Iran deal. Far less attention has gone to his role in getting rid of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty—a footnote buried in the accumulated foreign-policy wreckage of the Bush administration, but one bitterly remembered in Moscow, where it contributed to the present reemergence of U.S.-Russia antagonism. Bolton was hardly alone in counseling the end of the ABM Treaty. Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, National Security Council staffer Robert Joseph were key actors, and the Reagan era elevated missile defense into right-wing catechism. Bolton added his particularly pugilistic style. He mocked what he called the “Church of Arms Control” the year before taking office as the State Department’s top arms-control official. “When we cancelled the ABM Treaty, we did two things,” said Jim Walsh, a nuclear-strategy scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We embarrassed Russia, we left them hanging. That’s a psychological effect, but there was also a direct consequence for their national security: If we build a missile defense, the only way they can respond is to build new missiles. That’s why we had an ABM Treaty in the first place, because we knew missile defense leads to arms races and creates strategic instability.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“John Bolton is politically and culturally at the center of that,” Walsh continued. “He believes in weapons over diplomacy, and coercion over negotiation. Whether it’s being pro-missile defense, pro-regime change, or anti-UN, the record there has been a remarkably consistent one.” Bush came into the White House determined to build a ballistic missile shield. But with the Cold War over and missile threats from Iran, Iraq, and North Korea at the fore of his mind, Bush didn’t consider that Russia would truly care about getting rid of the 1972 ABM Treaty, the obstacle to his plans. Instead, Bush appeared to convince himself that the Cold War vestige was actually an obstacle to improved relations with Putin. “It’s a piece of paper that’s codified a relationship that no longer exists. It codified a hateful relationship. And now we’ve got a friendly relationship,” Bush said during Putin’s November 2001 visit to the White House. Putin, standing beside Bush, was substantially less enthusiastic. “On the issues of missile defense,” Putin rejoindered, “the position of Russia remains unchanged.” But there was little Putin could do about it. In 2001, Russian power was still mired in its post-Soviet nadir. Moscow seethed impotently at the ABM withdrawal.\xa0In talks with U.S. diplomats throughout the year, largely with Bolton taking the American lead, Russian officials said getting out of the deal would undermine “the entire framework of international security.” Moscow took multiple approaches to underscore its dissatisfaction. It threatened an arms race. It rejected a Washington entreaty to tear up the treaty bilaterally, and offered instead to modify the treaty in a manner that might satisfy Washington—which the U.S., through Bolton, rejected. It back-burnered opposition after the 9/11 attacks in the hope Bush would do the same. But the brutal truth was that the Kremlin was in little position to do anything but acquiesce.Bolton was the point man for ABM Treaty diplomacy with the Russians—itself a signal that there was no doubting Bush’s intention to get out. Bolton even went to Moscow the week after the 9/11 attacks to underscore the point, and felt nothing of wrapping a U.S. missile shield in the bloody shirt of a terrorist attack that the shield would never have stopped. “While missile defense would not have prevented this abomination,” Bolton said at the time, “it does show that the United States faces severe threats from terrorism and from rogue states, and that among the things we have to continue to work on is missile defense.”Bolton’s offer to Moscow was Corleone-esque: nothing. An anonymous U.S. official told The Washington Post’s Russia correspondent, during a Bolton sojourn to the Kremlin, that the Russians “realized that maybe we’re not going to negotiate on this before the treaty is gone.”Bolton would soon gloat—on the record—that he had gotten the Russians to recognize that U.S. withdrawal from the treaty was an uncomfortable pill they nevertheless needed to swallow. “I tried to convince the Russians when I was in Moscow last week how serious we are about withdrawing from this treaty,” Bolton remarked. “I said: ‘You need to start understanding this treaty as a six-month treaty, renewable on a daily basis.’ And I think that got their attention.”The Bush administration permitted Putin to save a modicum of face. Bush, in May 2002, committed to reducing the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Once again it was Bolton who negotiated the details with the Russian deputy foreign minister—after Putin insisted on a formal agreement—and once again it was Bolton who underscored Washington’s red lines. Among Bolton’s priorities during negotiations, he said, was not “starting a process that limits our national missile defense.”America could do as it liked at the time of its ABM withdrawal. It was the height of its post-Soviet unipolar advantage: Not only did the U.S. enjoy the world’s sympathy after 9/11, it had yet to squander its diplomatic and military power with the Iraq invasion. “There was Bolton, taking advantage of a moment of Russian relative weakness,” said Thomas Countryman, a longtime U.S. diplomat who worked on arms control, and who the Trump administration pushed out last year. Usually, taking advantage of a rival’s weakness is par for the diplomatic course. But nuclear strategy is maddening. It turns conventional military strategy on its head in a deeply emotionally unsatisfying manner. Conventionally, defenses aren’t just desirable, but unquestionably necessary. But in a nuclear context, a successful missile defense system is provocative, “because people worry if they have a stable deterrent against their adversary,” Walsh explains.Conventionally, a wise nation wishes to instill confusion amongst the enemy. But in a nuclear context, confusion is destabilizing and can inadvertently provoke a nuclear exchange. Trump’s favorite general, Douglas MacArthur, famously remarked that there is no substitute for victory. But in a nuclear war, victory means annihilation, and the mark of success is stability—stability shared with adversaries we often hate.Russia’s fixation on U.S. missile defenses may seem to Americans exotic, irrational, or pretextual. Putin is certainly no stranger to cynical manipulations of the factual record when seeking Russian advantage. But Austin Long of the Rand Corporation recently observed in a War on the Rocks essay that Russia’s World War II and Cold War experience created an “abiding fear and respect for U.S. nuclear and missile defense capabilities” leading to Putin’s March 1 nuclear modernization display. The ABM Treaty was born out of reasonable Soviet fears of the more-capable U.S. nuclear arsenal; so it was “better that neither side have missile defenses than the United States be superior in offense and defense.” By the Reagan era, Long continues, “the Soviet leadership, fearful of renewed missile defense competition and U.S. nuclear modernization, began to mull exactly the sort of systems Putin revealed this month. They did so not because they were crazy, but because they were deeply fearful that the United States would resume missile defense competition in parallel with a competition over the quality of strategic nuclear forces.” Trump’s Nuclear Posture Review suggests that those Russian concerns remain salient. Countryman, the former State Department official, notes that unlike the document’s Obama-era predecessor, February’s version neglected to include a line assuring Russia that U.S. missile defenses are not intended to undermine the Russian nuclear deterrent, “and I expect the Russians will read something into that admission.” Better, then, from Putin’s perspective, for Russia to declare that its missile development has advanced to a point that renders futile America’s continued focus on a missile shield.“While I think the Russian concerns are far-fetched—I do not have the same confidence in missile defense and its effectiveness—these are real concerns for the Russians, or at least they have convinced themselves they’re real. And it’s led them to the kind of programs to defeat missile defense that Mr. Putin announced on March 1,” Countryman said. Sixteen years after the death of the ABM Treaty, there is only the thinnest of U.S. antiballistic missile shields—44 ground-based interceptors of uncertain reliability, along with the Navy’s ship-borne Aegis system—as its technical complexity remains extraordinary. The latest interceptor test, conducted off Hawaii, failed in late January, much as its predecessor did. Regardless, the tragic irony of missile defense in a strategic context is that the more successful U.S. interceptors become, the more destabilizing the Russians will consider them.But missile shield advocates nevertheless convinced themselves that withdrawing from the ABM Treaty was an unqualified victory—a perspective that implies future arms-control abrogations will encounter no reprisal. When Joseph left the Bush administration in 2007, he remarked: “No one even thinks about the ABM Treaty anymore, which is a true measure of [withdrawal’s] success.”Another Bush-team arms control official, John Rood, gloated at a 2013 Heritage Foundation forum that he still had a New York Times editorial from the ABM Treaty withdrawal era warning of an invitation to an arms race: “Apparently the invitation got lost in the mail on the way to whoever the recipients were to be.”Putin’s March 1 announcement, however, underscores that the Russians merely respond at a time of their choosing. “America,” influential parliamentarian Alexei Arbatov remarked to The Washington Post in August 2002, “has gotten used to taking Russia for nothing.” Today, with Russians fielded in Syria, occupying Ukraine and disrupting U.S. political discourse, America is no longer taking Russia for nothing.The legacy of the ABM Treaty withdrawal, and the conservative misapprehension of its consequences, suggests to Walsh and Countryman that Bolton will encourage Trump to rip up more arms-control deals. That starts with the Iran deal in May—and perhaps accordingly precludes a pact with North Korea, despite the anticipated Trump-Kim summit—but doesn’t end there. Getting rid of the Reagan-era Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty may be on Bolton’s agenda, both Walsh and Countryman fear. The treaty limits missiles with a range of 300 to 3500 miles, disproportionately constraining the Russian arsenal, and last year, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified that Russia has violated it. “The U.S. has a choice here,” Walsh added, “sit down with the Russians and try to negotiate it out, or simply wave a wand and say we’re not gonna put up with this, you’re in violation and we’re pulling out.” Observes Countryman: “To get us to take the blame more than Russia [by withdrawing] would be a public-relations coup for them.”Trump appears inclined to slip into that mode. NBC reported Thursday night that during Trump’s recent congratulatory phone call to Putin, Trump blustered, “If you want to have an arms race we can do that, but I’ll win.”For Countryman, the ABM Treaty episode is only one critical case in which Bolton was proven “spectacularly wrong” on his area of ostensible expertise. The Iraq War he championed was a debacle whose consequences included squandering American military power and expanding Iran’s hold over the Middle East. Bolton greeted North Korea’s violation of the 1994 Agreed Framework by rejecting negotiations; now North Korea is a nuclear power. Then Bolton refused “to negotiate except on unacceptable terms” with an Iran that had a mere few dozen centrifuges, rather than the several thousand that spurred the 2015 Iran deal Bolton wants to end. With so much riding on a peaceful diplomatic resolution of so many pivotal nuclear and missile threats, Countryman said, Bolton is “the last man you should trust.”"},
 {'title': 'Michael Avenatti, After Firm Loses $10M Dispute: ‘I’m Not a Celebrity, I’m a Lawyer’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Michael Avenatti\'s law firm has been ordered to pay $10 million in a legal dispute with a former colleague who claims the firm stiffed him of millions in profits. On Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge Catherine Bauer awarded the massive payout to ex-employee Jason Frank, the Los Angeles Times reported. “At this point, that’s what’s appropriate,” Bauer said at the Santa Ana, California hearing, according to the Times. Last week, Frank filed a suit claiming the fame-hungry lawyer’s firm, Eagan Avenatti, missed a $2-million payment. It was supposed to be the first of two installments stemming from a bankruptcy settlement. When reached by The Daily Beast on Tuesday, Avenatti said, “I’m disgusted by the press’s fascination with my personal business and my personal life.” Avenatti said the bankruptcy suit “does not in any way relate” to his client Stormy Daniels’ fight against President Trump and his loyal “fixer” and personal attorney Michael Cohen.“Who cares?” Avenatti told The Daily Beast. “What does my personal business have to do with the case? Nothing?” He said the firm, Eagan Avenatti, doesn’t represent Daniels. (Court documents show Avenatti & Associates represent Daniels, though the lawyer continues communicating through his Eagan Avenatti email.)After the Times broke the story on the judgment, Avenatti accused Cohen of leaking audio tapes of Daniels to the press. In a letter to U.S District Court judge Kimba Wood, Avenatti wrote, “We\xa0have reason to believe that plaintiff Michael Cohen, or members of his team, have begun to leak select audio recordings to the media that were seized in the FBI raids.”When a Daily Beast reporter suggested Avenatti was a public figure and deemed a folk hero among liberals for his fight against Cohen and Trump, Avenatti said, “I’m not a celebrity. I’m a lawyer representing a client. Who cares?” Despite his star power, he added, “That’s nice, but I don’t necessarily subscribe to that.”“What you should be talking about is the leaked audio recordings. That’s actually of relevance,” Avenatti concluded. The lawyer has been a ubiquitous TV presence since his pornstar client’s battle with President Trump made her—and him—household names.The firm\'s bankruptcy setback comes as Avenatti has requested to intervene in the federal case revolving around Cohen, whose office, home, and hotel room was raided by the FBI last month. The feds are investigating Cohen’s $130,000 payout to Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election, among other things.Frank worked at Eagan Avenatti from February 2009 to May 20, 2016. In February 2016, Frank filed a demand for arbitration, accusing Eagan Avenatti of owing him millions of dollars from his stint as an independent contractor. Frank was promised 25 percent of the Newport Beach firm’s annual profits and 20 percent of the fees he generated from clients, Courthouse News Service reported.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The firm had agreed to pay Frank a total of $4.85 million.Frank declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast. His attorney, Eric George, didn’t respond by press time. Avenatti\'s firm also agreed to pay the Internal Revenue Serve $2.4 million in back taxes, penalties and interest, according to the Times report. (About $1.3 million of that was for payroll taxes that the firm withheld apparently from workers but that wasn’t paid to the government.)The legal eagle\'s firm defaulted on the back taxes, and the government plans to file a motion demanding payment, an assistant U.S. attorney said at Tuesday’s hearing. According to the Times, Avenatti\'s firm has paid at least $1.5 million of what it owes to the IRS. (Avenatti\'s firm has blamed the unpaid taxes on a payroll company.)“Over blown. Sensational reporting at its finest. No judgment against me was issued nor do I owe any taxes,” Avenatti wrote in an email to the Times.Frank’s lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claimed “Avenatti has no valid excuse for failing to perform this obligation,” the Times reported.In February 2017, an arbitration panel of three retired judges found Avenatti’s firm “acted with malice, oppression and fraud” by hiding its revenues and failing to give copies of tax returns to Frank, according to the Times report. (In response, Avenatti told a Times reporter Frank’s lawsuit “frivolous and baseless” and “old news.”)The panel found Avenatti’s firm “intentionally and knowingly violated” an order to provide Frank with the tax returns and financial records. Meanwhile, a “purported creditor” named Gerald Tobin filed a petition in Florida to put Avenatti’s firm into involuntary bankruptcy over an $28,700 invoice, Frank’s lawsuit alleged. This petition came only two days before a scheduled March 2017 deposition, effectively postponing arbitration in Frank’s case.During a hearing for Tobin’s petition, bankruptcy judge Karen Jennemann said the maneuver had “a stench of impropriety,” according to the Times. Jennemann added that she couldn’t tell whether Tobin “has some relationship with the firm that would have induced a collusive filing or Eagan Avenatti just got plain lucky and someone filed on the eve of arbitration."According to court filings, in March of this year, Frank agreed to waive his right to collect the entire $10 million “if and only if, [Eagan Avenatti] timely paid the following settlement payments according to schedule.”Avenatti’s firm agreed to wire Frank $2 million within 60 days, and $2.85 million within 120 days, court papers allege.—Additional reporting by Lisa Schwartz Update: The original version of this article stated that Michael Avenatti owed $10 million and had agreed to pay $2.4 million to the IRS. We have updated the story to reflect that the settlement was against his firm Eagan Avenatti and the firm promised to pay $2.4 million in back taxes, penalties and interest.'},

Todd Rokita says in the TV spot targeting incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly.Rokita is running for the Republican nomination against Rep. Luke Messer and Mike Braun, a businessman. The primary will be on May 8. In many GOP primaries across the country, candidates have been vying to be the most pro-Trump they can be. Last night during a West Virginia GOP primary debate, all the candidates agreed that Mueller\'s probe should end. Rokita has been trying his hardest to flex his pro-Trump bonafides, even donning a "Make America Great Again" hat in a previous ad and bringing a cardboard cutout of the president to some campaign events. Additionally, Trump\'s re-election campaign reportedly asked Rokita to take down yard signs that gave the impression that he had been endorsed by the president. Ironically, in a February 2016 interview, Rokita reportedly expressed support for Marco Rubio for president."When you see Marco contrasted with Donald Trump — I mean someone who is vulgar, if not profane," Rokita said. "At some point you have to be presidential. People expect that and you see that in Marco Rubio."The Indiana Senate race is one of ten contests in November where Democrats will be defending seats in contests that Trump won handily in 2016. '},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Trade Bloviation Is Becoming Policy—That’s Petrifying',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "How big a deal are the tariffs that Trump formally announced on Thursday? Pretty big, I fear.If you were thinking of importing some steel or aluminum from the European Union, Canada, or Mexico, you’d better act quickly. As of midnight tonight, imports on these metals from those places will face tariffs of 25 and 10 percent, respectively.The tariffs will bump up overall prices only a tiny bit, too little for anyone to distinguish from all the other determinants of inflation. It should also help boost capacity in U.S. steel production. But it will hurt the many more American producers and employees for whom these metals are inputs. Added to these effects will be the higher costs of other imports, as countries hit by Trump’s tariffs are already outlining retaliatory measures. But what worries me more than the tariffs is the shift from the Trump administration’s shift from bark to bite. Up until now, most of Trump’s rhetoric on trade has been just that: bloviation without action. Given my well-honed skepticism about this administration’s ability to genuinely help those workers hurt by trade, this shift from bloviation to actionable policy is more troubling than reassuring.To understand why the tariffs going into effect at midnight may not be that big a deal as what could come later, it’s helpful to go through a few economic facts first. Steel and aluminum comprise less than two percent of our importsWhile the prices of these metals will climb more noticeably, to get to the overall price effect, we must consider both the weight of these products in our price measures and the fact that only part of the price increase will get passed forward to purchasers. Goldman Sachs researchers ran the numbers and estimated that the steel tariffs will raise prices on steel by around 0.03 percentage points (3 one-hundredths of a percent); the impact of the aluminum tariffs will be much smaller. I do worry a bit more about this fact: less than 200,000 domestic workers produce these metals here in the U.S. But more than 6 million work in industries that use them as inputs. It’s possible that we will see a sharper bite from the tariffs and more direct job displacements in these input industries. But to really wrap your head around potential impacts, you have to consider a slew of knock-on effects. While we don’t yet know the magnitude of retaliation by our trading partners, we do know the form they will take: countervailing tariffs on stuff we import. After all, if I were a European trade minister, I’d be seriously pissed off right about now. That said, it is notable that relative to other advanced economies, the U.S. is pretty insulated against foreign tariffs. We import about 15 percent of GDP, compared to 40 percent for Mexico, 33 percent for Canada, and almost 40 percent for Germany. Thus, here again I don’t expect we’d be able to parse out the price effects from retaliatory tariffs on overall price movements, though they’ll be in there. Other knock-on effects could be the failure to renegotiate NAFTA and a lot more trade conflict with China. There are, for example, real problems with NAFTA that Trump’s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, is trying to fix (e.g., the broken, inequitable dispute settlement process). We shouldn’t assume that any such renegotiations are without merit. But Thursday’s actions by Trump could complicate a resolution. \xa0But as noted above, what I find most concerning is the prospect of Trumpian trade policy unleashed. Team Trump is trying to solve the right problem--helping people and places hurt by trade--with the wrong solution, one on which Trump is now likely to double and triple down. Trump lives for this sort of fight, and I can easily see him dialing up the disruption to no good end from the perspective of workers who need the help. This is a potentially costly loss. I’ve never turned a blind eye to the downsides of global trade. I have long argued that not only is the benign view that trade is all upside wrong—there are people and places here who’ve been lastingly hurt by our persistent trade deficits in manufactured goods—but that the complacency of elites paved the way for a faux populist like Trump. History is clear on this point: a reliable way to fuel nationalistic, insular politics of the type exemplified by these tariffs is to ignore the downsides of disruptive economic change.All of which is to say I don’t have a knee jerk, negative response to interventions in this space that many of my colleagues immediately label as crass, destructive protectionism. It’s just that these tariffs and their phony national security rationale won’t come close to helping most workers displaced by imbalanced trade. They won’t lead to investments in new, potentially competitive industries, like green battery production or other renewable technologies. They won’t create significant job opportunities in places that have been left behind, even at our current low unemployment . They won’t provide the apprenticeship, earn-while-you-learn program needed to train a displaced coal miner to be an MRI technician. They won’t roll back the wasteful, regressive tax cuts that robbed the Treasury of the resources to invest in public goods, from infrastructure to human capital.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The good news is that we finally have an administration willing to try new and different ways to help those hurt by trade. The bad news is that it’s the Trump administration, led by a president that knows a lot about speaking directly to what ails working class Americans, but nothing about what to do to really help them."},
 {'title': 'Corporate America Has a Big Blind Spot on Institutional Racism',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Two amazing things happened on Tuesday. Roseanne Barr called former Obama adviser, and woman of color, Valerie Jarrett an “Ape,” apologized for the remark, left Twitter, and then had her show canceled by ABC. At the same time, Starbucks shut down some 8,000 U.S. stores in an effort to train their management staff and employees around the issues of diversity and inclusion. The remarkably swift move by one major network, and the altogether unprecedented move by one of the world’s biggest chains, have been met with great receptivity in some corners, and with some trepidation in others. Corporate trainers, like myself, know that dealing with the issues of race and racism, are complex, layered, and cannot be addressed in one day.But what remains clearer from both instances is that the election of President Trump in 2016 seems to have ushered in a new era of racism, racial slurs, and openly hostile behavior toward people of color, immigrants, and women. It is permeating our institutions, from the local coffee shops to the primetime shows.I want to be clear, I am not saying the president of the United States is a racist. He may or may not be. What I am saying is that his words have unequivocally shown that he views women and people of color through a very limited, stereotypical and archaic lens. He has trouble calling out racist behavior when it happens, like in Charlottesville last summer, saying there were “good people on both sides.” And he seems drawn to those figures who share those stereotypical and archaic lenses. Two months before Roseanne lost her show, Trump praised her ratings, even though it was clear back then that she ascribed to some truly questionable social views.Let’s face it, President Trump grew up in an America of the 1950s where segregation was legal, where women were groomed to be moms and housewives, where there were few elected officials of color, and where white men ran every major corporation, newsroom, university, and industry sector. Unfortunately, little has changed since Trump’s America of the 1950s and 1960s and we’re now being confronted with that lack of progress. Yes, we had a black President. Yes, we nominated a woman to run for president. But when you look at the present day, only 32 white women head Fortune 500 companies (or 6.4 percent). Three black men, one Latina, and no black women head corporations. The bottom line, Corporate America is still overwhelmingly white and male. And if you don’t think inclusion matters, consider this: both ABC and Starbucks have powerful black women executives—Rosalind Brewer is the COO of Starbucks and Channing Dungey the president of ABC Entertainment Group—in the room at the top. Corporations, like any other institution in America, are not immune from the effects of a nation built on systemic racial supremacy. Many companies, like American Airlines, Uber, Google, United, have fallen prey to major eruptions over race or gender discrimination in the past few years. (And those are just the ones we know about.) But the problem is not just one of “unconscious bias” — being unaware of racial insensitivities—but of “conscious bias”—knowing, as Roseanne surely did, that what one is doing is racially provocative.This is seen when white restaurant managers, store owners, or everyday citizens and neighbors call the police on suspicious black people, or on black people playing music too loudly. It is seen in the fear black people have of being stopped by the police for a routine traffic stop; or when we walk into a mall. There are restaurants in 2018 where black people can be locked out or assaulted over a dispute over plastic cutlery.Changing individual people’s perceptions is a painstaking effort. For corporations to truly change their culture, however, they need to get serious about the three “R’s”— Recruitment, Retention, Respect. Just recruiting people of color or women out of college is not good enough if you cannot retain and then advance them higher. The respect part is crucial because companies like Starbucks, which pride themselves on diversity, clearly did not filter that message down to their management ranks at the local stores until it was too late.Holding a day of management training or making a high-profile firing are steps in the right direction. But unless they are complimented by these additional actions it will be just a bandaid.

We have been since 1619 when the first African slaves arrived at Jamestown, Virginia. Many of our founding fathers, like Jefferson (who, at once, wrote that he abhorred slavery and owned them) believed that if blacks were ever freed, they would not live peacefully in America because of all the wrongs done to them. I think history has proven them part right, and part wrong. The reality is that white citizens live a very different reality than do black ones, and people of color. It’s white men who remain in charge and who are asked to see the value in being mentors, sponsors, and supporters of the advancement of people of color within their ranks. It is white men who must decide that having a ZERO tolerance policy of racist acts, racist statements, or racist conduct makes both moral and business sense. Tuesday saw some progress. But more dramatic changes, systemic changes, remain desperately needed."},
 {'title': 'If Anyone Can Be America’s First Black Woman Governor, It’s Stacey Abrams',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "You might be surprised to discover that many political scientists just don’t have the stomach for politics. Many of us are far more comfortable with theories and hypotheses than with delving into actual realities in communities, neighborhoods, cities, and politics in action. I confess that although I absolutely love the world of politics, campaigning, and elections, I had become a bit jaded after the 2016 presidential election. And then came Stacey Abrams, the woman vying to become Georgia’s next governor, and the first black female governor in the history of the United States.You might laugh—an African American woman governor of a red Southern state. But a look at how she’s made it this far shows that neither she nor her candidacy should be underestimated. Abrams has consistently beaten the odds and exceeded expectations in various stages throughout her life, the Georgia governor’s race is no different. Abrams, 44, moved to Atlanta with her minister parents as a teenager and was the first African American female valedictorian of her high school. Back then, she was hired as a typist for a congressional campaign; her edits were so good they made her a speechwriter. After becoming a Truman scholar and getting her law degree at Yale, Abrams was elected to the Georgia state House in 2006, and began serving as House Democratic Leader in 2011. She’s been a trailblazer and visionary rolled into one. When she saw that 800,000 people of color in Georgia were not registered to vote, she launched the New Georgia Project, registering over 200,000 Georgians in just two years. When she noticed there was a dearth of businesses run by women and people of color, she and a friend launched the NOW Account, a program to help small businesses grow and spur innovation in the aftermath of the 2008 recession, creating and maintaining over 2,000 jobs from over 350 small businesses in Georgia.“If her race and gender were white and male, there would be no question that Abrams would be handpicked and anointed as the future of the Democratic Party.”Most impressive has been her work pertaining to criminal justice reform. She helped pass changes to reduce sentences for non-violent offenders, shift Georgia’s policies on private probation, improve the parole system, adopt a new juvenile justice code, and obtain eligibility for vocational licenses for ex-offenders. Part of her passion for criminal justice reform stems from her brother’s struggles and interactions with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and the criminal justice system. These efforts are also informed by her parents and siblings’ ongoing financial and emotional support for a family member who has been involved in the criminal justice system. Her credentials are solid. So: Can she win? Can she win as a Democrat in a red state? Is there a path for victory for a black woman to lead a Southern state?I argue that a path is possible. Her primary opponent is a white female largely self-funded former state legislator who also shares the same first name. Stacey Evans has the money, but does not have the grassroots foundation. Even with a large number of Georgia primary voters still undecided, most polls show Abrams with a sizeable lead over Evans in the May 22 primary. However, many voters are mindful of the power of the Bradley effect, that is, what happened when Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ran for governor and discovered the discrepancy between opinion polls and the election outcome—that is, white voters saying they will vote for the black candidate but not doing so at the polls. The most significant case Evans has been able to make to some voters is that she is the more electable nominee against the presumed Republican candidate, the current Lt. Governor Casey Cagle. Abrams has had to convince voters that her vision, leadership style, and past legislative successes will reach the hearts and minds of voters across Georgia, despite being a black woman. If Abrams is victorious on May 22, she will likely face an opponent with a near perfect grade from the NRA as compared to her proud F-rating. In an era of increased gun violence, social issues that once seemed clearly partisan and uncomplicated are being brought to the fore and thrusting voters to specify and even rank their policy preferences and concerns. Most voters look at Georgia and see a bright red state. However, when we look a bit closer, Georgia emerges as a purple-ish state, and one that in this particular national political climate may be poised to turn blue. Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just five points in the state. The supply of affordable housing, along with corporate job creation and eastward migration after Hurricane Katrina, has bolstered the black middle class in Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs. In addition to this growth, the retirements and subsequent reverse migration of many black middle class Baby Boomers back to various counties in Georgia has created a new and robust voting bloc. I care about this race because it’s an opportunity to be a part of history with an abundantly qualified candidate. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Shirley Chisholm being elected to Congress. She began as a member of the New York legislature and served two terms before running for Congress. Similar to Chisholm, Barbara Jordan was the second African American woman elected to Congress in 1972, but the first from the South.

But notice, they were members of Congress. In the history of the United States, there have only been two elected black female senators (Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois and Kamala Harris of California), and zero black female elected governors. Abrams has a unique opportunity to become the first black female governor in U.S. history. Abrams and her team have built an extensive grass roots campaign strategy that extends across the 159 counties in Georgia. The Democratic primary is May 22 and it remains to be seen whether Georgians are ready to elect a black woman to lead. I do know that if her race and gender were white and male, there would be no question that Abrams would be handpicked and anointed as the future of the Democratic Party.The election of 2016 has shown us that race and racism are still embedded in the fabric of American political life. However, what the subsequent months have also shown is that this nation has the capacity to emerge from our sordid and divided past and bend toward the ideals of American democracy. This race may serve as the canary in the mine for the future of Democratic politics in the south and leading into 2020. "},
 {'title': 'Sanctioned Russian Bank Wooed D.C. With Glitzy Parties and High-Powered Lobbyists',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "By Carrie LevineLess than two months before a 2016 presidential election marked by Russian interference, senior State Department official Daniel Fried received an invitation to a private gala featuring an exclusive performance by the Bolshoi Ballet and a post-event reception.“Clearly your last meeting with Andrey Kostin made an impression!” said the email, sent by a former State Department official who now heads a trade association dedicated to business ties between the U.S. and Russia. “Please see attached a special invitation from him” for Fried and a guest to attend a VTB-sponsored gala at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.Who is Kostin? The chairman of VTB, a state-owned Russian bank operating under U.S. sanctions limiting its activities since 2014. VTB’s well-connected Washington lobbyists had previously brokered a meeting between the two men to discuss the sanctions. Fried, the State Department’s sanctions policy coordinator, declined. “I won’t be attending,” he replied to the trade association head. “We’re not interested in advancing their corporate reputation.” The previously unreported invitation, obtained by the Center for Public Integrity via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, was a striking overture in a discreet image-burnishing campaign by VTB that spanned the Obama and Trump administrations. Foreign campaigns to influence American officials are supposed to be transparent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a law requiring detailed disclosure of foreign influence efforts. But few believe FARA—passed in 1938 to combat Nazi propaganda—has been working well. It is riddled with exemptions. Enforcement is weak. Criminal penalties apply only to willful violations. And lobbyists’ filings are frequently late with few consequences, making available information less valuable to the public. For years, not many cared. But now, with accusations of foreign meddling gripping the nation’s capital, FARA is drawing intense scrutiny. VTB provides an illuminating example of what Americans learn—or don’t—under FARA. The bank’s hired lobbyists failed to disclose a series of June 2016 meetings with government officials on behalf of the sanctioned bank until months after U.S. law required them to. One firm, Sidley Austin, which boasts more than 2,000 lawyers worldwide, made the disclosure last year only after being contacted by the Center for Public Integrity about the meetings. And FARA administrators, citing a technical glitch, failed for three years to publicly release a document disclosing VTB had hired the U.S. Treasury Department’s former general counsel to advocate on its behalf. Such disclosure holes are “a glaring example” of “a broader pattern of noncompliance with FARA and underenforcement of FARA,” said Ben Freeman, director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy, a think tank, and author of a book on foreign influence.VTB said its work with lobbyists is “structured in a completely transparent way.” A spokeswoman for Sidley Austin said omitting the meetings was inadvertent and “promptly corrected when discovered.” Sidley Austin’s advocacy team includes a former Democratic congressman from Virginia, Rick Boucher. Also on VTB’s payroll: lobbyist Mike Manatos of Manatos & Manatos, who raised tens of thousands of dollars for the presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.VTB has so far paid Sidley Austin and lobbying firm Manatos & Manatos a combined $1.2 million since 2015 for lobbying on sanctions, according to disclosures filed with the Department of Justice. The U.S. Treasury Department nevertheless announced new sanctions against Kostin himself in April. VTB’s effort—a reaction to economic sanctions imposed on the bank by U.S. officials—coincided with escalating scrutiny of Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. The election interference in part prompted some members of Congress to propose legislation last Halloween to overhaul FARA. The Department of Justice has signaled a toughening approach to FARA, and in May, trumpeted a new guilty plea by an agent working for Pakistan. Congressional scrutiny of FARA has intensified. And last year, in what amounts to the highest-profile FARA prosecution in decades, Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, with FARA violations in connection with Manafort’s work in Ukraine. “Individuals who avoid disclosure undermine the purpose of the law,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said at a Senate Judiciary hearing last year on FARA oversight and attempts to influence U.S. elections. Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) has called the frequency of FARA violations and lobbyists who fail to register at all one of the “worst kept secrets” in Washington.VTB’s Fight BeginsThe United States put VTB and other Russian companies under sanctions in 2014 in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a peninsula claimed by Ukraine. The sanctions on Russian banks, including VTB, effectively limited access to capital and Western markets, though dealings with the bank aren’t totally barred. The Russian government owns a controlling interest in VTB—61 percent of the voting shares. VTB has a reputation of working closely with the Kremlin, though earlier this year, in an interview with The Independent, a British newspaper, Kostin called that “bullshit.”The Russian government gave VTB a $2.6 billion bailout in late 2014 and 2015, after Western nations hit the bank with sanctions. The bank has since rebounded, recently reporting record profits. But in April, the U.S. Treasury Department announced a new round of Russian sanctions. Included on the list: Kostin himself.U.S. sanctions sent VTB, like so many before it, to K Street. VTB’s press office, in a statement responding to questions from the Center for Public Integrity, said working with lobbyists is “a general business practice among major international companies.” “Our engagement with the lobbyists is structured in a completely transparent way” under “standard contracts that fully adhere to all the legal guidelines applicable to such agreements,” the VTB statement said. “Our focus is to educate U.S. policymakers and lawmakers about VTB, its scope of business and operations. We made a conscious decision not to ‘lobby’ for anything and our objective is to better inform decision makers in the U.S.”Upon VTB engaging Manatos & Manatos, the firm listed VTB’s New York City office address and registered effective April 2015 under the Lobbying Disclosure Act—a domestic lobbying disclosure regime that requires far less disclosure than FARA. Manatos & Manatos said it would lobby on government actions “that affect the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Russian-affiliated banks.” Manatos & Manatos didn’t respond to requests for comment. “I’ll have to check and get back to you. Thank you,” Manatos said when a Center for Public Integrity reporter called, before hanging up. He did not call back or respond to subsequent emails.Manatos & Manatos subsequently registered under FARA on behalf of VTB in May 2016. Sidley Austin registered under FARA from the beginning of its work with VTB. Lobbyists registering under FARA must file a series of documents within 10 days of agreeing to represent a new foreign principal, according to the law and Department of Justice regulations. For example, Boucher, who now heads the government strategies practice at Sidley Austin, and Michael Borden, a government strategies partner who was previously a senior counsel to the House Financial Services Committee, properly filed paperwork in June 2015 showing they would be representing VTB. The firm also filed a disclosure at the same time for lawyer George Madison, the former general counsel of the U.S. Treasury Department. But Sidley’s filing on behalf of Madison wasn’t made public by the FARA office until April 2018, when the firm wrote to the Department of Justice to flag the mistake, according to documents Sidley Austin provided to the Center for Public Integrity. Department of Justice spokesman Ian Prior said that because of a technical error with the department’s filing system, the form “never reached the FARA Unit for processing” and the situation “has been remedied.”Manatos & Manatos filed disclosures with the Department of Justice covering June 2016 to November 2016 and replied “no” to a question asking whether the firm had engaged in political activity. The firm did disclose it had “helped arrange for meetings with select U.S. policymakers.” It didn’t identify them. But in June 2017, six months after the initial disclosure was filed, Manatos & Manatos moved to correct the record. The firm filed a new report disclosing all the contacts and meetings constituting political activity, providing copies of emails and thank you notes from Kostin. Sidley Austin, for its part, amended its report in August 2017 to disclose its “political activity” in June 2016. “The following should be added,” the firm wrote, adding that Borden had actually met with “staff members from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, State Department Coordinator for Sanctions Policy Dan Fried, Rep. Eliot Engel and Rep. Jeb Hensarling to discuss the impact of U.S. sanctions on Russia institutions.” Sidley Austin’s Mullins confirmed the amended report was prompted by a call from the Center for Public Integrity last summer.Mullins said the retroactive filing was one of “two minor oversights” in the firm’s FARA filings. The other: the firm said it would also amend its disclosures, in response to questions from the Center for Public Integrity, to reflect a $2,700 campaign contribution Madison made in 2016 to Clinton. Lobbyists are required to publicly disclose campaign contributions on FARA filings.‘Soft Lobbying’By September 2016, Russian interference was a major issue in the presidential election. At the same time, VTB was preparing to host the October gala at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., “on the margins” of World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in the city.And Daniel Russell, the former State Department official who now heads the U.S.-Russia Business Council, which includes VTB among its members, was wooing Fried to the gala.Fried said he’s known Russell for years, but there was no chance he was going to accept the invite. He called it a “reasonable supposition” to assume he was on the guest list because of his official position. “I was not interested. Like, seriously?” Fried said. Fried said that sort of approach is designed to find officials who “looked like they could be courted or flattered or something. I don’t believe anyone in the U.S. government is susceptible to that kind of thing, but the Russians were going to keep pushing.”Fried wasn’t the only invitee. At least one other State Department official received an invitation.The U.S.-Russia Business Council is registered to lobby on its own behalf, regarding sanctions, under laws governing domestic lobbyists, not FARA.FARA—for all its exemptions and loopholes—contains extremely broad triggers, the law firm Covington & Burling wrote in a client advisory.The Center for Public Integrity asked Russell whether the U.S.-Russia Business Council had sought legal advice regarding any obligation to register under FARA in connection with the invitations, since they involved contacting government officials at Kostin’s request.Russell did not specifically address the question of legal advice. But in an emailed response, he stressed the trade association’s long history of supporting educational and cultural events in Russia and the U.S. “The performance was sponsored by VTB, which made available invitations for the U.S.-Russia Business Council,” he said. “The Council forwarded invitations to private and public sector individuals of its choice; the cover message for the invitations stated that VTB was the sponsor and that RSVPs should be directed to VTB directly.”Russell also said the trade association “conducts policy advocacy activities solely on behalf of U.S. companies.”Russell did not respond to follow-up questions about the emails and VTB did not directly respond to a question from the Center for Public Integrity asking whether Russell and the trade association extended the gala invitations to Fried and others at Kostin’s request.The event was a showcase for the sanctioned bank. Kostin spoke, and VTB’s logo was projected onto the curtain of the highest-profile theater venue in the nation’s capital. Among the guests who eventually turned up for the 2016 gala and reception: Alex Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star from Russia whose relationship with the Kremlin has drawn attention. Fried said he doesn’t believe anyone from the State Department would have seriously considered attending. A brief report in Politico said congressional aides were there, but didn’t name them. Michael Carpenter, a former U.S. National Security Council director for Russia who has also worked in the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department, said he met with companies regarding sanctions while a government official, but such “soft lobbying” on behalf of Russian interests “makes me nauseous.” “If I did receive an invitation like that I would have never gone,” Carpenter, who is now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, said of the gala. The invitations to American officials on behalf of VTB show the weakness of the law governing foreign lobbyists, he said. Under FARA, “the information is poorly disseminated and the enforcement of failure to register or failure to disclose is very lax,” Carpenter said.Indeed, a 2016 audit of enforcement and administration of FARA by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General found high percentages of late disclosure filings. Officials with the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, who are responsible for enforcing the law, need to improve “controls and oversight of FARA registrations” and better enforce “the complete and timely submission of required documentation,” the auditors wrote. The Department of Justice did not make someone available for an interview about FARA enforcement for this story. But in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2017, Department of Justice Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey said “the high burden of proving willfulness, difficulties in proving ‘direction or control’ by a foreign principal, and exemptions available under the statute make criminal prosecution for FARA violations challenging.” Contacts With State DepartmentIn early October 2016, Kostin was back in town, hosting the Bolshoi gala—and meeting officials at the State Department. This time, the requests came from Sidley Austin’s Borden, who had emailed the State Department officials in September and October to set up meetings for Kostin. State Department talking points prepared for Sandra Oudkirk, the director of the office of sanctions policy and implementation at the State Department—labeled “sensitive but unclassified”—once again stress the need for implementation of the Minsk agreements. “There are no changes on the horizon for our sanctions policy,” read the talking points, which were created for a meeting with Kostin, possibly the meeting that took place on Oct. 6, 2016. Later in October, Kostin was back in Russia, sitting on a stage next to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the keynote speaker at an annual investment forum hosted by VTB.Identifying himself as a former congressman and a partner at Sidley Austin, Boucher stood up in the front row and asked a question, according to a transcript of the event translated into English and posted on the Kremlin’s website. “I’m concerned about the apparently deteriorating quality of the relationship between the United States and Russia,” Boucher began, calling it a “leading issue in our presidential campaign.” He went on to ask about implementation of the Minsk accords.“We are not the ones who are sabotaging the Minsk Agreements,” Putin said, pointing to actions others, such as Ukrainian officials, would have to take. “And now I will answer the main question. What should be done to normalise the situation?” he said. “The parties should acts as partners and take into account each other’s interests. We are ready for this.”After the election, as reporters and investigators increasingly focused on any interaction between Trump and Russia, the New York Times reported that in a 2015 email, Trump associate Felix Sater said Kostin and VTB had agreed to finance a Trump project in Moscow. The project was never built. Kostin told the New York Times that the bank had no dealings with Sater and had never agreed to finance the project, calling it “wrong information” and “fake news.” Around the same time, FARA filings and State Department emails released to the Center for Public Integrity show Kostin, Swigart, Boucher, Borden, Madison and Manatos had another meeting at the State Department, again with Oudkirk.Then, in April, the Treasury Department released new sanctions on a list of Russian officials in response to Russian government actions in Ukraine and Syria, as well as “attempting to subvert Western democracies, and malicious cyber activities.” Kostin’s name was on the list. The sanctions against him mean no American can engage in financial dealings with him or provide services to him. U.S. lobbyists may continue to represent the bank, though not under Kostin’s direction, said Erich Ferrari, a lawyer specializing in sanctions. “VTB Group continues to work with the lobbyists solely to meet our business objectives in the region,” VTB’s statement to the Center for Public Integrity said.Sidley Austin’s Mullins said the firm “immediately took steps to comply with its legal obligations once Mr. Kostin was added to the sanctions list.” Manatos did not respond to a query about that firm’s response to the new sanctions against Kostin.As for Kostin himself, in an interview with CNN Money shortly after the sanctions were announced, he was asked whether there was a chance other countries would also target him. Kostin said he isn’t doing anything wrong. “It’s not up to me,” he said, “to influence this process.” "},

All across northern France there are the graves of men, including many thousands of Americans, who died in a foreign land in the course of two world wars.Sometimes there are vast, carefully manicured cemeteries like the one at Colleville-sur-Mer in Normandy, with more than 9,000 graves of Americans who died during and after the D-Day landings in 1944. More often, if you drive through the rolling, verdant farmlands between the English Channel and the Belgian border, there are clusters of headstones on small plots on the fringe of a village or a hamlet, marking the location of a quick and bloody skirmish, a sudden, intense firefight. The graves are immaculately tended, the flowers always fresh.In the hamlet of Cantigny, too small to appear on most maps, there is a monument inscribed: “Erected by the United States of America to commemorate the first attack by an American Division in the World War.”This is where it all began, a century ago, the first use of American military power abroad, fighting with allies in the cause of freedom.Early on May 28, 1918, units of the U.S. Army’s First Division were committed to retake Cantigny from the Germans who occupied it.The commanders of the French and British armies were unsure how well the Americans would fight. In terms of battle experience they had none. They lacked essential equipment. Their allies had to back them up with the two newest weapons of war, airplanes and tanks, which they lacked.Before the Americans could attack, the ground between them and the German positions had to be blasted by a rolling artillery barrage. The American infantry would emerge from their trenches and advance in pace with the shells raining down ahead of them. Hopefully their supporting artillery would eliminate the German artillery before it found them.This was very late in the war. The British and French had been locked into a largely static and continually murderous stalemate with the German armies, producing millions of casualties on both sides. In all of military history there had never been such a seemingly senseless demonstration of mutual destruction to no advantage of either side.For at least two years before it entered the war in 1917 America had been sharply divided about whether, against all the country’s isolationist instincts, it should – or even could – become engaged in this conflict. In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson had been re-elected with a margin of only 23 electoral votes – decisively helped by left-wing factions who believed he would keep the country out of the war.But on the evening of April 2, 1917, Wilson went before a joint session of Congress and told them “It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, but the right is more precious than peace” and America would go to war “for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government, for the rights and liberties of small nations…and to make the world itself at last free.”Wilson was therefore the first occupant of the White House to accept the responsibility of sending large numbers of the nation’s youngest and brightest to fight in a foreign field. But, just as America’s armed forces were ill-equipped for this new form of total war, they were also far short of the men required to wage such a war.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The hamlet – by then little more than pulverized stone and timber – was taken in 30 minutes. Among the young officers leading the attack were Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and the future World War II army chief of staff and statesman, George C. Marshall. In support the French had used 368 heavy artillery pieces, mortars, flamethrowers and, crucially, tanks used to wipe out the German machine gun positions. Now the crucial test was could the Americans withstand the inevitable German counter-attack?On the first day they repulsed three counter-attacks, and more over the following days until the position was secured. Their losses, though, were heavy: 1,603 casualties including 199 killed. Of the enemy, 1,400 were killed or wounded, and 250 were taken prisoner. The Allied front line was advanced by a mile.In the bigger picture of the war it was an insignificant engagement. Symbolically it was hugely portentous. America was now committed to become an international war power.But between the first and second world wars the U.S. armed forces were neither equipped nor manned to fight a war without conscription. It was a given that if other wars came the draft would have to resume. In World War II and the Korean War enforced recruitment by draft was never seriously questioned, but all that changed with the Vietnam War—as a result of a widespread and articulate anti-war movement the questioned the whole validity of the policies behind it.The single most erudite and eloquent attack on the war was made by a young and decorated Vietnam vet, and future senator, John Kerry, in testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April 1971—four years before Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese.The lines most often quoted from Kerry’s testimony, because of their simple power, are “…how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?”But a little later he said, with a more direct accusation: “We are also here to ask, and we are here to ask vehemently, where are the leaders of our country? Where is the leadership? We are here to ask where are McNamara, Rostow, Bundy, Gilpatric, and so many others…these are commanders who have deserted their troops, and there is no more serious crime in the law of war.”They were the founding members of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations’ foreign and defense policy brain bank. To justify war they had peddled a classic Cold War anti-communist dogma, the domino theory: that unless the communists in Vietnam were stopped the whole of south-east Asia would follow them to red perdition. “We are here to ask where are McNamara, Rostow, Bundy, Gilpatric, and so many others…these are commanders who have deserted their troops, and there is no more serious crime in the law of war.”— John Kerry to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 1971Vietnam, of course, eventually fell to the communists, but the other dominoes never followed.With the launching of the Iraq war by George W. Bush the same questions that Kerry raised were urgently asked again, and the same accusations made, of its neocon architects, from vice-president Dick Cheney to the “brains” behind the policy like Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, who purveyed two gigantic falsehoods – the presence in Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, and the certainty of a quick and relatively bloodless victory.They, too, have long since gone silent, having left a terrible legacy in blood and the manifold wounds of body and mind.And now Kerry’s cri de coeur on behalf of the victims of disastrous war doctrines leads us afresh directly to the man whose bellicosity is shaping Trump’s world view, national security advisor John Bolton. As Barack Obama’s secretary of state Kerry was the main architect and driver of the international team that negotiated the deal with Iran to stop its development of nuclear weapons, a deal that Bolton has always hated and is now in a position to destroy.Like all the war drummers before him, Bolton displays an astonishing historical and cultural illiteracy. In his case it is the reckless “see you in Tehran” war cry that seems to imply that Iran as a nation can be “taken out” like an annoying gang that is disrupting a neighborhood.Bolton wants regime change in Tehran. But Iran, unlike Iraq and Syria, is not an arbitrarily bordered gimcrack invention of western powers following World War I to oblige their own strategic interests. It is a combustible mixture of a theocracy, a highly educated secular democracy and a deeply corrupt police state, all framed within a history going back thousands of years that provides an immutable national identity and pride.A military attack on Iran would make the Iraq war seem like a minor sideshow and the consequences would spread far wider than the Middle East. It has been said of Bolton that Vietnam was the only war he didn’t like – if it meant that he served in it. Bolton served four years in the National Guard and then another two years in the Army Reserve, thereby avoiding the draft.In his Yale 25th reunion book he explained: “I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam lost.”And there you have it: Bolton is openly claiming the privilege of choosing which war he was ready to fight in, while actually fighting in none. Most people would think that that is enough to earn him his chicken hawk wings, along with Dick Cheney, who gamed the draft system to get no fewer than five deferments and avoided service.“I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. I considered the war in Vietnam lost.”— John Bolton, 2005Meanwhile our present commander-in-chief, although going to a military academy, was exempted medically from the draft on the basis of a supposed bone spur. In office Trump has shown no comprehension of the moral burden of committing men to battle. In a call meant to console the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who died in an ambush in Niger, he said that “at least he knew what he had signed up for.”What Sargent Johnson had actually signed up for was an operation that the Pentagon later admitted was incompetently planned and led. But, of course, Trump’s most unconscionable insult to those who have been sent to the killing fields was his dismissal of Senator John McCain as a war hero “because he was captured.” As if that were not enough, the White House failed to apologize when Kelly Sadler, a special assistant in the communications department, said McCain’s opposition to the nomination of Gina Haspel as CIA director “didn’t matter because he’s dying anyway.”On this Memorial Day it is John McCain who stands as the shining exemplar of sacrifices made by an American serviceman for his country – and for setting an almost impossibly high bar for the definition of what makes an American hero. The men who died one hundred years ago on an obscure battlefield in France did so to prove American valor. Those who now send others to make that point should first have demonstrated valor themselves. Leaders who have seen the hell of wars are usually a good deal more careful about going to war than those who have not.."},
 {'title': 'Each President Learns to Loathe His Special Prosecutor',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "To head off a 21st century Saturday night massacre, a bipartisan group of senators took the first step last week to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from White House interference.That’s a move that harks back to the last century, when President Nixon initiated the firings that are the signature move of the Watergate scandal after a deal fell through for a sympathetic third party to review the incriminating audio tapes he didn’t want to turn over to Congress. Pat Buchanan, then a top Nixon aide, told the Daily Beast in an email that Nixon had “no choice” but to remove the special prosecutor looking into Watergate, Archibald Cox, by firing Cox’s boss, Attorney General Elliot Richardson, after he refused to fire Cox. “Yom Kippur war was going on, Henry (Kissinger) was in Moscow. RN (Richard Nixon) told me in Oval Office, he could not be seen by (Russian President) Brezhnev as backing down to Elliot.” It was the Cold War, and national security offered a compelling rationale, but Nixon more likely acted more to save his own skin. “If I have to get down to a GS-7 at Justice” by firing every person with a higher pay-grade,”I’m going to fire him (Archibald Cox),” Nixon told Buchanan. \xa0No one questioned Nixon’s authority, and the White House shut down the special prosecutor’s office that night. “The whole thing was back up and running in a week,” says Buchanan, an indication that the investigation would not die, and that Nixon would be toast. Elected in November of 1976 on a post-Watergate “I’ll never lie to you” campaign, Jimmy Carter signed a collection of reforms in 1978 known as the Ethics in Government Act. The law allowed the Attorney General to recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate charges of misconduct in the executive branch, with a three-judge panel naming the prosecutor. “One of the great ironies is that the first person it ensnared was Hamilton Jordan,” the president’s newly named chief of staff, says Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s domestic issues advisor and author of a just published 900-page account of Carter’s White House years. According to Eizenstat, the bogus charge that Jordan had snorted cocaine at Studio 54 in New York originated with the notorious lawyer Roy Cohn, whose client owned the nightclub, and who sought a plea bargain by claiming he had something on Jordan. A grand jury voted unanimously in May 1980 that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegations. “It was a terrible time for Ham,” says Eizenstat. “It cost him a million dollars in legal fees, for which he was never reimbursed.” Similar charges of cocaine use against Carter’s campaign manager Tim Kraft were dropped in 1981, after sidelining Kraft from the 1980 campaign. The third special prosecutor triggered by the law was for Reagan Labor Secretary Ray Donovan, who faced allegations of connections to organized crime. He too was acquitted, famously asking: “Which office do I go to get my reputation back?”Authorized for just five years, the Special Prosecutor provisions of Carter’s Ethics in Government Act were set to expire in October 1983 with President Reagan in the White House. Reagan opposed the law but signed the re-authorization after Congress amended the law’s “hair trigger” so a single accusation could not set it off, and the Attorney General was given more latitude to decide whether further investigation was warranted. \xa0The wording was also changed from special prosecutor to a less loaded term, independent counsel. In another touch of irony, Reagan’s longtime friend and Attorney-General designate, Edwin Meese, was the first ensnared by the newly re-authorized law for allegedly improper ties with a defense contractor. The special counsel declined to prosecute. \xa0Seven independent counsels were triggered during Reagan’s two terms, including top aides Michael Deaver and Lyn Nofziger for lobbying activities after they left the White House that broached the limits of federal ethics laws. Nofziger maintained he was innocent “of any deliberate violations of law,” and his conviction was thrown out on appeal. A judge called Deaver’s offenses crimes of “circumstance and opportunity” unlikely to be repeated, giving him a suspended sentence and a $100,000 fine. The most controversial and expensive by far of the investigations under Reagan was the probe into the Iran-Contra affair, and the selling of arms to Iran in violation of U.S. Law. Appointed in December 1986, Lawrence Walsh was hailed as someone with the perfect political pedigree as a onetime federal judge and high-ranking official in Eisenhower’s Justice Department. But as his investigation stretched out over six years and only one man was sent to prison, a retired CIA officer who had arranged arms shipments to the Contras, Walsh became a pariah among the right and hemorrhaged political support.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Reagan called Walsh’s final report “a vehicle for baseless accusations that he could never have proven in court.” Reagan then reluctantly signed another five-year reauthorization of the law, even though he believed it was unconstitutional. It wasn’t. The Supreme Court upheld the law in 1988 in a 7-to-1 ruling.  Walsh’s investigation cost $48.5 million, and though he secured eleven convictions, many were overturned and George H.W. Bush, Reagan’s successor, pardoned six defendants on Christmas eve of 1992 after losing that year’s election to Bill Clinton. Among them was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, indicted on five felony counts, who was pardoned before he was even tried. Pat Buchanan, who had challenged Bush in the primaries, campaigned for him in the general election and remembers being on the trail in Alabama when word came down four days before the election about an additional one-count indictment of Weinberger for making a false statement. Buchanan believes the damaging news slowed Bush’s momentum in the same way James Comey’s revisiting Hillary Clinton’s emails hurt Clinton \xa0\xa0Walsh accused Bush, who had been vice president during Iran Contra, of withholding notes he had kept in a contemporaneous diary. Walsh closed his investigation an angry man, later writing, “What set Iran-contra apart from previous political scandals, was that a cover-up engineered in the White House of one president and completed by his successor prevented the rule of law being applied to perpetrators of criminal activity of constitutional dimension.” The independent counsel law had expired in December 1992 when Bill Clinton signed its reauthorization on July 1, 1994, calling it “a force for government integrity and public confidence.”First Lady Hillary Clinton had famously urged her husband to call for an independent counsel for Whitewater, a land deal that had gone awry, thinking that would wall off the burgeoning scandal and keep it from being a distraction to her husband’s presidency. In January of 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed special prosecutor Robert Fiske, who was succeeded by Kenneth Starr, who pursued the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and finally by Robert Ray, who wrapped things up in 2000. The Clintons were never charged with any crime but the drumbeat of scandal pursued them both in and out of office. Hillary Clinton had the dubious distinction of being the first First Lady to testify before a grand jury when she was subpoenaed in the Whitewater investigation. \xa0By mid-1998, there were seven separate investigations of Clinton administration officials, including Mike Espy, Clinton’s Secretary of Agriculture who’s currently running for the Senate in Mississippi. He was indicted in 1997 on 30 criminal charges of accepting improper gifts, including sports tickets, lodging and airfare. After a trial where more than 70 witnesses testified, he was acquitted of all charges. At least four other Cabinet officials had special counsels looking into alleged ethical lapses. Only one resulted in an indictment, and that was Henry Cisneros at HUD, who was found to have lied to the FBI about the size of payments he was making to his mistress and mother of one of his children, a revelation that led to his resignation. Bruce Babbitt at Interior, Ron Brown at Commerce, and former Labor Secretary Alexis Herman all escaped without being indicted, raising questions about whether the law was too broadly drawn and whether it was being used to weaponize political fights. By June 30, 1999, when the statute was up for re-authorization, it was allowed to quietly expire with bipartisan support. \xa0There was no outcry at the time and until Trump fired FBI Director James Comey a year ago, no particular awareness of the need to protect the independence and integrity of a special counsel. \xa0“Now we’re seeing what happens when you let it lapse,” says Eizenstat. Asked if he thought the Carter-era law could be revived, he replied, “Are you kidding?” "},
 {'title': 'Trump Doesn’t Care if CIA Nominee Gina Haspel Oversaw Torture. In Fact, He’s ‘Into It’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the CIA, has come under fire during her confirmation fight due to questions about the extent of her involvement in the George W. Bush-era torture program. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill, even some in Trump’s own party, have been openly skittish at the prospect of her ascension to the top spy post. Scores of civil liberties advocates and human rights groups have been more appalled than skittish. Haspel even considered yanking her own nomination amid the mounting scrutiny.One person isn’t buckling, however. The president has thrown his support both publicly and privately behind Haspel, despite the torture allegations. In fact, he considers them a draw. Over the past several days, the president has expressed as much to officials and others close to him, according to three people familiar with the discussions. One source, a White House official, said President Trump has leaned “into it” when the topic is brought up. Another source who spoke to Trump about the nomination told The Daily Beast that the president has said Haspel “could have gone [even] further” than what she has been accused of and it wouldn’t have fazed him.And she went far. Haspel oversaw the so-called black site in Thailand where the terror suspect Abd Al Rahim al-Nashiri was waterboarded, and according to a book by former top CIA lawyer John Rizzo, she “r[a]n the interrogation program.” (Rizzo, without explanation, later withdrew that account.) In November 2005 Haspel drafted a cable for her then-boss, clandestine-service chief Jose Rodriguez, ordering the destruction of videotapes showing evidence of brutal interrogation. Her defenders, and Trump administration officials, argue that everything she did was done in a legal framework at the time and routinely promote their docket of bipartisan support for her nomination. Her critics stress that she was a willing party to gross human rights violations, and that that should at the very least disqualify her from leading the U.S. intelligence service.On Friday, Haspel flirted with the idea of pulling her nomination because, sources say, she didn’t want to re-litigate the CIA’s past history and, in the process, damage the the agency’s image again. But the president, among others, talked her out of it, saying that she shouldn’t shy away from confronting her critics, according to a source familiar with their talk. The president, the source added, views Haspel as “a fighter.” And on Monday morning, Trump took to Twitter to underscore his feelings on the matter. “My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists,” the president tweeted. “Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!”Trump’s assessments of Haspel—that she was merely being “tough” on some folks—is an extension of his years-long public endorsement of U.S.-sanctioned torture, long after the CIA ditched the practice under intense political and legal pressure. “If America was under the threat of imminent attack, would Obama use torture or a kiss?” Trump tweeted mockingly in December 2014. Trump more succinctly summarized his philosophy on counterterrorism in an April 2013 tweet reading, “NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!”During the 2016 presidential race, Trump was emphatic about his desire to, if elected president, bring back torture in an even bigger way than Bush allowed. “Frankly, the waterboarding, if it was up to me, and if we changed the laws or had the laws, waterboarding would be fine,” Trump said in early 2016, referencing the method President Barack Obama banned in 2009. “I would do a lot more than waterboarding. You have to get the information from these people.”Some spooks were taken aback. “[I]gnoring if you can the immoral aspects of torture, if you do torture someone, you get nothing of value from them,” a former senior CIA operations officer told The Daily Beast at the time. “You get what they think you want. And if you take that information as gospel you are a fool.”As the Trump era got underway, the president retreated rhetorically on the issue. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump said that Defense Secretary James Mattis could “override” him when it came to whether the U.S. will revive the euphemistically branded methods of “enhanced interrogation.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.More than a year later, President Trump is gearing up for a confirmation campaign on behalf of a central figure in the Bush-era scandal over torturing terror suspects. But it’s not just Haspel’s association with enhanced interrogation techniques that drew him to her. According to several sources in and outside the administration, Haspel enjoys strong champions throughout the White House and in high level Trump orbits. In particular, former CIA chief Mike Pompeo has been a committed advocate, having felt immense gratitude to Haspel for her help in ingratiating him to staff at Langley when he started. Haspel, an officer of 30-plus years, helped diffuse the cynicism that many others in the building felt about the Trump administration when it first took office, two sources familiar with the nomination said. One of those sources suggested that Pompeo also wanted Haspel running the CIA in order to ensure that he had an ally in the post. Months prior to her nomination, it was rumored that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) would be a potential nominee. That could have resulted in competing power structures between Langley and Foggy Bottom, though a senior administration official cautioned that such talk was overblown, noting that Cotton and Pompeo are close friends from their days in the House of Representatives. Haspel also has earned kudos inside the White House for handling the presidential daily briefing, which, as one source familiar with the nomination noted, “can be a bear.”“She found herself down at the White House with some regularity for the PDB,” the source said. “I think overtime people thought she was solid and no nonsense and was trusted.” But what Haspel has in internal allies she lacks in public political support. White House aides say that they are confident they will secure the 50 votes needed to get confirmation. But they expect the margin to be close, perhaps closer than Pompeo’s own vote to take over state. The Central Intelligence Agency, for its part, has embarked on an unusual public relations and social media blitz to ardently defend and exculpate Haspel—and also to try to humanize her by selectively offering biographical details on the former undercover officer, including her encounter with Mother Teresa and her love of Johnny Cash."},
 {'title': 'GOP Lawmakers: Trump Still Deserves the Nobel Even After Summit Collapse',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump may have pulled out of the North Korean nuclear summit. But several lawmakers still either want to award him the Nobel Peace Prize for his overtures to Kim Jong Un or believe that the recognition will come in time. “Considering Barack Obama received the prize for simply having a pulse and then recklessly destabilizing the globe, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could keep a straight face while questioning if Trump deserves one,” Kelsey Knight, a spokesman for Rep. Jim Renacci, an Ohio Republican running for the Senate, said in a statement. “[Trump] has freed our hostages while North Korea destroyed their nuclear test site ahead of his visit. ISIS is collapsing and we’re closer to ending the Korean War than we’ve been since the 1950’s.”Critics have insisted that the argument that Trump deserves a Nobel for his attempts to broker a nuclear deal with Kim always rested more on an appreciation for Trump than an appreciation for the prize. Renacci’s commitment awarding the president even without the high-profile summit, seems likely to give those critics additional fodder. The idea that Trump deserves a Nobel first originated when the possibility of that summit seemed strong. In the letter sent on May 2 to the Nobel Committee (PDF), a group of House Republicans lauded the president for bringing North and South Korea together in an effort to end “the Korean War [and to] seek to reunify their countries[.]” Trump was also credited in starting “the process to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula” with “peace through strength policies” that brought North Korea “to the negotiating table.” At the time, those lawmakers were mocked and criticized for the premature celebration of the summit’s success. And, sure enough, things soon began to fall apart. Two weeks after the letter was sent, the North canceled their talks with the South in reaction to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. A few weeks later, the planned summit between North Korea and the U.S. was canceled with a letter from the president’s desk. Some of the lawmakers who initially wanted Trump to get the Nobel have remained committed to the idea even as they acknowledge that the award may not come as quickly.Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), one of the signatories, said the president should be “commended” for getting more done than “any other of our former presidents,” but that the Nobel would have to come after the talks.“One of the greatest attributes of President Trump is his willingness to walk away if the deal is bad for America. Just because it didn’t happen now, does not mean it will not happen in the future,” Rep. Norman said in a statement. “If and when it does happen, the President will deserve the Nobel Peace Prize and I’m proud of signing on to the recommendation and yes, it will remain.”Another signer, Rep. Steve King, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that the nomination was “paused... for a little while” in anticipation of what would happen with the talks.“We always knew that would take some months to unfold and I’m disappointed by this action that has taken place, but I don’t think this action is incorrect on this,” he said. “But I do give President Trump a lot of credit for opening up these negotiations, for being willing to accept the invitation that was offered to him to negotiate with Kim Jong Un.”Four presidents in U.S. history have been bestowed a Nobel Peace Prize. Theodore Roosevelt was awarded in 1906, when he “negotiated peace” and brought an end to the Russo-Japanese War. Woodrow Wilson won in 1919 for establishing the League of Nations, the precursor to the United Nations that the U.S. ended up not joining. Jimmy Carter was awarded his in 2002—after his presidency—for “decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts.”Barack Obama got the award in 2009 for “efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation”—a much criticized recognition since he had been in office for so short a period of time.

 {'title': 'GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy Defends Michael Cohen Raid: ‘Nothing to Do With Politics’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A top House Republican on Sunday defended the FBI raid on President Donald Trump’s longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen’s home and office last week, as the president continues to assail what he views as a breach of attorney-client privilege.Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, argued that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—who is overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and has come under heavy criticism from Trump allies—was right to authorize the raid, and that Mueller was just in referring the matter to prosecutors in New York.“I don’t know what Mueller was supposed to do other than what he did. When a prosecutor comes in contact with information or evidence of a crime, what are you supposed to do, other than refer to the appropriate jurisdiction?” Gowdy said on Fox News Sunday.Gowdy characterized the approval process for the raid as arduous and fair, adding that it was ultimately given the green light by a “neutral” judge “who has nothing to do with politics.”Gowdy, who announced recently that he would not seek re-election, has been one of the top GOP defenders of Mueller and his investigation into Russian election meddling and possible collusion between Trump associates and Russian operatives.“How this is Mueller’s fault just defies logic to me,” the South Carolina Republican added.Trump has called the Cohen raid which took place a week ago “disgraceful” and “an attack on our country in a true sense,” and on Sunday it was still on the president’s mind.“Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!” he said.The Justice Department revealed on Friday that Cohen has been under criminal investigation for months over potential “acts of concealment” and “fraud,” and federal prosecutors appeared to undercut Trump’s claim that his attorney-client privilege was violated. The department said the search warrants “indicate that Cohen is in fact performing little to no legal work.”Government lawyers sought to undercut claims of attorney-client privilege by mentioning Cohen’s $130,000 payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, just days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for what Daniels says was her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. In the court filing, the Justice Department said Trump “has publicly denied knowing that Cohen paid Clifford, and suggested to reporters that they had to ‘ask Michael’ about the payment.”Amid pressure from Trump allies to fire Rosenstein and Mueller, NBC News reported on Friday that Rosenstein, a Trump appointee who is in charge of the Mueller probe because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, was telling confidants that he was preparing to be axed.“As for Rod Rosenstein, I don’t see a basis for firing him and his handling of this probe,” Gowdy said.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'body': "I first started covering John Bolton in 2005. At the time, the United Nations was gearing up for its largest-ever meeting of heads of state to mark the organization’s 60th anniversary. The fete was to take place at the annual United Nations General Assembly that September, the focal point of which was a major package of reforms that had been painstakingly negotiated by countries prior to the summit.But weeks before presidents and prime ministers were to arrive to celebrate the successful signing of these reforms, John Bolton entered the picture. Bolton was granted a recess appointment by George W. Bush on Aug. 5, just as negotiations entered their final stages.The talks were\xa0immediately thrown into disarray.Bolton inserted hundreds of objections to a late draft of the agreement, creating new “red lines” for the United States where none had previously existed. His objections covered issues big and small—even on semantics. For example, he rejected the mere mention of a poverty-alleviation program called the Millennium Development Goals. He refused to budge from his maximalist position on this and every other edit he made to the document.At the time, he seemed to relish in the chaos that he had sown. During late-night press encounters, he would quip “All night, all right!” as if his goal was less to negotiate in good faith and more to just drag out the negotiations as a deadline loomed.Eventually, as I reported at the time, then-Secretary General Kofi Annan got so fed up with Bolton’s antics that he called then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and asked her to rein him in. She did. The reform packages passed at the eleventh hour. \xa0“In his memoir, he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest vitriol not for the representatives from Iran or Venezuela, but for his British counterpart, UK Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, whom he mercilessly pillories as an “EU Roid.””That incident presaged Bolton’s entire tenure at the U.N. The memoir he wrote of his experience at the U.N. was titled Surrender Is Not an Option. But Bolton’s time at the U.N. suggests that, to him, the natural give and take of diplomacy is akin to “surrender” and must be avoided at all costs. Understanding how he performed his job at the U.N. gives us big clues as to how he might approach the job as national security adviser, to which he has just been named. At the United Nations, Bolton demonstrated a profoundly zero-sum view of international relations. Other countries’ gains—no matter how insignificant—were ipso-facto America’s losses. This upended traditional alliances at the U.N. Typically, the United States and its European allies would band together in negotiations that reflected common interests. But Bolton was never willing to give an inch and accept the kinds of tradeoffs proposed by American allies. In his memoir, he reserves his harshest criticism and deepest vitriol not for the representatives from Iran or Venezuela, but for his British counterpart, U.K. Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, whom he mercilessly pillories as an “EU Roid.”The same dynamic also existed in his interagency battles. He steadfastly opposed a joint European-American initiative to negotiate with Iran, only to be overruled, again, by Condi Rice. Bolton also pushed back against efforts by the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs at State Department (known as the “EAP” bureau) to re-open negotiations with North Korea through a format called the Six Party Talks. In his memoir, Bolton derides American diplomats at the bureau as “EAPeasers.”Even before he became ambassador to the U.N., Bolton demonstrated a propensity to fixate on relatively minor foreign-policy issues and elevate them to major crisis points. In 2003, Bolton served as the undersecretary of State for arms control and international security. As he recounts in his memoir, he relished the opportunity to knee-cap the nascent International Criminal Court, which was set up to prosecute individuals for genocide and mass atrocities. \xa0President Bill Clinton, in his final days in office, signed the treaty that created this court. In Bolton’s early days as undersecretary of State, he declared that the United States had “unsigned” the treaty. He remarked that this was his happiest moment of his life as a public servant. But that was not enough. Bolton then embarked on an international campaign to secure bilateral agreements with as many countries as possible to theoretically grant Americans immunity from prosecution by the ICC. He would threaten these countries with a cut-off of military assistance should they not sign on to the agreement.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.One can argue about the propriety of the International Criminal Court. But his fixation on these immunity agreements created awkward and unnecessary friction with American allies. In 2003, for example, Latvia saw its military aid cut even as it was one of the very few countries in Europe to contribute its troops to George W. Bush’s war in Iraq. Latvia was a member of the coalition of the willing, but it was not willing to sign one of these agreements with the United States and so saw some military aid suspended, even as its troops were in Iraq.What does Bolton’s past suggest about how he will approach the job of national security adviser?Generally speaking, there are two kinds of national security advisers. There are those who emphasize their role as an honest broker between competing viewpoints and bureaucracies to judiciously oversee what is known as the “interagency process.” And there are those who are infighters themselves, who advocate for specific viewpoints and policies.I think we can safely guess what role John Bolton will fill. And that is the real danger. Bolton has famously called for pre-emptive war with both North Korea and Iran. He’s demonstrated a callous propensity to alienate allies. He enters into negotiations unwilling to give an inch.So this is the man who, as of April 9, will be whispering in Donald Trump’s ear and running National Security Council meetings. You’ve read about his extreme positions vis-à-vis North Korea and Iran. And now you’ve read that he enjoys alienating allies and thinks diplomacy is appeasement. So yep—as bad as you think."},
 {'title': 'How Corey Lewandowski ‘F*cked Over’ a David Petraeus-Linked Socialite to Become the Polish Arms Industry’s Man in D.C.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Corey Lewandowski, President Donald Trump’s informal adviser and fired campaign chief, quietly facilitated a highly lucrative deal between Poland’s top military contractors and one of the most elite lobbying shops in Washington, D.C., The Daily Beast has learned. In the process, Lewandowski managed to spurn socialite Jill Kelley, a one-time associate of the U.S.’ top military official and a central figure in the 2012 sex scandal that brought down retired general David Petraeus.The story, which was relayed to The Daily Beast by four sources familiar with the developments, is a strange chapter in the former Trump campaign manager’s career—a career that now finds Lewandowski consorting with a hub of lobbyists at the periphery of President Trump’s political circle—including some who work out of his Washington, D.C., home. It’s also a cartoonishly Washington tale, involving backstabbing in the city’s notorious influence industry, a glamorous socialite who was at the center of a historic sex scandal, and political operatives who arrived in D.C. pledging to drain the swamp, only to end up pocketing large sums in exchange for brokering multibillion-dollar weapons deals.Lewandowski did not directly respond to multiple requests for comment. However, on Thursday morning, his attorney Peter Chavkin conveyed to The Daily Beast a message from his client. “Mr. Lewandowski never met with or spoke to anyone” who worked at the defense contractor at the center of his dust-up with Kelley, Lewandowski stated, in the third person. Lewandowski, conspicuously, would not answer additional questions regarding any other Polish contacts that he may have had in pursuit of the lobbying deal.The origins of the lobbying deal began in 2017, as Poland warily eyed increased Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and began looking to secure U.S.-made missiles for its domestic air defense systems. The Polish government and its state-owned arms contractor, Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa (PGZ), sought assistance in Washington pertaining to Poland’s Wisla and Homar missile defense programs. Known in English as the Polish Armaments Group, PGZ is a conglomerate of 60 Polish defense companies.In the spring of 2017, Kelley began telling associates that she would leverage a contact at the Polish Embassy to secure a lucrative business deal with the country’s government. Kelley enjoys strong, and well-documented, contacts in the U.S. defense community. Her relationships played heavily into her role in the scandal that brought down Petraeus and embroiled high-level military officials in tabloid intrigue involving the retired general’s one-time mistress, Paula Broadwell. Kelley also has served as a ceremonial diplomatic liaison to James Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general and currently the secretary of defense, which would have made her an appealing voice in Washington for Poland’s arms industry.PGZ did not respond to questions about Kelley and its broader D.C. lobbying footprint. But according to two sources familiar with Kelley’s conversations with associates, she said one of her contacts worked as a military attaché in Poland’s embassy in Washington.“Jill Kelley is someone who has served her country in a number of capacities… [and] she has gained a number of very high-level contacts [with whom] she in the last year has chosen to begin discussions through her firm,” Brett Bruen, her representative, told The Daily Beast. “And while her work is still very much in the early stages, I think it is clear there are a number of very senior folks who seek her counsel and who are interested in her support. I will say to date she has not engaged in any paid work on behalf of a sovereign nation. She has done what she has done for many years, which is connect people.”It’s not entirely clear why Kelley turned to Lewandowski for help on the matter. Though part of the reason, a source with direct knowledge says, is that Lewandowski was one of the marquee names within the Trump orbit—a world in which few of the more established D.C. power brokers enjoyed strong inroads.When Kelley and Lewandowski first began discussing the deal, it was months into the Trump presidency. Lewandowski had already carved out a niche for himself as someone with personal access to the president for potential clients of Avenue Strategies, the lobbying firm he unveiled days after Trump’s inauguration. Four months after starting that firm, he resigned from it, reportedly over differences with his co-founder, fellow former Trump campaign hand Barry Bennett. He went on to start his own firm, Lewandowski Strategic Advisors, which provides political intelligence but does not officially lobby policymakers on behalf of its clients.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Kelley began telling associates in Washington last year that she had introduced Lewandowski to her Polish contacts and that they would be collaborating on a big initiative, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. Lewandowski apparently had other plans. He had already been in touch with another D.C. lobbying giant regarding one of its foreign government clients. In a July 2017 email to Lewandowski, reviewed by The Daily Beast, Ed Rogers, the veteran Republican operative and chairman of the firm BGR Group, inquired about Lewandowski’s contacts with the Azerbaijani ambassador to the U.S., whom BGR had represented since March. “Corey, we’re [sic] you able to talk to the Azerbaijan ambassador?” Rogers asked. “Call and let’s catch up for 15 minutes.” Politico later reported that Lewandowski had promised the ambassador, Elin Suleymanov, a personal sit-down with Trump. At the time, Lewandowski denied doing any “foreign work.”The relationship between Rogers and Lewandowski didn’t end with Azerbaijan. According to sources familiar with their interactions, the two grew closer as the Trump presidency progressed, and talked about potential collaborations.But by the end of 2017, Kelley had been cut out of the PGZ deal. As she waited to hear from Lewandowski on their plans for Poland, she was taken aback when she started hearing through professional cliques and general gossip that BGR, which previously represented the Polish Embassy in Washington, had swooped in on the deal. It inked a $70,000-per-month contract with PGZ on Oct. 25 (PDF), weeks before Kelley hosted a party at the Trump Hotel in Washington. Kelley and her co-host had listed Lewandowski as a likely attendee on invitations for that party. It’s not clear whether Kelley knew at the time that she had lost out on a major business opportunity thanks to the former Trump campaign manager. BGR’s contract with the company first popped up on the Justice Department’s registry of foreign agents less than two weeks after Kelley’s party.Once enthused at the prospect of working with Lewandowski, Kelley was cut out of a big-money foreign lobbying deal in which she had initially enlisted Lewandowski’s assistance. As one source familiar with the situation bluntly characterized it, Lewandowski “fucked over” Kelley in the deal. Three knowledgeable sources said that Lewandowski was instrumental in PGZ’s decision to sign with BGR instead of working with Kelley. Rogers did not respond to messages from The Daily Beast on Thursday as of press time. But the extent of his ties to Lewandowski were underscored by the email he sent, on which he CC’d another Trump campaign alumnus, Mike Rubino, a former lobbyist at Avenue who left to start the firm Turnberry Solutions, which lists as its address the Capitol Hill house that Lewandowski rents from the conservative nonprofit group Citizens United. Less than two months after BGR landed PGZ as a client, the firm signed a subcontractor on the account: Jason Osborne, a former Avenue lobbyist and, along with Rubino, a co-founder of Turnberry (PDF). Two weeks later, Osborne also registered to lobby for the Azerbaijani Embassy on BGR’s behalf (PDF).Osborne is another former senior Trump campaign adviser who remains close to Lewandowski and operates out of his rented home. Osborne also did not respond to questions about his role.BGR spokesman Loren Monroe declined to comment on PGZ work or any collaboration with Lewandowski, saying only that foreign agent paperwork on file with the Department of Justice “speaks for itself.”According to its PGZ contract, BGR is assisting the company with issues related to its Wisla and Homar missile defense programs. In March, just a few months after it signed the contract, Poland and the U.S. reached a landmark $4.75 billion arms procurement deal to beef up those missile systems. “Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa,” the company proudly announced, “will carry out many tasks in this project.”As part of the deal, PGZ will beef up the Wisla system with a pair of Patriot missile batteries purchased from U.S. defense giant Raytheon. As it happens, Raytheon is also a BGR client. "},

  'body': "In Donald Trump’s America, there really are two Americas.In one, America’s intelligence community caught wind of the fact that Russia was attempting to influence the various inexperienced and sketchy members of the Trump campaign, and sought to investigate this possibly dangerous behavior, using various methods at their disposal, including confidential informants on the inside. \xa0In the other America—and make no mistake, there are tens of millions living in this alternative universe—the Obama administration sought to wiretap and spy on the Trump campaign for completely nefarious reasons. They were out to get him from day one.There are several problems with this second option. First, of course, you have to believe that the intelligence community is wholly corrupt and utterly politicized—that there was a conspiracy (at least, at the top) to stop Trump from becoming president. If this was their goal, they failed miserably by helping him win. Or maybe you believe the “deep state” assumed Clinton would win without their help, but are now working in overdrive to coordinate a “deep-state coup” to remove him. Either way, this requires a conspiratorial mind.This brings us to the latest development. On Sunday, President Trump tweeted: “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes—and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!”Within hours, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein responded with a statement, saying, “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.”Some see this as caving to Trump’s demands, but I see it as incredibly shrewd. Rosenstein reaffirmed that he (not Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has recused himself from the Russia investigation) is in charge of this. Moreover, it establishes that Trump’s tweets are official statements. And lastly, of course, Rosenstein framed it exactly right as he handed the investigation off to the inspector general to investigate: The question is if anyone infiltrated or surveiled a campaign for “inappropriate purposes.”For those who don’t appreciate the seriousness of what Trump did on Sunday, one knowledgeable insider predicted that Rosenstein and FBI Director Chris Wray would resign before complying with Trump’s demand for a DOJ investigation.The other day, I had breakfast with a Russian opposition leader at the Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington (having watched too many episodes of The Americans, I wondered if we were being watched or, at the very least, if I might end up on some report filed that day in Moscow). My new friend is worried that America might be headed toward Putinism, but is also cautiously optimistic that Trump will serve as a sort of “stress test” that helps us fix any holes in our system. In short, he sees that Trump has the same authoritarian tendencies as Putin, but is relieved that our institutions are (mostly) working to contain him.The scary thing is that these institutions rest on the shoulders of men and women. If Sessions had resigned (when I wrongly said he should), these institutions would have been weakened. The same could be said for Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, and many others who represent the law enforcement community. Which brings me to my final point. It seems high time for the institution of Congress to step up. Make no mistake, what Trump said on Sunday was a big deal. Imagine, for a second, that this was a Democratic president ordering a Democratic attorney general to investigate the last Republican administration. Imagine any president making this instruction to any AG. It's a step beyond where we've been, but it is consistent with Trump’s M.O., which is to accuse others of the thing he has been accused of doing.Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should make it clear that they view Trump’s tweet as having crossed the line. Likewise, as chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. Trey Gowdy (who, like Ryan, is choosing to step away from the fight—which means he has little to lose) should publicly speak out on this.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Congress: We Can’t Stop Trump From Killing the Iran Deal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Key lawmakers are predicting that President Donald Trump will pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal later this spring. And although there is an appetite on Capitol Hill and within Trump’s own national security team to save the accord, members of Congress say they lack the immediate legislative options to save it from Trump’s axe.The president’s antipathy toward the deal struck by his predecessor is well established, and he has privately vented about a law that requires him to certify every few months that Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the deal.The next deadline to waive nuclear-related sanctions is May 12. And Trump has hinted, if not outwardly threatened, that he will use that moment to effectively pull the U.S. out of the agreement unless European allies agree to stricter terms. Lawmakers may be able to avoid that outcome if they were to pass legislation scrapping the certification requirements. But Democrats seem unwilling to tangle with those requirements as talks about enhancing the deal continue. And Republicans believe that the threat of leaving the deal entirely is needed in order to move European leaders during the negotiations.“There will be no congressional action until there’s a framework [agreed to with the Europeans],” Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of the foreign relations panel, told The Daily Beast. “We’ve let the White House know clearly that the onus is on them to negotiate a framework. If they get a framework done, then we’ll look at domestic language.”Corker isn’t optimistic that such a framework will ever come together. While he believes the White House and the Europeans can agree on new, stricter restrictions when it comes to Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missiles and the frequency of nuclear inspections, the administration’s biggest qualm with the agreement—the so-called “sunset” provisions which allow some limitations on Tehran’s nuclear program to expire—isn’t likely to be re-evaluated.The retiring senator predicted that the European partners—consisting of France, Germany and the United Kingdom—could eventually give up major concessions and move closer to the Trump administration’s position on the deal as the deadline approaches. If that comes together, he reasoned, it could end up saving the Iran accord and allow Congress to change the law requiring presidential certifications every few months. Corker and his counterparts were working on a framework recently that would have moved the certification requirement from 90 days to 180 days.Certification requirements were not part of the initial nuclear accord. Indeed, they were put into place later as lawmakers in the House and Senate sought to force then-President Barack Obama and any future president to essentially re-affirm their support for the agreement a handful of times per year. The resulting Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), helmed by Corker, passed overwhelmingly in 2015. Once Trump took office, however, the law took on a new meaning. Instead of forcing the president to stand by the nuclear accord, it became a pressure point for Trump to pull out of the deal altogether. Trump’s national security team, which has been wary of abandoning the deal, has since encouraged lawmakers to scrap the certification provision. Other foreign policy observers believe that eliminating those requirements would allow the U.S. to quietly remain within the deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and give additional peace of mind to the deal’s other partners.“The most essential thing for stability in the nuclear agreement is eliminating the waivers in congressional legislation that cause drama every three to four months with the president,” said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for New American Security, and a former aide to John Kerry at the State Department. “Democrats and the Europeans want this to be the last time we have this drama, which you only do by getting rid of the waivers and the certification.”Even senators who initially opposed the deal believe the U.S. is better served to remain in the agreement, especially as the administration prepares for a possible summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But they’re not willing to step in legislatively to get rid of the presidential waiver and certification requirements until they have proper assurances from the Europeans that such changes to existing law wouldn’t violate the terms of the JCPOA.“The only reason to do any INARA work would be if there are things that would actually get the president to stay in the deal,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Daily Beast.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“I believe they should actually use the leverage which I think the administration inadvertently created by saying he wants to move away from the deal,” Menendez, a longtime Iran deal skeptic, said. “That’s leverage you could use with the Europeans to get them to join us in multilateral actions outside of the nuclear portfolio, and to get them to bring Iran to the table to deal with the sunset issues.”Trump has quietly and reluctantly issued those waivers and certifications a handful of times throughout his presidency—and the White House said the January waiver was the final one the president would sign. At the time, Trump said the onus was on the Europeans to “fix the terrible flaws,” or else the U.S. would pull out of the deal.Lawmakers who have been briefed on those negotiations don’t expect them to be fruitful.“Right now, in the discussions between Europe and the White House, I think they’re having difficulty because some of the things the president’s asking for is more than Europe is prepared to [give],” Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), who previously served as the ranking member of the foreign relations committee, told The Daily Beast.While Corker had been working behind the scenes with national security adviser H.R. McMaster to preserve the deal, his Republican colleagues appear comfortable with walking away from it. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the Senate’s most strident Iran hawks, has been pushing for new sanctions and other restrictions on Iran outside of the nuclear framework.“The current deal is terrible. The sunset clause is a joke. It’s going to lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,” Graham told The Daily Beast. “And if the Europeans and the Russians and the Chinese don’t help us get a better deal, then I think the president should withdraw.”McMaster, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, have argued to the president that it would be better for the U.S. to stay in the deal—but with Tillerson soon to be gone from that role and McMaster possibly following him out the door, lawmakers worry that the president will have fewer people around him encouraging him to remain in the JCPOA.“Trying to predict what will affect the president’s behavior is very difficult,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. “If you pull out of the deal, I think our allies are going to peel off from us and the U.S. will have broken the coalition.”"},
 {'title': 'Experts: Leaking Michael Cohen’s Bank Records Could Be Illegal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When Stormy Daniels’ lawyer released a dossier on corporate payments allegedly made to President Trump’s personal attorney after the election, many observers questioned how he got access to the confidential bank records. The porn star’s counsel, Michael Avenatti, has declined to reveal where he received his intel on the financial transactions of Michael Cohen’s shell company. The company, Essential Consultants, was also used to wire Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her silence on her alleged Lake Tahoe romp with Trump in 2006.On Tuesday evening, Avenatti released a report alleging Cohen received $500,000 from a New York investment firm connected to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. Titled “Project Sunlight,” Avenatti’s report also alleged Cohen received $200,000 from AT&T and nearly $400,000 from pharmaceutical giant Novartis, in 2017 and early 2018.By the end of Wednesday, Novartis said it paid Cohen’s law firm $100,000 a month—or $1.2 million—for “health-care policy matters.” And AT&T was reported to have paid Cohen closer to $600,000. Both companies said special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, contacted them late last year about Cohen.“We are just getting started…,” Avenatti tweeted after dumping his report, which suggested Cohen had perhaps promised access to the Trump administration for a price.The next day, the Treasury Department’s inspector general launched an investigation into whether Cohen’s private bank records were leaked. Attorneys for Cohen filed court papers hours later, questioning the veracity of Avenatti’s report and how he came to obtain details of the banking transactions.A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told ABC News that investigators are probing whether Suspicious Activity Report information “has been improperly disseminated.” The IG investigation arose from a New York Times report that apparently included the same information Avenatti released, according to ABC News.Under federal law, banks are required to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Treasury Department if they suspect money laundering or fraud. In early April, Avenatti sent a letter to the secretary of the Treasury, asking the agency to release a SAR report relating to Daniels’ $130,000 payday. Still, tax lawyers interviewed by The Daily Beast say they’re puzzled that Avenatti would have access to Cohen’s banking info—especially after Daniels’ civil case was put on hold, and because the feds are still investigating Cohen. They said it’s highly unusual for SARs, which are confidential and not to be made public, to be leaked. Experts told The Daily Beast the level of detail in Avenatti’s report suggests he obtained Treasury documents that only the agency’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) had access to or which were requested by law enforcement—such as the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which has been investigating Cohen for months, reportedly eyeing the Trump stalwart for possible bank fraud, wire fraud, and campaign-finance violations.“I think somebody from the SDNY is leaking,” said Robert Barnes, a Las Vegas-based trial attorney who’s taken Avenatti to task on Twitter. “The degree to which Avenatti had details implicates them badly.”Barnes pointed out that Avenatti was reportedly spotted dining with former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in late March. He added that Cohen could potentially sue Avenatti for invasion of privacy by illegal disclosure of banking information.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Cohen has been under fire for months, after his role in silencing Daniels was exposed by The Wall Street Journal. In early March, Daniels sued Trump and Cohen to void the “hush agreement” she inked weeks before Election Day. The adult actress—born Stephanie Clifford—argues the nondisclosure agreement is invalid because Trump never signed it, because Cohen publicly discussed it, and because it allegedly violates public policy. Last month, the FBI raided Cohen’s home, office, and hotel room for records relating to the Daniels payoff. Agents were also reportedly searching for documents on alleged Trump paramour Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model whose story was bought and buried by the National Enquirer’s parent company.After the raid, Cohen filed for a temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court to stop the feds from reviewing his attorney-client communications. On Wednesday, Cohen’s attorney, Stephen M. Ryan, wrote the federal judge to dispute the findings in Avenatti’s “sunlight” report and to oppose his pending application to intervene in the search-warrant case.Ryan said Avenatti published incorrect statements on Cohen, obtained and published information from Cohen’s bank records, and “has no lawful basis to possess those materials.” Avenatti has made the supposedly false claims “in an attempt to prejudice and discredit” Cohen in the pending criminal probe, Ryan added.“Mr. Avenatti’s conduct in somehow obtaining random bank records and publishing them without proper concern for their accuracy is extremely troubling for the parties in this case, the court, and the public,” Ryan wrote.Avenatti published details on the identities of and payments from Cohen’s “business clients” AT&T and Novartis, Ryan stated. The defense attorney denied Columbus Nova, the firm connected to the Russian oligarch, routed funds to Cohen on behalf of Vekselberg and his cousin Andrew Intrater. Federal investigators have Cohen’s bank records as a result of the April raids, Ryan said, adding, “but we are not aware of any lawful attempts by Mr. Avenatti to obtain these records.”If Avenatti wants to intervene in the Cohen criminal case, “he should be required to explain to this court how he came to possess and release this information,” Ryan wrote. Ryan added that Avenatti’s report erroneously included transactions from different Michael Cohens in Canada and Israel. The former wrote Avenatti an email with the subject line, “No connection with Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s lawyer.”Avenatti wasted no time bashing Ryan on Twitter, calling his filing “baseless, improper, and sanctionable.” Cohen’s team also “effectively concede the receipt of the $500,000 from those with Russian ties,” Avenatti said.Meanwhile, Martin Sheil, a retired branch chief of the IRS Criminal Investigation division, told The Daily Beast that whoever leaked the SARs to Avenatti could face criminal penalties. “That person has to be either bank connected and therefore knowledgeable as to the confidentiality provisions of the SAR process, or this person could be law-enforcement related,” Sheil said. He added, “Every law-enforcement person who has access to the FinCEN database containing SARs must take an online course that goes over the confidentiality provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and FinCEN protocols.”SARs contain warnings not to disseminate, Sheil added. If convicted for disclosing a SAR, someone could face a maximum five years behind bars and/or a $250,000 fine. “So there is a fine line for bankers to tread,” Sheil said. “Avenatti may not know about the confidentiality protections afforded SARs. But I think he should receive a stern warning from the USAO-SDNY and/or a representative of the U.S. Treasury.”Gerald W. Kelly, a Maryland-based tax attorney, agrees that it appears a SAR was leaked and that it’s a crime to do so. He said SARs are typically only a starting point in a criminal investigation and are not incredibly detailed.“I can tell you from defending clients that I’ve never been given the SAR by investigators or assistant U.S. attorneys,” Kelly told The Daily Beast. “I’ve been told they exist and that’s how the investigation started. But I haven’t been given even the level of detail that’s in the press now about Mr. Cohen’s transactions.”Avenatti’s crusade to make Cohen’s SARs public makes little sense; if released, the government would violate its own regulations, as well as federal statutes relating to the confidentiality of tax information, Kelly said. “Whoever the leaker is, it seems like there’s more detail than would just be contained in those forms,” he added. “Someone is feeding Stormy Daniels’ attorney information that they shouldn’t be,” Kelly added. “There’s no exception for it in the regulation.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Lucked Out Bigly With Jeff Flake, His Sole GOP Critic',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump, but has he been an effective one? "Our presidency has been debased. By a figure who seemingly has a bottomless appetite for destruction and division,” Flake said to graduates of Harvard Law School last Wednesday. It was unclear whether he was intentionally referencing a Guns N’ Roses album.Flake went on to lament that America “may have hit rock bottom.”“If you have been wondering what the bottom looks like, this is what it looks like when you stress-test all of the institutions that undergird our constitutional democracy at the same time,” he lamented. Not everyone at Harvard was impressed. Many liberals are reticent to applaud a conservative who talks a tough game, but still votes with the president 84 percent of the time. If Trump were Hitler, then we should resist him at every turn. But he’s not Hitler, and so, intellectually honest conservatives (like Flake) support him when he is right and condemn him when he is wrong. This is almost a thankless endeavor, inasmuch as it alienates the left and the right. But there is another criticism of Flake that, I think, is much more merited: He hasn’t moved the needle. For all Flake’s talk, the only clear deliverable he has wrought is that he will no longer be in the U.S. Senate next year. If your goal is to provide checks and balances against Trumpism, this would seem to be a step backward. What is more, Flake’s exodus sends a signal to current and aspiring conservative politicians that there is no market for Flake-ism. He is a cautionary tale.“Jeff Flake is an honorable and decent public servant, but in the Trump era, that and $1.79 will buy you a bottle of Coke.”So what is the prudent or proper role of an intellectually honest conservative senator? Is speaking out publicly against a president of your own party an act of heroism, or grandstanding and virtue signaling? Is keeping your head down and working to nudge Trump toward the light side an act of cowardice, or a shrewder, more effective, strategy?If one puts aside symbolic and rhetorical acts of courage, and looks instead for concrete deliverables, what has Flake gotten us—or him? A look at his own top priorities suggests the answer is…not much. Flake’s efforts to force a vote on DACA haven’t worked (perhaps he could have leveraged his vote on tax cuts more effectively?). Similarly, his insistence that Congress should be in charge of authorizing military force against ISIS was largely ignored. Let’s compare his legislative prowess to Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), who threatened to use his power to block all Department of Justice nominations after Attorney General Jeff Sessions signaled he would punish states that legalized marijuana. President Trump promptly struck a deal with him. Would Flake have been better off following a similar tack? Part of the problem is that Flake is temperamentally ill-suited to the role of rebel. The old Bill Clinton maxim about how it’s better to be “strong and wrong” than “weak and right” rings true. On paper, Flake’s comments are heroic, but, for some reason, they sound whiny and discordant coming from him. Some politicians are naturally disposed to optimism; others do indignation better. Flake is playing against type. In this defining moment, he’s trying to stand up as a resistance leader, but he has the persona of a boy scout. Consequently, it feels awkward and phony.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Is it possible that Flake might have been more effective at helping manage Trump’s tendencies had he played his cards differently? This is a choice between working with the reality of Trump/conservative populism (and trying to contain the damage) and working to rid the party of Trump/conservative populism (but risking the loss of all of your own influence, especially since partnering with the anti-Trump left creates its own problems).But which strategy is nobler? This is not an academic question. Conservative politicians who are searching for ways to contain Trump’s authoritarian tendencies must wrestle with just how to do that. Is it better to publicly criticize him and end up like Flake, or to work quietly to cajole and influence him, and risk being seen as an enabler? These two things are pretty much mutually exclusive, but one could argue the nobility and virtue of either tactic. America’s institutions are thankfully strong—which is a good thing, since the individuals charged with checking the executive still haven’t figured out how to do it. Conservatives who hope to someday take back their party must study how to win, and part and parcel to that is studying what has not worked. Jeff Flake is an honorable and decent public servant, but in the Trump era, that and $1.79 will buy you a bottle of Coke. \xa0\xa0'},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen, the World’s Worst Fixer, Keeps Screwing Up',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Gasps and murmurs such as are often heard in TV and movie courtroom scenes, but almost never in real life arose when the name of Michael Cohen’s third client was made known.“Sean Hannity,” Cohen’s attorney announced in courtroom 21B in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon.As is rarely heard even on TV, the initial instant of total surprise was then joined by startled laugher, for the whole scene had gone from dramatic to absolutely ridiculous.Cohen is President Trump’s personal lawyer and self-proclaimed fixer, though that implies an ability to fix things. His talents in this regard were certainly called into question when Stormy Daniels arrived at the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan to attend the hearing.Cohen is said to have arranged to pay Daniels’ $130,000 just before the 2016 election to keep quiet about a dalliance with Trump. The deal has become the least confidential confidentiality agreement in history and the media had been duly alerted that Daniels would be attending the hearing. \xa0Camera crews and photographers were there to record Daniels’ entrance in black high heels and a black top, her skirt and jacket a pastel pink, as if the garments were blushing. She herself evidenced not a trace of embarrassment, for this was a walk of fame, not shame.Cohen had arrived earlier, looking almost like a lawyer in a dark suit, white shirt and light blue tie. He entered the courtroom and strode up to what would have been the defendant's table were this a criminal proceeding, curiously mouthing an almost silent greeting to the sketch artists and reporters who filled the jury box in the absence of jurors. “Hi, how are you?”Cohen then took a seat and adjusted the microphone to his height, though he would not be addressing the court. He was a self-proclaimed consigliere who viewed The Donald as a Don, but he was not the day’s main attraction.The reporters quickly lost any immediate interest in him. Their attention returned again and again to the double set of doors leading in from the hallway. They were expectant, then impatient.Where was she?As the proceedings were about to begin, the outside set of doors opened and the Awaited One appeared, only to be stopped by the security officers. So many people had come to see Stormy Daniels that there was no room for Stormy Daniels.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Overflow,” one of the security officers could be heard telling her.She stepped back out in the hallway and the door closed. Expectation turned to dismay. The seemingly lucky souls who had managed to get a seat in the courtroom suddenly seemed less fortunate than those late arrivals consigned to the overflow room.But the walk of fame was not to be thwarted and minutes later Daniels reappeared, this time passing through both sets of doors in the company of her lawyer, whose name is impossible to write without feeling complicit.“Here she comes,” somebody said.Daniels calmly made her way to a folding chair against the wall to the far right. She had appeared in much tougher venues and she was no doubt accustomed to people gawking at her. One person who did not turn to look at Daniels was Cohen. She was somebody to whom he was not going to mouth a greeting, silent or otherwise.“All rise!” the clerk called out.Cohen and Daniels and everybody else obeyed as Judge Kimba Wood took the bench. She had trained for a week to be a croupier—not a bunny and never wearing the outfit, as has been incorrectly reported—at a Playboy Casino in London while going to school there.\xa0She had later quite nearly become the U.S. attorney general and now here she was. She is a favorite of the courthouse security officers, who collectively are an extremely good judge of character.On Friday, Wood had instructed Cohen’s lawyers to provide a list of his clients no later than Monday morning. She had added that she intended to make the names public unless doing so would in itself signal why exactly they had needed representation. The document filed by Cohen’s lawyers reported that he had exactly three legal clients since leaving the Trump organization in 2016. “Mr. Cohen has more attorneys of his own than he has clients,” prosecutor Tom McKay observed.The three most prominently included President Trump, whom Cohen had once described as his only client. A second client had become known on the same day Wood asked for the list. Cohen the fixer had performed about as well keeping things confidential for GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy as he had for the president. \xa0As reported in The New York Times, Cohen facilitated a $1.6 million payment to a former Playboy model named Shera Bechard, who had become pregnant during a liaison with Broidy. The money was to be spaced out over two years, but could not have been for child support, as the woman is said to have chosen not to have the child. The contract Cohen drafted for Broidy and Bechard is said to have used the same aliases—“David Dennison” and “Peggy Peterson”—as in the contract between Trump and the woman who now sat in the courtroom within sight of the fixer who was supposed to have made it all go away.That left a third client, but Cohen’s lawyers had declined to name him in the document despite the judge’s instructions. Cohen’s lawyers had written:“As to the one unnamed legal client, we do not believe that Mr. Cohen should be asked to reveal the name or can permissibly do so.”Now in court, Cohen’s chief lawyer, Stephen Ryan, informed that judge that he was reluctant to reveal the name even under seal. Ryan said he had consulted over the weekend with the third client, who had asked to remain anonymous “because of the notoriety.” “At this point, no one would want to be associated with the case in that way,” Ryan said. “I can give you the name right now in a sealed envelope and provide it to the court.”Ryan noted, “This client is a publicly prominent individual.”A word jumped out regarding how Ryan said the client would feel if he were associated with the case.“Embarrassed.”The judge remained the judge.“I understand he doesn’t want his name out there,” she said. “That’s not enough under the law.” Anybody who had heard the judge’s instructions on Friday could not have been surprised by the words that followed.“I rule that it must be made public now,” Wood said.Ryan asked if he should submit the name in an envelope as he had proposed or just announce it himself in open court.“Whichever you are most comfortable with,” Wood said.Ryan rose.“Your honor, the client’s name is Sean Hannity,” he said.Then came the gasp and murmurs, joined in the next instant by laughs, joined by the thought that the ultimate Trump booster Hannity was embarrassed to be associated with a case involving President Trump’s fixer. Could a step of shame have entered Hannity’s march of fame? Hannity was quick to get on Twitter and deny that Cohen had ever really been his lawyer:“Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.”Hannity may have realized that a good many people were wondering if maybe there was a third contract, maybe even with those same pseudonyms, with Hannity as David Dennison.“I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter,” Hannity then tweeted.Had Cohen instructed his lawyers to comply with the judge’s order and named Hannity in the document submitted Monday morning, there no doubt would have been a bit of buzz. That would have been nothing compared to the attention generated by a Perry Mason moment complete with gasps seldom heard in real life.The Fixer had struck again.Cohen was now either zero-for-three or three-for-three, depending how you score it. The least secret of secret deals for the first client had been followed by the loudest of hush money for the second client and now the least anonymous of anonymities for the third.At the Hannity revelation, Daniels had half smiled, her left hand raised to her mouth. She seemed to grow bleary along with others in the courtroom as Cohen’s lawyers and the prosecutor and an attorney actually representing President Trump offered arguments for the best way to handle the materials that the FBI had seized when raising Cohen’s office, home, hotel room and safety deposit box early last week. To watch her beginning to slump in her chair as the hearing neared an end was to see that it is hard work being Stormy Daniels, certainly harder than being a lawyer with three clients. This is not to say that Cohen does face much harder days to come.Monday ended with the immediate issue of the seized materials not yet resolved. Daniels seemed suddenly energized as she rose and departed the courtroom and took the elevator down to where the cameras awaited. “Look left!” a photographer called to her.She obliged and smiled, but only because she so desired. The Zero-for-Three Fixer emerged soon after. He had at least managed not to forget the blue umbrella he had been carrying when he arrived at the courthouse looking almost like a lawyer."},
 {'title': 'The Real Reason Robert Jeffress Didn’t Belong in Jerusalem',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Donald Trump’s selection of Pastor Robert Jeffress to say a prayer at the opening of the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem has drawn some negative attention.I’m not a big fan of Jeffress, who has waved away concerns about Stormy Daniels. In one especially sycophantic and disturbing instance, Jeffress even used his church choir to perform an original ode to Donald Trump. This is not the proper role of a Christian pastor. But the interesting thing is that the specific charges being leveled at him now—the things that sound so bad to so many untrained ears—could probably have been lodged against respectable Christian theologians and ministers, ranging from Reinhold Niebuhr to Billy Graham.For example, Kyle Griffin, a producer at MSNBC’s The Last Word summed it up thusly: “Robert Jeffress, who has called Islam a ‘false religion,’ says Mormonism is ‘wrong,’ and has preached that all non-Christians—including people who are Jewish—will not go to heaven, will give a blessing at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.” In other words, he is an orthodox Christian. Christianity is, by definition, an exclusive religion. Anyone can become a Christian, but doing so means accepting an exclusive doctrine. According to Christ, “I am\xa0the way\xa0and the truth\xa0and the life.\xa0No one comes to the Father except through me.” This, by definition, means other religions are “false.” It’s a bold claim; there’s no denying that. But a lot of religions make exclusive truth claims. Even the notion that all religions lead to God is, in an ironic sense, an exclusive truth claim. Nor is Christianity the only religion that views non-believers as adhering to a false religion. The term “infidel” comes to mind. Having said that, while orthodox Christians hold to exclusivity, we (disclosure: I count myself as a believer, though I am a sinner and a work in progress) also believe in living side by side with people with whom we disagree. We consider every human to be created in the image of God. We believe in tolerance and pluralism. We pay as much attention to the other part of the Bible that says, “Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.” These declarations made in the Sermon on Mount are embraceable by almost everyone. Mitt Romney fired off his own tweet, noting, “Robert Jeffress says ‘you can’t be saved by being a Jew,’ and ‘Mormonism is a heresy from the pit of hell.’ He’s said the same about Islam. Such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the United States Embassy in Jerusalem.” (Note: At least Jeffress is consistent about his partisan support for the GOP standard bearer. Jeffress said those bad things about Mormonism in 2012, instructing evangelicals not to vote for him in the primary. But he would later endorse Romney in the general.)Romney might want to single out Jeffress, but as Christianity Today has noted, back in 2010, a survey of 1,000 Protestant pastors found that, “Three-quarters of Protestant pastors (75%) disagree with the statement, ‘I personally consider Mormons... to be Christians’…” This is to say that Jeffress’ views are not on the fringe of Christianity—unless Romney thinks two-thirds of Protestant pastors are “bigots.”\xa0(And while Romney is tossing the term around, the church doctrine he grew up with had its own share of problems.)

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.To be fair, a lot of Jeffress’s comments lack not only wisdom, but love.\xa0Jeffress is very comfortable making pronouncements about other people and other faiths (in very unhelpful ways that are likely not intended to actually help the listener). He says things in provocative ways that stir up anger and division. Donald Trump shouldn’t have picked him for this job. It’s true that some people are looking for reasons to attack orthodox Christianity, but Jeffress invites such attacks. He was not the right man to represent America at this important event. Jeffress might be inelegant in the way he talks about the exclusivity of salvation in Christ, but those beliefs are far from being his most egregious and unbiblical statements. It’s his baptizing of Trump’s sins as good that bother me most. That, alone should have disqualified him from giving this prayer. But of course, that is probably the main reason he was invited to deliver it. "},
 {'title': '‘Rip Him Apart’: Trump Glued to James Comey Book Blitz as Feud Escalates',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Friday, President Donald Trump met with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, her talking points and briefing materials in hand, in the Oval Office ahead of one of her routine televised press briefings.During the meeting, the president, according to two people familiar with Friday’s briefing prep, encouraged his spokeswoman to get tough on fired FBI Director James Comey—as a leaker, a fraud, and just another Trump-bashing self-promoter—when she went on TV later that day.“The president wanted her to rip him apart,” one West Wing official with knowledge of the meeting told The Daily Beast.Sanders did not disappoint her boss.“The American people see right through the blatant lies of a self-admitted leaker,” she said in the briefing room on Friday afternoon, dragging Comey’s new book and tour as a “poorly executed PR stunt” designed to make the former FBI chief money and boost his reputation.The book paints an unflattering portrait of Trump as a pathological liar and as someone with Mafia don-like tendencies. The book also dives into Trump’s reported conversation with Comey regarding the alleged “pee tape,” and, as The Daily Beast first reported, includes an anecdote in which Chief of Staff John Kelly called the president “dishonorable” for sacking Comey. The ousted FBI director is on a media and book tour to promote his soon-to-be published work.Sanders also assured reporters and viewers Friday that “one of the president’s greatest achievements” was firing Comey last year, and knocked him as a “disgraced partisan hack.”Later that day, Trump announced in televised remarks that he was targeting another one of his declared enemies—Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad—in a new round of airstrikes on Syria. Although the final decision on military action ended up being front and center for the administration that evening, Comey—as well as the feds’ raid on Trump’s personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen—continued to weigh heavily on the president’s mind as key fixtures in the ongoing drama and vendetta plaguing Trump world.The two subjects popped up in his typically frenzied Twitter account more than tweets about his latest Syria intervention did, showing a president indulging his insatiable penchant for personal grievance and attempts at score-settling. And as Trump headed further into his weekend in Washington, D.C., Comey’s continued ability to get under the president’s skin only became more and more apparent. At times, he seemed triggered in large part by his dedicated viewership of Fox & Friends, one of his favorite and most influential TV shows. At times, he called for “jail” time.“The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more?” Trump tweeted Sunday morning, in just one of several parts of his tirade.“Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” the president subsequently tweeted, testing out a new nickname.On Sunday evening, ABC News aired its 20/20 interview with Comey, which Trump’s advisers and friends who spoke to The Daily Beast in advance of the airing all expected the president to hate-watch, as they all knew he would for a 60 Minutes interview with Stormy Daniels, another Sunday night affair.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“I’m not trying to… by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and, you know, shaking down shopkeepers,” Comey says, in the ABC transcript, comparing Trump to a mobster. “But instead, what I’m talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration. The loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant center of everything, it’s all about how do you serve the boss, what’s in the boss’ interests. It’s the family, the family, the family, the family.”Later in the interview with George Stephanopoulos, the former FBI director answered the question, “was President Trump obstructing justice?” with, “Possibly. I mean, it’s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend… and I’m just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor, it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent.”In the sit-down with Stephanopoulos, Comey was clear that he believes Trump is woefully unqualified for his current job.“I don’t buy this stuff about him being mentally incompetent or early stages of dementia,” Comey said. “He strikes me as a person of above-average intelligence who’s tracking conversations and knows what’s going on. I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president. I think he’s morally unfit to be president. A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds. And that’s not a policy statement. Again, I don’t care what your views are on guns or immigration or taxes.”The Trump White House and Republican National Committee (the latter of which took the initial lead on organizing the anti-Comey pushback campaign) are now both geared up for sustained warfare on Comey, and whatever else he says or does in his memoir and media blitz.“What’s dishonorable is that James Comey lied about leaking information to the media, consistently contradicted himself in testimony, and made a series of bizarre decisions as FBI director,” RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens told The Daily Beast last week. “That’s why Republicans and Democrats alike have said he has no credibility.”Comey’s allies, for their part, like their odds in the coming fight.“There is a campaign of defamation going on, [and] it is being orchestrated by the president, it is being carried out by one of the two national political parties in its formal capacity as a party committee,” Benjamin Wittes, a Brookings Institution scholar and friend of Comey’s, told The Daily Beast on Sunday night ahead of the ABC News interview. “I know of nothing like this… but I think this is genuinely different and extraordinary. And the only thing I can say is it is not a flattering use of the presidency… It doesn’t change [what is] alleged in the book. Yelling about Jim all day isn’t going to change that.”Wittes added, “I trust the public to judge between the characters and credibility of these two men. And I trust [special counsel] Bob Mueller and the judicial process, as well.”"},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen Has Been Under Criminal Investigation for Months, Feds Reveal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s longtime personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, is “under criminal investigation,” the Justice Department said in a court filing on Friday. It’s the first peek at the investigation of Cohen after a raid on his offices and home Monday by FBI agents. Trump called the raid an “attack on our country in a true sense” and has reportedly got the president stewing again about firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed off on the raid, and special counsel Robert Mueller, who made a referral to prosecutors in Manhattan.Cohen has been the subject of a “months-long investigation” into “acts of concealment” and “fraud” as part of an “ongoing grand jury investigation,” the filing said. Prosecutors obtained search warrants on multiple email accounts maintained by Cohen before Monday’s raid, they said.The filing was submitted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York in response to a motion by Cohen earlier Friday that asked a federal judge to block the Justice Department’s access to documents seized in the raid until he reviews them to determine what might be protected by attorney-client privilege (PDF).Prosecutors responded that Cohen’s request “belies the true intent of his motion: To delay the case and deprive the [U.S. attorney’s office] of evidence to which it is entitled.”That evidence includes items those found in Cohen’s residence, office, a hotel room, his safety deposit box, and electronic devices. The items (reportedly emails, tax documents, and business records) were ordered after a magistrate “found probable cause to believe that the premises and devices searched contained evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of conduct for which Cohen is under criminal investigation,” according to the filing.Although the nature of that alleged conduct remains a mystery, the filing says that the investigation “largely centers on [Cohen’s] personal business dealings.”The filing took a direct shot at Cohen’s claim that much of the evidence seized falls under the umbrella of attorney-client privilege. “The searches… seek evidence of crimes, many of which have nothing to do with his work as an attorney, but rather relate to Cohen’s own business dealings,” the filing stated, noting that covert search warrants on multiple different email accounts maintained by Cohen “indicate that Cohen is in fact performing little to no legal work.”Prosecutors also used Cohen and Trump’s words against them in the filing, particularly Trump’s denial that he knew about a $130,000 payment made by Cohen to adult-film star Stormy Daniels\xa0in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels, currently embroiled in her own legal battle with Cohen and the president, says that the payment was made in exchange for her silence about a physical relationship between herself and the president in 2006, shortly after the birth of Trump’s fifth child.Trump has expressed a close interest in the case, calling the raid “a disgraceful situation” and even going to far as to call Cohen ahead of today’s filing to “check in,” according to The New York Times.“There is reason to doubt that even communications with his only publicly identified client [Trump] regarding payments to... Stormy Daniels, would be protected by attorney-client privilege,” a footnote states. “Among other things, President Trump has publicly denied knowing that Cohen paid Clifford, and suggested to reporters that they had to ‘ask Michael’ about the payment.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

On Friday, McClatchy reported that Mueller had evidence that Cohen had made a trip to Prague in late summer 2016. The trip, which Cohen has repeatedly denied, would confirm at least part of the Steele dossier."},
 {'title': 'Roseanne Barr’s Trump Sounds Great. Shame He Doesn’t Exist.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "So Roseanne is back and feeling very Trumpy. Quite a journey for someone who sought the Green Party nomination for president 2012. Or actually, not really. From remarks she made back then to her recent interview in the Times launching the new show, Barr emerges as an exemplar of a very specific type: She’s one of the millions who doesn’t care much for actual facts, but absolutely devours every narrative that blames liberals and the Democratic Party for every one of America’s ills.Back in 2012, she said at a Green Party candidates debate that voters should “just leave the Democratic Party and register as Greens. They could still vote for Obama but it would be sending the Democratic Party itself a message it needs to hear.” It’s quite true that there’s a message the Democrats needed to hear about the pain being felt in left-behind America. It’s highly doubtful that the Green Party, easily the most demographically elitist party in the United States, was the right vehicle to deliver it. But that aside, the quote pegs Barr as one of those left-wing types for whom everything bad is liberalism’s fault.Those types often jump from far left to far right, so it wasn’t surprising to me in the least when during the campaign she started tweeting and retweeting screeds against Hillary Clinton and saying things like “if you don’t endorse Hillary, then you’re anti-American, a racist, a sexist, or whatever names her robots throw around.” More recently, after the congressional softball game shooting last year, she shared a YouTube video that purported to “confirm” that Steve Scalise was in the same hospital that “took out” murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich.Now, in that Times interview, she explains why she thinks the Conners would be Trumpites today. The explanation is built around five observations about life in these United States today and/or criticisms of liberalism. Let’s walk through them.1. She wants the show to be about “everything in our country,” after which she mentions health care, opioids, and gender-fluid kids.Okay, Roseanne. I’ll circle back to opioids, but on health care: Who passed universal health care? And who tried to repeal it 70 times? And which president and party created a system that has enabled about 18 million people to get health care? And which president was fuming at his Republican Congress’ failure to undo it? And by the way about 80 percent of those 18 million got coverage because the expansion of Medicaid made coverage affordable for the first time to working-class families. Families who were, in other words, a lot like the Conners.And on gender-fluid young people… maybe I really missed something, Roseanne, but I’m pretty sure it’s Democrats and liberals who are uniformly sympathetic to these youngsters and who try to pass the hated and mocked bathroom bills to honor their gender choice. And I’m pretty sure it’s Republicans (not all of them, but the vast majority of them) who scream that this is Satan’s work. On opioids, I can’t defend the Obama administration, under which the FDA did nothing about the over-manufacturing and over-prescribing of the drugs. But who wants to bet that the Trump administration is going to do better? The funding in the new budget bill isn’t terrible but is way short of what’s needed, and Trump’s emphasis on treating this as a law-enforcement problem would throw a lot of D.J. Conners (the son in the show) in jail.2. Rosanne complains about the wars we’ve been in “for a long, long time,” and how the swells forget about this but “working-class people don’t forget because their kids are in it.”Yes, that’s correct. And, um, who started these wars? Again, a Republican president started both of them. Yes, many Democrats, including she-who-is-uniquely-evil, voted for them. I think any president would probably have invaded Afghanistan, so it’s not fair to drop that one on George W. Bush, but Iraq was his baby, and a neocon dream going back to 1991. Not sure, Roseanne, how you pin that one on liberalism, or how you exonerate a president who just hired as his national security adviser a man who still thinks that war was a grand idea.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

And completely irrelevant. What matters is not how he “feels.” What matters is what kind of judges he puts on the federal bench, because that’s where same-sex marriage law is established.Anthony Kennedy voted for same-sex marriage. It was a 5-4 vote. Suppose Kennedy retires (rumors are currently flying around Washington). What kind of judge will Trump nominate to succeed him? In all likelihood, one a lot more like Neil Gorsuch than Kennedy. Supreme Court precedents can be overturned, you know. And conservatives are itching to see that decision overturned someday. And Trump has already been stacking the lower courts with anti-LGBT judges. You, Roseanne, can find all this out in about two minutes by Googling it. And then of course you might stop for another two minutes—no; 30 seconds!—and realize that President Clinton would be putting pro-same-sex marriage judges on the Supreme Court and all federal benches. But that doesn’t matter, I guess, next to your righteous anger at her cheerleaders in the media.4. The Times’ Patrick Healy asked her about Trump and labor unions. Here, I can’t improve upon the transcript:Healy: What about labor union protections and blue-collar workers, and—Barr: What do you mean, the—oh, let’s not get into this.Barr’s representative, apparently also present: You don’t have to get into it. We can move on.5. That having not gone well, she moves on to trade and NAFTA. “Well, I think working-class people were pissed off about Clinton and NAFTA…That’s what broke all the unions, and we lost all our jobs…”I’m no defender of NAFTA, but it’s not what broke unions. Roseanne, remember the air-traffic controllers strike? Who fired them? Which party was he in? The private sector quickly followed Ronald Reagan’s example and started replacing workers. “Any kind of worker, it seemed, was vulnerable to replacement if they went out on strike, and the psychological impact of that, I think, was huge,” Georgetown historian Joseph McCartin told NPR. “The loss of the strike as a weapon for American workers has some rather profound, long-range consequences.”Look, Roseanne can run whatever kind of show she wants. I think it’s pretty obvious that Dan (John Goodman) would have been a Trump voter; then again it’s demographically quite likely that Dan would have been a Reagan-Reagan-Bush-Dole-Bush-Bush-McCain-Romney voter (although some such men voted Democratic in 1996 and 2008 in particular). I think it’s unlikely that the Roseanne Conner of the old show, a roaring feminist with all those gay and lesbian co-workers and friends, would have voted against the first woman major-party candidate. But it’s her show.But really. The things you profess to care about, Roseanne, are the things the Democratic Party has been trying to do something about, and the Republican Party has been trying to block. Those facts have been overwhelmed by narratives that sound like they explain everything and that feed some emotional need inside the people who embrace them. But someone loses when rich television stars who don’t have to worry about their health care are the ones doing the embracing, and they’re the people whose interests she says she’s representing. "},

  'body': 'Even as female journalists like Maggie Haberman, Andrea Mitchell, and Mika Brzezinski come to the defense of both her and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kellyanne Conway still just doesn’t seem capable of taking yes for an answer. Conway sat in icy silence at Saturday night’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner as comedian Michelle Wolf called out her tendency to mislead the media. “If you don’t give her a platform, she has nowhere to lie,” Wolf told reporters in the room. “It’s like that old saying: If a tree falls in the woods, how do we get Kellyanne under that tree?” Wolf’s jokes about Sanders received even more backlash, with many falsely claiming she criticized the press secretary’s appearance. During an appearance on Hannity Monday night, Conway was still fuming. As much as Sean Hannity didn’t want to “dignify this ridiculous dinner,” he said it would “negligent” to not ask his guest for her thoughts on the “insulting and crude” comedy routine. And she had some.“Sean, in some ways there was very little that was surprising on Saturday night,” Conway said, smiling. “The faux outrage from some people who look down at Twitter all day long and see the likes of Sarah and Ivanka and me insulted—this just happened right in front of them when they were all gussied up so they couldn’t deny it. I mean, in some ways it was just another day at the office.” “But it doesn’t make some people any less miserable or us any less powerful,” Conway added, cryptically, before pivoting to dutifully defend her boss, saying the dinner “fed right into all of the cynicism, the skepticism that a lot of Americans have about the mainstream media writ large.” At that point, Hannity tried to move on to his next topic, but Conway continued talking about her failed attempts to find out how much Wolf was paid to speak at the dinner. “When the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association stood up and said, ‘An attack on one journalist is an attack on all journalists,’ well folks, think about this,” she said. “Is an attack on one woman, or two women, an attack on all women?” “I’m glad I didn’t interrupt you, that’s a powerful line,” Hannity responded. He then started asking her about North Korea without mentioning the numerous times Donald Trump actually has attacked women for the way they look.'},
 {'title': 'Melania Trump’s ‘Be Best’ Lifehack for Teens: Don’t Do Sexting',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "First lady Melania Trump announced her platform on Monday, which is somewhat confusingly called “Be Best.” As expected, one of the pillars of her platform focuses on creating a safer place for teens in the digital world.Her decision to address social media’s role in American teenagers’ lives in the context of cyberbullying was not surprising. What was, however, were the bizarre tips offered within a guide called “Talking With Kids About Being Online,” which includes gems like: “Texting shorthand can lead to misunderstandings.” (LOL)The most blatantly strange tip though? This one on sexting:Here’s the problem. While Melania Trump certainly has her heart in the right place in attempting to ensure the digital world is a tad bit kinder, the advice is, well, awful.To have a parent tell a child, particularly a teenager, to not do something is practically an invitation for that child to go out and do that very forbidden thing. As neuroscientists and psychologists have mapped for decades now, the limbic regions of the brain are extremely sensitive during adolescence. What do these centers do? They monitor risk-taking behavior. And teens are magnetically drawn to risky behavior.This makes telling a teen to not sext ironically an invitation to do that very behavior.Even then, the implication that sexting leads to risky sex is not true. In January, the Centers for Disease Control released a report showing a steep decline in teen sex over the course of the last decade, with 2018 rates hovering around 41 percent.That and sexting might actually not be bad, particularly among older teenagers. Some argue that sexting is a normal, potentially positive way for teenagers to develop sexual behavior in the digital age. And while sexting is often associated with poor body image, depression, and loneliness, actual evidence linking these to sexting is practically non-existent. A meta-analysis of 39 studies covering 110,380 participants published just last month in JAMA Pediatrics shows that sexting is prevalent among teenagers. On average, nearly 15 percent of teens sent texts, and more than 27 percent of teens received texts. The older the teenager, the more likely they were to send and receive sexts.The problem with sexting isn’t necessarily the action of it. Sexting, in and of itself, is not necessarily a problematic behavior. It is risky, for sure, but teens engaging in risky activity is old news.What is problematic is the fact that teens who send sexts—thereby “risking their reputation and friendships,” as Trumps says—are considered responsible if the receiver then shares those messages with a wider audience. The same JAMA Pediatrics analysis found that consent is a major problem among teenage sexters: Teens were forwarded a sext without consent about 12 percent of the time, and had a sext forwarded without their consent more than eight percent of the time.That’s where Trump’s guidelines fall apart. Sexting by definition isn’t necessarily limited to sending sexts, and the problems associated with them and teenagers—risky sexual behavior being the dominant one—aren’t limited to teens who sent sexts, but those who receive them, as well. That, and the fact that there are sexts teens receive that are sent to them without their consent makes the problem that much trickier. The JAMA Pediatrics authors say as much, writing that “Further research focusing on nonconsensual sexting is necessary to appropriately target and inform intervention, education, and policy efforts.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Lawyers Sharing Space With Anti-‘Deep-State’ Group',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump’s legal team has done work out of the Capitol Hill offices of a conservative nonprofit group run by one of the president’s lawyers.Two sources familiar with the situation say attorneys representing the president in the probe into Russian election meddling have met at and worked out of the headquarters of the American Center for Law and Justice, a 501(c)(3) legal advocacy nonprofit run by Jay Sekulow, a member of the president’s legal team.A spokesperson for the ACLJ did not dispute this report. "The American Center for Law and Justice has maintained a Washington D.C. office for many years,” said Gene Kapp, a spokesperson for the organization. “The work done by the ACLJ is separate and distinct from the work performed by those who serve as Counsel to the President. Any non-ACLJ related work that occurs at the ACLJ offices is reimbursed in compliance with all applicable tax laws.”From a strictly legal perspective, the arrangement appears above board, so long as ACLJ is charging market rates to rent the space, according to Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog. “The only way this would be an issue is if ACLJ was offering its services at less than fair market value, or using ACLJ resources without being compensated” by the president, the White House, or the Trump campaign, Fischer said in an email. As Sekulow represents the president in matters related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s Russia investigation, ACLJ has also pursued litigation that, while not directly related to that investigation, aligns with efforts by the president and his allies to deflect from allegations that the Russian government worked to elect Trump in 2016.ACLJ is currently suing the State Department for records related to U.S. approval for the sale of a Canadian mining company with U.S. uranium interests to a state-owned Russian energy firm. A large shareholder in the Canadian company, Uranium One, was also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation, leading to allegations by President Trump and his allies that Clinton facilitated the sale to Russian firm Rosatom in exchange for contributions to her group.Clinton’s State Department was just one of nine federal agencies that signed off on the sale. Nevertheless, President Trump has repeatedly invoked the controversy to deflect from allegations that his campaign may have colluded with Russian actors to tip the presidential election in his favor. Congressional Republicans and outside allies have demanded a second special counsel to investigate issues surrounding Clinton’s role in the Uranium One deal.ACLJ has worked to boost other major talking points used by critics of Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign. A number of those critics allege a conspiracy by agents of the “deep state”—career bureaucrats and intelligence and law enforcement officials—to undermine the Trump administration.On its website, ACLJ hosts a petition asking for support in its “legal demands and lawsuits against the deep state bureaucracy.” That bureaucracy, it claims, is perpetrating a “soft coup” against the U.S. government.The ACLJ also works on conservative Christian priorities, including litigation for pro-life crisis pregnancy centers and protesters who picket abortion clinics. The organization has long drawn scorching criticism from LGBT rights advocates. When the Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that states could not ban same-sex couples from having sex, Sekulow said he disagreed with the ruling.

 {'title': 'Conspiracy-Mongers: ‘#MeToo Is... Russian Propaganda’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned Monday night after four women accused him of abuse in a bombshell New Yorker investigation. But fringe figures wasted no time suggesting a larger conspiracy.The four women, two of whom agreed to speak the New Yorker on the record, accused Schneiderman of hitting and choking them, with one woman alleging that Schneiderman called her his “slave.” The allegations, which Schneiderman denies, are particularly damning in light of Schneiderman’s attempts to investigate sexual misconduct by disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein, and by the alleged sex cult Nxivm. Within hours of the allegations, some conspiracy-pushers seized onto those ties to hype a pro-Trump sex trafficking theory. Others turned on Schneiderman’s alleged victims, accusing them of running “Russian propaganda.”The latter allegation came from Louise Mensch—a former member of the UK’s Parliament who now spends her time peddling absurd theories about the Trump administration, including the claim that former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has already been convicted and sentenced to death. But Mensch still boasts a massive audience, with approximately 277,000 followers on Twitter, alone.“Me Too is, and always has been, Russian propaganda,” Mensch tweeted Monday night. “Democrats swallowed it whole, like idiots; now brought out with a flourish to attack America.”She later doubled down to call the allegations “a pack of lies about @AGSchneiderman and a victory for @PutinRF,” and to call for prosecution of Schneiderman accuser Michelle Manning Barish “and these other liars.”Like many women who accuse powerful men of abuse, Schneiderman’s exes have already been attacked online by people accusing them of lying for money. Shortly after Schneiderman accuser Manning Barish tweeted a link to the New Yorker story Monday night, Twitter users piled into her mentions, attacking her nine-year-old daughter and accusing Manning Barish of accepting bribes, as The Daily Beast reported.But internet users plugged into Mensch’s particular brand of Trump-Russia conspiracy-mongering have saved extra vitriol for women who accuse powerful Democrats of abuse. When multiple women accused former Senator Al Franken of sexual misconduct, Mensch and her cohort also accused them of running Russian interference. And when right-wing media hucksters Mike Cernovich and Chuck Johnson briefly attempted to report on a fake sexual harassment case against Sen. Chuck Schumer, Mensch suggested the hoax was all part of Franken’s plan to weed out false allegations and proclaim his innocence.Meanwhile, pro-Trump conservatives have taken the opposite tack with Schneiderman—that it was the Attorney General, not his accusers, running interference for an evil cabal. Members of this camp support a 4chan-based conspiracy theory called QAnon, which accuses Trump’s opponents (particularly Hillary Clinton) of satanism, sex-trafficking, and pedophilia.The theory’s true believers have latched onto reports about Nxivm, an alleged sex cult that recruited women. Websites like Your News Wire, which peddle wholly-invented conservative conspiracies, recently ran headlines claiming a Nxivm member “Confesses She Sold Children To Rothschilds And Clintons.” (The bogus claim makes no appearance in the text of the article.) Iterations of the article appeared on QAnon-themed subreddits, and have made the rounds in other conservative social media. Immediately after Schneiderman’s resignation, QAnon believers began circulating an early April report about Schneiderman suspending New York State’s investigation into Nxivm. A flurry of fringe-right websites and social media posts implied that Schneiderman might have been covering up for Nxivm, which QAnon followers falsely believe was involved in selling child sex slaves to the Clintons.The first line of April report on the Nxivm investigation states that Schneiderman was postponing the state-level probe in cooperation with federal authorities who had launched their own investigation into the alleged cult.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'body': 'The Virginia Senate on Wednesday voted to approve Medicaid expansion, which would impact the lives of up to 400,000 citizens in the state.As such, Virginia becomes just the second state during the Donald Trump presidency to approve such a program, following only Maine. Yet even there, Republican Gov. Paul LePage faces a lawsuit for his refusal to actually implement the program. Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who handily won election last November sweeping in enough Democrats to nearly flip the state’s House of Delegates, campaigned on expansion and will undoubtedly sign it into law. The House of Delegates had previously voted in favor of expansion but would have to now approve the Senate bill or go to conference prior to getting Northam’s signature. Virginia will become the 33rd state overall, plus Washington D.C., to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which was first signed into law in 2010.The budget, however, does include work requirements for those who are newly covered, a concession that may have been necessary to get some Republican votes. Four Republican members of the Senate broke ranks to vote for the bill on Wednesday.In other more red states, advocates have been fighting to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot, including a recently successful effort in Utah. In Idaho, a group of volunteers criss-crossed the state to get the necessary signatures for putting Medicaid expansion on the state ballot in November. “It’s time to put the excuses aside,” Northam said in an interview on Wednesday prior to the vote. “Whether you’re in favor of the Affordable Care Act or not… it is the law of the land, and we need to take advantage of the resources that we’ve sent to Washington, and bring them back to Virginia.”'},
 {'title': 'So if Trump Fires Mueller, the Republicans Will Do… What, Exactly?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Quiz time: What does Antonin Scalia have to do with Robert Mueller?Answer: Maybe more than you think. We’ll get to that. But first let’s review. As I wrote Tuesday, Lindsey Graham and Thom Tillis, the two Republican senators who last year put their names on two pieces of “protect Mueller” legislation, now see no need for their own bills. There must be some fable from Aesop—or better still, an old Russian proverb—about the townspeople who keep refusing to believe the malevolent visitor is going to destroy the town until the day it lay in ruins. And if there isn’t, we could make it up right now. There were once some Republicans in Congress who simply couldn’t believe the president would fire a special prosecutor...The day my last column appeared, Mitch McConnell, theretofore silent, actually came out with some reasonably forceful words. Of Robert Mueller, he said: “This is a thoroughly credible individual, I think it was an appropriate appointment, and we all anticipate his finishing the job and telling the American people what they need to know about this episode.”That’s not terrible. Not as ridiculous as Paul Ryan’s statement (he’d “received assurances” that the firing was not under consideration). But still, here’s what’s missing from all these Republican comments on the matter.Firing Mueller, they say, constitutes a red line. Which, if Trump crossed it, would compel them to do exactly what?They never say. Would they hold hearings? Demand appointment of a new counsel, in the event that Mueller was found to have run afoul of some shoddily invented “conflict of interest”? Pursue these “protect Mueller” bills, and make them retroactive? Most dramatically, would they push their counterparts in the House to start drawing up articles of impeachment?None of them will ever say. This week, Tara Golsham of Vox cornered five GOP senators on the Hill and asked them why they saw no need for legislation to protect Mueller, and what exactly they would do if he were were fired (and worth remembering, always: Trump can’t fire him directly; that would have to be done by Deputy AG Ron Rosenstein). Here’s a sampling of what they said.Bob Corker: “Do I think there would be a significant backlash if he were fired? Yes. Do I think the administration is planning to do it? No.”John Kennedy: “His lawyer says he’s not going to fire Mr. Mueller. I don’t expect him to fire Mr. Mueller. And so I think this is all an academic exercise.”Rob Portman, on what the Senate would do: “Well, I don’t know what it would be” (elevator door closes).Jeff Flake: “Well, the problem is that I’m not convinced the two pieces of legislation that have been introduced are constitutional.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Profiles in courage, as you can see. But Flake raises an interesting point, and here we circle back around to Scalia.The two bills specifically provide for the following. The first, by Cory Booker and Lindsey Graham, would require a panel of three federal judges to review a proposed firing of a special counsel before it could be finalized. The second, by Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Thom Tillis, would allow a fired special counsel to appeal the firing to a three-judge federal panel.What’s the difference, you ask? It’s that the first bill could possibly be seen as the legislative branch interfering in the executive branch’s prerogative—telling a president whom to hire and fire. That is why Coons and Tillis crafted their legislation, which was dropped shortly after the Graham-Booker bill, the way they did—to answer precisely that concern because it wouldn’t preclude a firing, it would review it.In any case, says Daniel Hemel of the University of Chicago Law School, the Supreme Court has weighed in on this. The case was Morrison v. Olson in 1988 (and yes, Olson was the same Ted Olson whom Trump now is begging to join his legal team; back then, he was accused of having given misleading testimony to a House committee). This is the case in which the court, by 7-1, upheld the independent counsel law as constitutional. Hemel explains why that precedent should hold here: “The Court held that for-cause removal restrictions protecting the independent counsel do not violate the separation of powers.\xa0Because the special counsel is even less independent than the independent counsel under the old Ethics in Government Act, the imposition of identical removal restrictions for the special counsel is even less problematic than the restrictions upheld in\xa0Morrison.” It’s binding precedent.But that one dissenter was the conservative jurisprudential godhead—Scalia. And it was one of his most blistering dissents, containing his admittedly prescient critique that an independent counsel could become a law unto himself. So over the years in conservative circles, it’s practically become as if the opinion—on which William Rehnquist and Thurgood Marshall agreed!—is garbage and the dissent is the law. And that reverence for the Great Nino may help explain—not as much as their fear of all those Trump-loving base voters, but helps—why Republicans don’t want to push these bills. They’d be relying on a Supreme Court precedent they reject.Coons and Booker reportedly are still hoping against hope they can bring Tillis and Graham around. Well, good luck to them. But it’s not likely to happen. And even these bills, good though they are, go only part of the way. Mueller is not an “independent” counsel but just a special counsel, and therefore his role is strictly governed by the Justice Department. Unlike Ken Starr, he has no unlimited budget. Rosenstein sets it. Likewise, Rosenstein can decide any Oct. 1 to cut the funding off and close the office down.The Democrats at some point ought to go ahead and write a protect Mueller bill that has all that in it, as Hemel and his Chicago colleague Eric Posner wrote in this New York Times op-ed last year. He who waits forever waits in vain. Ees olt Rahssiyan sayink."},

  'body': "Did one of Trump’s judicial nominees really say that Brown v. the Board of Education, the landmark Supreme Court case ending segregated schools, may have been wrongly decided?Sort of—but only to hide her extreme views on abortion. \xa0So far, every one of the pro-life judges that Trump has nominated has followed the same script on abortion: refuse to answer whether Roe v. Wade was rightly decided, but say that you’ll put aside your personal views and follow Supreme Court precedent.Wendy Vitter, nominated to the federal bench in the Eastern District of Louisiana, was following that script Wednesday when Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, well, OK, what about Brown?“I get into a difficult area,” Vitter replied, “when I start commenting on Supreme Court decisions—which are correctly decided, which I disagree with. Again, my personal, political, or religious views, I would set aside.”Oops.So, now there are headlines like “Trump federal judicial nominee refuses to say whether she supports racial segregation in schools.” \xa0That’s not really fair, but it’s hard to feel much sympathy for Vitter, whose anti-science, anti-choice comments have been so extreme that she failed to disclose them in her judicial questionnaire. That’s the real scandal.  Of course, since the filibuster’s been eliminated for judicial nominees, it’s all a song and dance anyway. \xa0So far, not a single Republican senator—not McCain, not Flake, nobody—has voted against a single Trump judicial nominee. All you have to do is somehow, some way make it through your confirmation hearing, and then you can do what you were put on the bench to do: Please Evangelical voters by chipping away at the right to abortion (and now contraception as well).That’s how we get spectacles like Vitter refusing to agree (or disagree) with one of the most important civil-rights cases in history.Incidentally, if Vitter’s name rings a bell, it’s because she’s married to David Vitter, the former Republican senator and hard-right “family-values” firebrand who was forced to admit that he frequented the “D.C. Madam” prostitution ring.\xa0(He is rumored to have paid prostitutes to spank him while he wore adult diapers, though this was never confirmed.)But Wendy Vitter is an extremist in her own right who should never have been nominated to the federal bench.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Then Blumenthal read them to her.\xa0Then Vitter said that, oh yes, that was me, but I wouldn’t let my personal views decide cases. Then Blumenthal interrupted, saying, “I’m really not asking you about setting aside personal views. I’m asking you, very simply: You said Planned Parenthood kills 150,000 females a year. 150,000 people. Do you stand by that statement? It’s a yes or no.”Vitter’s astonishing reply was “Senator, I feel, again, my pro-life stance has been very clear.”In other words, yes, she stands by that categorically false statement.\xa0(It’s not even clear what pseudo-science/fake-news source she got it from.)Also in 2013, Vitter promoted a brochure that said, among other things, that using birth control causes women to be assaulted or murdered, because women on the pill tend to prefer men with similar genetic backgrounds, and such couplings lead to more violence. Confronted with this claim by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Vitter admitted that it made no sense at all.At the same panel, Vitter praised Texas’s efforts to “mak[e] it very difficult to get abortions” by requiring abortion providers to abide by a host of new regulations.\xa0In 2016, the Supreme Court struck down those regulations as scientifically unjustified and an “undue burden” on women seeking care.Notably, Vitter omitted these two 2013 events in her Senate questionnaire. In 2010, then-Senator Jeff Sessions pointed out that such omissions—in that case, by Obama judicial appointee Goodwin Liu—are felonies punishable by two years in jail, and Senate Republicans filibustered Liu’s nomination as a result. Again, that’s when there was a filibuster.The fact is, it doesn’t matter that Vitter is a liar, an extremist, a promoter of pseudo-science, and, as an added bonus, someone unwilling to say whether Brown v. the Board of Ed was rightly decided. She’s going to be confirmed because she is “pro-life.” \xa0Everyone knows that these confirmations are a charade. The federal judiciary is being packed by hard-right extremists, especially when it comes to women’s health and reproductive issues: One judge compared abortion to slavery, another called transgender kids evidence of “Satan’s plan,” still another was deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association because of his “local reputation for bias.”Vitter’s choreographed dance steps on abortion are a charade as well. Of course, judges don’t simply import their personal religious views into their decision-making. But they do evaluate cases based on their values and ideologies. If you think that Roe v. Wade was an example of judicial overreach, you are going to take a narrow reading of it when an abortion or contraception case comes your way.And that’s the whole point. Vitter is where she is because evangelicals elected Trump to end legal abortion.\xa0It’s that simple. And yet she has contorted herself into such a knot denying that obvious truth that she’s ended up looking like a bigot who can’t condemn segregation. If you ask me, that’s just desserts."},

More importantly in terms of the state\'s future, her victory shrinks the conservative majority on the state’s highest court from 5-2 to 4-3, which could have implications on future voting rights issues and gerrymandering. It is also another data point suggesting that nationwide and in Wisconsin specifically, the tide may be turning to Democrats’ favor. In January, Democrat Patty Schachtner won a special election in Senate District 10, flipping a seat that had been in Republicans\' since 2000. Donald Trump won that district 55-38 in the 2016 presidential election. Republican Governor Scott Walker had refused to hold special elections for two vacancies in the state following that election. But last week, he finally called them after three separate judges ordered that he should. In the aftermath of Tuesday\'s election, Walker tweeted his concern for the future. "Tonight’s results show we are at risk of a #BlueWave in WI," he wrote. "The Far Left is driven by anger & hatred -- we must counter it with optimism & organization. Let’s share our positive story with voters & win in November."'},
 {'title': 'Trump Aides Brutally Turn on Each Other in War on Leaks',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Not long after news broke that White House communications aide Kelly Sadler had made a flippant comment about Sen. John McCain’s (R-AZ) impending death from brain cancer, President Donald Trump gathered a small group of staffers in the Oval Office. The conversation included Sadler herself, chief of staff John Kelly, director of strategic communications Mercedes Schlapp, and principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, and the topic was, at least partially, the “leakers” terrorizing the Trump administration from within. Trump let it be known that he was displeased before asking Sadler whom she thought were prominent leakers in the ranks. As first reported by Axios, Sadler shocked those in attendance by pointing to, among others, Schlapp. What happened next, however, was equally dramatic and potentially far more critical for the future of an already frail White House communications staff. Schlapp recoiled in indignation, aghast that anyone would suggest she would betray the president—least of all a more junior aide whom she had given increasing responsibilities within the administration.Trump sat behind the Resolute Desk, watching the drama unfold in real time. The meeting adjourned shortly after the tense—even for the Trump White House—exchange. But the drama didn’t end there. Two sources recounted that Schlapp remained heated, saying that in separate conversations detailing what happened in the Oval, she referred to Sadler as “a bitch.”Schlapp vehemently denied saying the word and insinuated that any suggestion she had done so was, itself, a malicious leak designed to undermine her. “I have never used that word to describe anyone on the White House staff,” she said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “This smear by anonymous sources is not fit for print by any reputable news outlet. The leakers should be more concerned about promoting the president’s agenda than trying to take down fellow members of the team.”Whether or not an epithet was used, for some inside the administration, is of secondary concern. Far more important was the chaos that the episode illuminated about the state of the president’s communications staff. After weeks of trying to patch together a coherent operation, the framework appears to be falling utterly apart. Leaks, chief among them the one involving Sadler’s McCain comments, have decimated morale. But factionalism was the real poison, with aides growing more and more convinced that enemies within are spreading gossip and innuendo to enhance their own standing.The end result is a Trump White House that more closely resembles scenes from the kind of reality TV that Donald Trump used to host before he became leader of the free world. “The only thing that would have made this scene better is if Omarosa were somehow involved in it,” a former West Wing official said, obviously referencing Trump’s hit TV show The Apprentice, of which Omarosa Manigault was a recurring villain, years before she became an actual Trump administration official.Shah said in a brief statement, “In my conversations with Mercy and others, she did not use that word.” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, conveyed something similar. Other White House officials, when asked about the incident, pointed The Daily Beast to past press briefings where spokespersons have said that it is an internal staff matter that will be handled, and discussed, internally.But sources close to the president suggested that firings would come sometime soon and that they would be targeting members of the communications team. Late last week, Schlapp and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders met to discuss potential personnel changes as a means of stemming the flow of White House leaks. And according to two administration sources, Sadler’s name was among those raised as a possible target for dismissal.Sadler had appeared to have weathered the storm following her controversial comments on McCain. But some officials who spoke to The Daily Beast described her calling out Schlapp as a potentially fatal mistake.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.It wasn’t her only slip-up, either. Early last week, Sadler sent a series of White House talking points to a large email list of academics and think tank scholars. But she forgot to “bcc” the recipients, as is standard, instead including a list of all their email addresses at the top of the message, a copy of which was reviewed by The Daily Beast. It was a small hiccup but still another blemish for a press shop eager to appear less amateurish. Following Daily Beast inquiries, two White House sources independently referred to it as the “BCC fuck-up.”Ultimately, it will be left to the president to decide Sadler’s fate, along with the future of his communications operation. Those close to Trump said he was not turned off by the McCain comment. If anything, it may have helped her, at least momentarily. “This [White House] has no shortage of infighting and backstabbing,” one White House official said. “But what Kelly did, that takes [a] gigantic pair of balls.”"},
 {'title': 'Gina Haspel’s Interrogation Program Hurt Americans Too',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'One of the leaders who helped enact the CIA’s former interrogation program—and saved herself and her colleague from prosecution for this program by illegally destroying videotape evidence—has been nominated to lead the nation’s preeminent spy agency. Democratic senators appear ready to contest this nomination, an effort many Republicans are decrying as partisan politics at its worst.There was a time when both Democrats AND Republicans understood that the “cruel and unusual punishment” of prisoners was unconstitutional, violating both federal laws and U.S.-signed treaties. Americans understood that our nation’s real strength lay not in applying brute force in greater measure or more precisely than our enemies, but in the coherence our national values gave us. This coherence gave us resolve, it enabled strong alliances with other great democracies, and it served as an inspiration to people everywhere struggling with despotic regimes.As an Air Force major in 2005, one of this piece’s co-authors reported for duty at the unit charged with fighting foreign fighters in Iraq. Upon arriving, he and other new interrogators received a PowerPoint briefing that said the number one reason foreign fighters came to Iraq were the Gitmo and Abu Ghraib scandals. This was no idle observation. This facility had processed hundreds of foreign fighters, and its leaders KNEW why jihadists were coming to Iraq.As an Army captain in 2003 in Baghdad, the other co-author received no actionable intelligence from Abu Ghraib’s interrogators at the height of abuses there, as well as witnessed the flood of foreign fighters this and other torture scandals caused in Iraq. Due to these fighters’ seizure of Fallujah, his division’s deployment was extended, and he subsequently had a friend killed and soldiers injured by IEDs.Beyond the lives taken by America’s torture program, there was this program’s psychological damage, not only to those tortured but to the Americans involved. One of us co-edited, and both of us contributed essays to, a new anthology titled War and Moral Injury: A Reader. Contributors come from the fields of psychology, theology, philosophy, psychiatry, law, journalism, neuropsychiatry, classics, poetry, and the profession of arms. Moral Injury, the authors collectively argue, is an identity- or soul-damaging injury with terrible consequences. It is not PTSD, but it may accompany PTSD and often proves the most enduring and harmful invisible wound of war. One of the book’s themes is the impact of America’s torture program on some Americans. There is the first-hand account of Bill Edmonds, a Special Forces officer who suffered a near-suicidal breakdown five years after he witnessed, and failed to stop, Iraqis from torturing their prisoners. There is the story of soldiers at a jail in Iraq who deprived prisoners of sleep, food, and drink as well as beat, choked, and waterboarded some prisoners.After their return home, several struggled with drugs and alcohol, insomnia, high blood pressure, depression, and keeping jobs. Two of them eventually died under circumstances that friends and family believe was suicide. Other sad tales are mentioned. Alyssa Peterson, a young intelligence analyst, committed suicide in 2003 after being reprimanded for refusing to torture. Tony Lagouranis, an Army interrogator at Abu Ghraib and another U.S. facility in Mosul that tortured prisoners, still lives today in fear of “his own evil,” an evil he considers his constant companion. We don’t doubt that Haspel and other leaders at the time believed that America’s torture program would save American lives. They thought they were doing dirty deeds for good ends. Some of these leaders, contrary to all evidence, still protest that this program saved more American lives than it took. We also understand that legal memoranda—quickly withdrawn when shown the light of day—were contrived to justify the program and protect those participating in it. Leaders like Haspel, however, could not have read those memoranda and seen them as anything but what they were: an attempt to make the Constitution and U.S. law appear elastic where they weren’t. In their misguided defense of American lives, these leaders failed to defend something just as important—our republic. Their abject failure created the Abu Ghraib, Gitmo, and CIA black site scandals that were such a recruiting boon for jihadist terrorists, seriously lessened America’s stature among allies, psychologically harmed many of America’s prisoners (whether terrorists or not), and led to the moral injuries of so many courageous Americans sworn to serve.Hopefully, the republic that all Americans lived in before 9/11 still exists, and the nomination of a bright, competent, well-liked but morally misguided leader to such a prominent post will be contested by senators across the political spectrum. If our republic is to endure, our nation requires the strong, bipartisan leadership these senators can show us today.Doug Pryer is a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and author of the book The Fight For the High Ground. Tony Camerino is a retired Air Force Major, Iraq veteran, and author of How to Break a Terrorist (written under the pseudonym Matthew Alexander). They are both contributors to the recently released book War and Moral Injury.'},
 {'title': 'Investigators Vow to Pursue Individual Criminal Probes as Cambridge Analytica Is Liquidated',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'LONDON—British law enforcement officials vowed to continue their pursuit of Cambridge Analytica via criminal probes into individual members of staff after the company sent its remaining employees home and reportedly told them the company would be liquidated on Tuesday.Shuttering the company makes it impossible for the Information Commissioners’ Office (ICO) to impose financial sanctions on Cambridge Analytica—or individuals who worked for the political consultancy—but investigators will still be able to pursue criminal proceedings. An official at the ICO said their investigation would press ahead undeterred.“Even after today’s announcement, the investigation is very much continuing,” an ICO official told The Daily Beast. “If there were any criminal offences… they would follow any individuals wherever they went.”Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump presidential campaign in 2016, was forced into legal and financial jeopardy after the emergence of a whistle-blower. Christopher Wylie claimed the consultancy had misused Facebook data from 87 million people for its political campaigns, which could be bolstered—according to secretly recorded boasts from its former CEO—by nefarious tactics including bribery, espionage, and honeytraps.After filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of New York last week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that 40 members of staff were told that no credible buyer was willing to rescue the beleaguered company. As a result, administrators sent the staffers home, saying the company would be liquidated to pay off creditors.Cambridge Analytica was established as a political offshoot of the long-standing British company SCL, which specialized in military influence operations. Steve Bannon, the former White House adviser, and Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of Robert Mercer, former co-CEO of America’s most lucrative hedge fund, were on the board of the company, which succeeded in making its American political breakthrough with the Trump campaign.An associate of Mercer initially said she was standing by Cambridge Analytica when the secretly recorded footage emerged. The buffoonish former Eton schoolboy, Alexander Nix, who had been caught on tape, was fired, but company executives subsequently admitted that the reputational damage was too great for the company to continue.There was speculation that the Cambridge Analytica operation would be revived under the new name Emerdata, a company that was established in London last summer. According to the bankruptcy filing in New York, Emerdata had an 89.5 percent direct ownership interest in Cambridge Analytica. Emerdata also paid the legal fees for the bankruptcy filing. But Nigel Oakes, the founder of SCL, announced this month that Emerdata would also be shut down.“The whole lot is gone. There’s no secret,” he told Bloomberg. “It’s the end of the show.”British and American authorities, however, are determined that the show will go on. Wylie has said he is cooperating with investigations by the National Crime Agency in Britain as well as the Department of Justice and the FBI in the U.S.The American investigation is reportedly focused on financial dealings and how the company acquired and used data from Facebook. Simultaneous investigations in London are being carried out by the National Crime Agency and the Information Commissioners’ Office, which is in possession of the computers and servers from the company’s London HQ. “We will carry on examining them,” an ICO official said, explaining that any evidence of criminal behavior or wrongdoing would be shared with relevant law enforcement bodies.'},
 {'title': 'Paul Ryan’s Retirement Gives a Big Boost to the Most Prominent White Nationalist in U.S. Politics',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'House Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision to retire from office makes, for the moment, an anti-Semitic white nationalist who has embraced the so-called Alt Right the Republican frontrunner in Wisconsin’s first congressional district. In a Facebook post hailing the news, GOP candidate Paul Nehlen called Ryan’s retirement “good news for America, bad news for special interests who bought Paul Ryan\'s vote. My focus has always been on YOU.” In fact, Nehlen’s focus has not always been on “YOU,” his voters. Previously, his campaign criticized Ryan’s “silence on issues of [Jewish] media representation."The antipathy is apparently mutual. Ryan’s campaign pulled no punches in a statement on Wednesday afternoon. “There are many qualified conservatives who would be effective representatives for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District, and Paul Nehlen isn’t one of them,” said Kevin Seifert, the head of Ryan’s political operation. “His bigoted rhetoric and his reprehensible statements should disqualify him from holding any public office and we are confident voters in Southern Wisconsin feel the same way.”In large part because of his penchant for racially inflammatory or anti-Semitic remarks, Nehlan’s political prospects have not been taken all that seriously. Ryan defeated him by nearly 70 points in the 2016 Republican primary and the expectation was that the same would happen again this cycle. With Ryan’s retirement, those expectations change. Nehlen is one of two Republicans who had vied to replace Ryan in 2018, and while other Republicans are likely to jump into the contest before the district’s August primary, Nehlen has more visibility and political experience than his sole existing opponent, Army special forces veteran and businessman Nick Polce. He also is personally wealthy, though local media has investigated his company, Blue Skies Global LLC, and found scant evidence that it does any actual business. Asked by a Milwaukee radio station where Blue Skies pays taxes, Nehlen conceded, "No taxes have been paid so far precisely because nothing has been charged for services to date."With cash to spare and his major primary opponent out of the way, Nehlen is not just a threat to win the nomination, but also is likely to solidify his place as the most prominent white nationalist in U.S. politics today. His brand of politics is so toxic that even Breitbart News, which has previously identified with the Alt Right and provided extensive and favorable coverage to Nehlen, recently disavowed him. And while Nehlen may be running as a Republican, the Wisconsin GOP wants nothing to do with him. “Nehlen and his ideas have no place in the Republican Party,” a state party spokesperson said in February, shortly after Nehlen tweeted out a racist image of Meghan Markle, the biracial actress slated to marry Prince Harry next month.For that tweet, Nehlen was banned from the platform. But he found other ways to muse about race and politics online. He joined Gab, a Twitter alternative popular among the Alt Right. Last week, however, he was banned from that platform too.Nehlen’s travails on social media have inspired him to make online censorship the cornerstone of his policy platform. He proposes to “extend Americans’ First Amendment free speech protections onto major social media platforms,” though he insists that such a move would not require a constitutional amendment.Nehlen hails from the Trumpian wing of the Republican Party. And he rode hard on the president’s coattails during his thoroughly unsuccessful 2016 run. But last year, Nehlen took a hard turn even further right, embracing the personalities, affectations, and bigoted racial, religious, and political views of the country’s resurgent white nationalist community.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The piece, written by the site’s founder, Andrew Anglin, alleged a “Jewish policy of using violence, intimidation and threats of financial ruin to silence criticism of them.” Anglin added, “it simply is not controversial that America is run by Jews to the detrainment of the overwhelming majority of the American people.”On Easter, Nehlen shared a photoshopped image of himself sitting at the Oval Office desk surrounded by the severed heads of a group of Hasidic Jews.Though Nehlen has appeared on radio programs hosted by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other Alt Right leaders, his blatant anti-Semitism has been too much for some in the movement. Last month, Jared Taylor, the leading of white nationalist group American Renaissance, disinvited Nehlen from a conference the group was hosting.Nehlen further drew the Alt Right’s ire last week when he revealed the identity of a racist pro-Trump troll who goes by the name Ricky Vaughn. Nehlen’s “doxing” of Douglass Mackey, the man behind Ricky Vaughn, is was precipitated his banishment from Gab.That’s left Nehlen with few allies even in the fringe corners of the right-wing fever swamps where he was once hailed as a hero. But Nehlen’s political allies continue to make inroads in some corners of the political right. Former Nehlen campaign consultants recently acquired a right wing news website, Big League Politics, that they have used to advance the political interests of their current and former clients, including Nehlen, former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, and Virginia Senate candidate Corey Stewart.'},
 {'title': 'Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian Intelligence Officer. Does That Mean Trump Team Colluded?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The link between Russia and the Trump campaign that special counsel Robert Mueller has been looking for may finally have materialized.\xa0 On Friday, The Daily Beast reported that the hacker of the Democratic National Committee emails known as “Guccifer 2.0” is, in fact, a Russian intelligence officer. The Daily Beast further reported that Mueller has brought onto his team the FBI investigator who tracked down the intelligence officer. Reportedly, Guccifer 2.0 inadvertently revealed his identity by failing to conceal his use of a Russian computer server on one occasion. Although the intelligence community had speculated that Guccifer 2.0 was Russian, until now, that fact had not been publicly confirmed.\xa0 This news is significant for what it could mean to the Mueller investigation.\xa0 When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, he tasked him to investigate the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2106 presidential election, including: (1) links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; (2) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and (3) any other matters within the scope of the governing regulation, such as perjury or obstruction of justice. The news regarding Guccifer 2.0’s identity could be the key to the first item on that list. One individual associated with the Trump campaign was Roger Stone, who served as a campaign advisor. Stone has previously admitted to communicating with Guccifer 2.0, who has claimed to be a native Romanian speaker. If the report is accurate, and Guccifer 2.0 is, in fact, a Russian intelligence officer, this could be the crucial link that allows Mueller to charge Stone and any other members of the campaign who assisted Guccifer 2.0. Stone has denied having advance knowledge of the publication of the hacked emails, but, in August 2016, before the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta were released by Wikileaks in October 2016, Stone tweeted that “it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel.”\xa0 His tweet suggested that he knew that Podesta’s emails had been hacked and would be released. What might this mean for Mueller and his team?\xa0 The indictment filed against 13 Russians in February provides a clue. That indictment charged the defendants with what is known as a Klein conspiracy, that is, a conspiracy to defraud the United States.\xa0 A Klein conspiracy is an agreement to impair, obstruct or defeat the lawful functioning of some agency of the federal government. In this case, the affected agency was the Federal Election Commission, among others, in its role to administer federal elections.The February indictment focused on the use of social media to improperly influence the election. Until then, it was unclear whether Mueller would pursue such a theory.\xa0 Now that he has done so in one case, it would not be a stretch to envision another indictment charging the Russian intelligence officer known as Guccifer 2.0 and others under a similar theory based on the hacking of the emails.\xa0 And in addition to charging Guccifer 2.0, Mueller could also charge anyone who conspired with him or aided and abetted him. One feature of the Klein conspiracy theory is that Mueller need not show that the co-conspirators were involved in the hacking, as long as he can show that they agreed that the emails would be disseminated afterwards, since the crime is not based on the computer intrusion, but on the disruption of the election. Besides conspiracy, Stone or other members of the Trump campaign could be charged with aiding and abetting if they assisted or even encouraged either the hacking or the publication of the emails.\xa0 Another potential charge is accessory after the fact for anyone who might have advised how or when to release the emails after they had been hacked. Mueller is likely looking to see whether Stone or other members of the Trump campaign played a role in suggesting the timing of the release of the Podesta emails, which occurred on the same day as the release of the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump spoke in vulgar and disparaging ways about women. The release of the tape was a potentially campaign-ending event for Trump. Instead, that story competed for attention with the story of the Podesta emails.\xa0 Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign member, has recently stated that during questioning by Mueller’s team, he was asked questions about Stone. It seems likely that Mueller is closely examining the relationship between Stone and Guccifer 2.0, which could provide the link he has been seeking to fulfill his mandate. \xa0And if other members of the campaign participated in the decision to release the emails, then they could find themselves named in an indictment along with Guccifer 2.0.'},
 {'title': 'James Comey: John Kelly Called Trump ‘Dishonorable’ for Firing Me',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Within minutes of his firing in May, former FBI Director James Comey received a call from John Kelly, then the head of the Department of Homeland Security and now the White House chief of staff.According to Comey’s account, which is set to appear in his highly anticipated forthcoming memoir, Kelly was “emotional” over the manner in which Comey was let go. The then-FBI director was in California at the time, speaking to FBI agents in Los Angeles, and only found out that he was out of a job when he saw the news break on TV.Kelly, Comey recalls, said he was “sick” about the situation and “intended to quit” in protest. Kelly “said he didn’t want to work for dishonorable people,” referring specifically to President Donald Trump, who appeared to be upset at the FBI’s persistent investigation into his campaign’s possible collusion with Russian officials.According to sources, Comey writes in his book that he encouraged Kelly to remain in his post, saying “this president,” more than his predecessors, needed people of principle and integrity around him.The phone call was first reported by CNN last year. But Comey’s book provides both on the record confirmation and additional details of the conversation. Those details were relayed to The Daily Beast by two sources who have read the book, A Higher Loyalty, prior to its planned release on Tuesday.The revelations conveyed by Comey threaten to cause a firestorm within the White House, further complicating an already tenuous relationship between Kelly and Trump. The chief of staff has been on increasingly thin ice with the president in recent weeks, largely dating back to his disastrous handling of the resignation of Rob Porter, a former White House official accused of beating his former wives. Kelly reportedly told Trump in February that he would resign if asked. And Trump has let it be known to numerous aides and confidants that he feels comfortable operating around (and even without) his chief of staff.“The revelations conveyed by Comey threaten to cause a firestorm within the White House, further complicating an already tenuous relationship between Kelly and Trump.”A senior White House official disputed Comey’s characterization of the phone call with Kelly, saying that Kelly has maintained that the call was brief—roughly a minute long—and that the gist was, “I don’t know why you got fired, [and] best of luck to you,” according to the official. The version of this story that Kelly has told other senior staffers clashes markedly with Comey’s, the official noted, and does not include Kelly calling President Trump “dishonorable.”Comey appears to be pulling no punches in either his book or in sit-downs promoting it. According to Axios, he compared Trump to a mob boss in an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos slated to air on Sunday. One of the sources who described Comey’s account of Kelly’s phone call said the former FBI director’s book is filled with anecdotes that will potentially upset a president already seething over the persistence of the investigation into Russian election-meddling that Comey once led. The recounting of Kelly’s phone call, the source said, “reflects a larger theme of the book and the Trump administration—how hard it is for ethical people to stay in close proximity to bullies who lack integrity and honor.”Anticipating an unfriendly portrayal, White House allies are ramping up a counteroffensive designed to push back on the book and Comey’s accompanying media tour. The Republican National Committee has taken the lead in the effort. The Trump White House is not amassing an official rapid-response operation, reportedly due to internal concerns that the president would quickly undermine official talking points by directly responding to Comey’s claims and public utterances. But White House officials told The Daily Beast that their strategy regarding the book and the Comey tour will be largely shaped in real-time, forming and adjusting to accommodate however publicly and furiously Trump reacts.“What’s dishonorable is that James Comey lied about leaking information to the media, consistently contradicted himself in testimony, and made a series of bizarre decisions as FBI director,” RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens told The Daily Beast on Thursday morning. “That’s why Republicans and Democrats alike have said he has no credibility.”Loyalists and associates of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee who has her own rocky history with Comey, are also doing their part to push back on what they expect will be a poor portrayal of the former secretary of state. Some confidants are demanding concessions that Comey is unlikely to make.

 {'title': 'Carter Page’s Multimillion-Dollar Dream',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Carter Page is a Rosencrantzian go-between who makes few but intriguing appearances in the ongoing drama of Mad King Donald. Trump might well say of him, as Hamlet said of Rosencrantz and his doppelgänger Guildenstern, that he is “not near my conscience.”But a news report from Moscow recently about a Chinese government investment casts new light on how the Russian government sought to engage with candidate Trump. The Russian business newspaper Vedomosti wrote that two state-controlled Chinese companies have become major shareholders in CEFC, a nominally private Chinese oil company that is acquiring a large stake in Russia’s huge state-owned oil company, Rosneft. Through this maneuver, the Chinese state now owns about 15 percent of Rosneft. Vedomosti did not note that Page features as a character in what has been a long-running Rosneft drama. It’s a story of a privatization deal gone bad, and a feckless American intermediary whose only credential seems to be his peculiar presence in the court of the Mad King.Over the past two years, that big chunk of Rosneft has had a tortuous journey. In July 2016, the British ex-spy Christopher Steele, in his so-called dossier, reported to his client, Fusion GPS, that Page had met earlier that month in Moscow with Rosneft’s CEO Igor Sechin. Sechin, according to Steele’s source, offered Page a commission if he could place the Rosneft shares with a foreign buyer. For many months, Page, already on the FBI’s radar for having met with Russian faux diplomats trying to recruit him, denied meeting with Sechin or any other Russian officials. Finally, before the House intelligence committee, he did admit to meeting with Sechin’s number two, head of investor relations Andrey Baranov.On the face of it, the offer seemed preposterous. Sechin, a close ally of Putin, a former spy, and one of Russia’s powerhouse leaders, was offering a €10 billion ($11 billion) deal to an obscure, undistinguished, self-styled oil and gas expert. But Page had something else going for him. In 2016, he had become one of Trump’s top five foreign policy advisers. For financial reasons, if no other, Sechin had been tasked by Putin himself to get the Rosneft transaction done. The Russian federal budget had been decimated by low oil prices. Putin needed cash. He also wanted to show Barack Obama and European leaders that Russia was attractive to foreign investors despite the sanctions imposed after the March 2014 seizure of Crimea by Russia’s “little green men.”Russia could sell up to 19.5 percent of its enormous state oil company and still keep control. For Page, who had traveled to Moscow to make a speech, Russian largesse had the potential to put him in the big leagues. If he could find a buyer, even a small finder’s fee would be worth tens of millions of dollars.\xa0This would not have been the only act of Kremlin kindness seen that summer. A month earlier, as is now well-known, a Russian lawyer had offered dirt on Hillary Clinton to candidate Trump’s top advisers at a Trump Tower meeting. The sale happened, or so it seemed, five months later, on Dec. 7, 2016—a month after Trump’s upset victory. Igor Sechin announced that 19.5 percent of Rosneft had been sold to two big investors: a Qatar sovereign wealth fund and Glencore, the Anglo-Swiss commodities trading firm. We do not know if Page played any role in contacting Glencore or the Qatar government, but within 24 hours of Sechin’s announcement, Page—no longer on Trump’s team—was on a flight back to Moscow. Even if he had played no role, the sale opened a window on what Steele’s source had said was the main topic of the Page-Sechin meeting:\xa0Sechin’s offer of “future bilateral energy cooperation and prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia” in a Trump administration. If a major European commodities firm and a Mideast oil producer now owned a big piece of Rosneft, closer Russo-American cooperation on oil issues became feasible. Five days after the sale to Glencore and the Qataris was announced, President Trump appointed an oilman, Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state. The Rosneft deal, described as a 50-50 acquisition, soon went off the rails. Glencore said it had offered only token cash for the transaction. The Qataris, who had reportedly put €2.5 billion into the transaction, said nothing. An Italian bank, Intesa, appeared to be guaranteeing $5 billion on behalf of a Cayman Islands company whose ownership no one would divulge. A Reuters analysis found reason to think that a state-controlled Russian bank had channeled the entire sale through a Singapore shell company.In other words, Putin got the appearance of a private deal for Rosneft, to show he could withstand sanctions, but the deal as presented was at best murky. Fortune wondered aloud whether Russian state-controlled institutions were the real purchasers—in a back-door arrangement that would, if exposed, cause the ruble to collapse.To show his appreciation for their contribution to “strengthening cooperation with Russia,” in 2017 April Putin bestowed state medals upon the Qatari leader, Glencore’s CEO, and the head of Intesa Bank. But five months later, the deal came undone. The three named financial participants abandoned the pretense that they wanted to invest in Rosneft. Then, in September, Sechin announced that Glencore and the Qataris were selling the bulk of their shares—$9 billion-worth—to a Chinese firm, the China Energy Corporation (CEFC). CEFC is one of the largest “private” companies in China, and one of the most closely held. Given the back-alley character of the transaction, it is unclear whether the sellers realized any gain.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Multilateral organizations, including the International Monetary Fund, were pressing Putin to privatize state companies. The new Chinese owners might have passed the privatization test—until two weeks ago, when the takeover of CEFC by two state-controlled Chinese companies was reported.\xa0One report suggests that CEFC’s head was looting the company and did not have the cash to buy the Rosneft shares. The Chinese government stepped in.China’s Ministry of Finance, in combination with a state-controlled insurance company, will become owners of more than one-third of CEFC’s shares, giving the Chinese government effective control over the Rosneft shares, and with that, a major voice in Rosneft decision-making. Rosneft shares traded in the London market moved down sharply in late February, perhaps on rumors of the impending deal.Now back to Carter Page. Why was this man, described by his Russian handlers as “an idiot,” offered any role whatsoever in this transaction, let alone a fee likely to run into the tens of millions of dollars? In retrospect, it seems clear that Sechin was desperate to find a partner to buy Rosneft shares. Putin needed the appearance of a privatization deal to prove he was invulnerable to sanctions. No Western investment bank would buy Rosneft shares, no matter how lucrative the package. Sechin had run out of options. As unimpressive as Page was, he was apparently worth a try.Moreover, no matter how minimal his qualifications, Page simultaneously fit another bill: He was a conduit to Trump, helping to support Russia’s efforts to undermine Hillary Clinton and to install in Washington an American government friendly to Russia. The Russians were probing for multiple access points to Trump. They had seated the testy, mercurial Gen. Michael Flynn at Putin’s side during December 2015 festivities in Moscow. Page’s appointment to the Trump foreign policy team gave Russia another point of entry into Trump’s entourage. Sechin would seem to have had no other reason to deal with Page in the first place—unless Sechin thought that discreet coordination with the United States on oil and gas production, along the lines of\xa0OPEC production quotas that Putin had negotiated, was possible, and that Page could start that discussion. For Russia, the stakes were very high, and however unlikely a player Page appeared to be, he might be useful. Ukraine’s break with the Kremlin threatened control over gas transit lines through Ukraine to Europe and forced Russia to make massive pipeline investments. If Russia were to lose its dominance in supplying Europe with gas, it might find itself courting domestic political crisis. Shoring up Rosneft’s oil revenues and with it the state budget was a high priority; taking a chance on a Page connection would be low-risk.Russia’s oil-and-gas strategy continues to stumble along. Rosneft’s privatization, likely a Potemkin facade, has ended with China likely controlling a major chunk of Russian oil. Carter Page’s dream of a transcendent payday was a bubble that burst. As Guildenstern might have said, “the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.”Steven E. Halliwell was Citibank corporate finance head for the former Soviet Union and CFO of several investment funds for Russia.

 {'title': 'Diamond & Silk Are Now Practically ‘Senior Advisers’ to the President Through the TV',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "At a time when President Donald Trump is eager to surround himself with supportive television personalities, he’s taken a particular liking to a pair of YouTube stars known for, among other things, a pro-Trump, anti-Eminem rap song titled “Trump’s Yo President.”Diamond & Silk are not your prototypical Trump boosters. They are African-American women who have relied on the internet for their rise to fame (or infamy, depending on your political posture). They are known, predominantly, for their direct-to-camera, impassioned defenses of the president—and acid-tongued takedowns of his critics. But in recent weeks, the two have had a growing presence on Fox News, which has, in turn, put their commentary squarely on Trump’s radar. And, according to White House officials, he’s impressed. Within the halls of the White House, Trump has repeatedly commented to aides over the past several months about how much he enjoys catching Diamond & Silk on TV, referencing specific clips and interviews they’ve done on shows such as Fox & Friends or Hannity, two West Wing officials and an outside Trump ally tell The Daily Beast.According to those close to the president, Trump finds their unabashedly loyalty, as well as their style and flair, “fantastic.”Officials could not, however, confirm if Trump had seen the “Trump’s Yo President” rap.Lynette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson initially gained prominence for their “Stump for Trump” YouTube videos. Their vociferous, comically flamboyant support for Trump—and willingness to defend his racially divisive rhetoric—went viral during the 2016 campaign, earning them spots opening up for Trump before his campaign rallies.In recent months, they have all but disappeared from all of the major networks—except Fox News. At the network, they remain relatively small players. One person familiar with Fox News’ online traffic said that the duo are not mentioned during Fox News daily traffic meetings alongside high-performing conservative pundits like contributor Tomi Lahren. They also lack strong relationships with many of the top brass, owing, in part, to the fact that they generally don’t appear during segments with other guests and typically appear remotely.Several prominent on-air personalities at Fox News reached by The Daily Beast said they were either unaware of who they were, or did not think much of their appearances on the network.But Diamond & Silk do have key ties to some of Fox News’ biggest players, several of whom enjoy strong relationships with Trump. They’re favorites of Trump fanboy Jesse Watters, who has plugged their website on air and had them on his weekend show almost every week this year. They also are increasingly booked on Fox & Friends, where they sound off about the news of the day.In part because of those appearances, the two have become a social fixture in the larger Trump universe. Though president has been tweeting about or at them since at least December 2015—dubbing them “two amazing women” and “two truly fantastic women!”—the pair now find themselves regularly invited to high-profile Trump parties, including events at the White House and even Lara Trump’s baby shower. One senior Trump administration official joked to The Daily Beast that Diamond & Silk could double as “senior economic advisers to” the president, citing, among other clips, a Fox & Friends segment in which the pair declared that “black unemployment is low and home ownership is high” in the Trump era.“We’ve been on this ride for a long time, but they… one of the first that [were] out there,” says Mark Burns, a pro-Trump black pastor and congressional contender who, like Diamond & Silk, hit the 2016 trail in support of Trump. “It’s not an act for them. What you see on television is what you see privately… That’s one of the reasons why the president has favored them and favored people like myself… There’s not a hidden agenda. They believe, like I do, that the Democratic Party has used the black vote for so long, and has essentially pimped out the black community for votes.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Bill Clinton Dismisses Gillibrand Saying He Should Have Resigned',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'In a new interview set to air this weekend on CBS Sunday Morning, former President Bill Clinton will respond for the first time to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-NY) assertion that he should have resigned over the Lewinsky affair.“You have to—really ignore what the context was,” Clinton says, according to a CBS transcript. “But, you know, she’s living in a different context. And she did it for different reasons. So, I—but I just disagree with her."Gillibrand, who enthusiastically endorsed Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid and has longstanding ties to the Clinton family, told The New York Times last November that the “appropriate response” to the scandal over his White House affair with intern Monica Lewinsky would have been for Bill Clinton to resign.“Things have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction,” Gillibrand continued. “And I think in light of this conversation, we should have a very different conversation about President Trump, and a very different conversation about allegations against him.”Gillibrand has been on the vanguard of confronting sexual harassment as a senator and was one of the first to call for fellow Democratic senator Al Franken’s resignation over allegations of sexual misconduct.A Gillibrand spokesperson went on to clarify that Clinton’s actions should have led him to resign if they occurred in the current era. Speaking about the impeachment proceedings against him two decades ago, Clinton said during the soon-to-air CBS interview: “Well, I knew it wouldn’t succeed. It wasn\'t a pleasant experience. But it was a fight that I was glad to undertake after the elections, when the people had solidly told, by two-thirds or more, the Republicans to stop it. They knew there was nothing impeachable. And so, we fought it to the end. And I’m glad.”'},
 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani Is Trump’s Lawyer, Spokesman, and Now a Top Political Adviser',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Last week, President Donald Trump weighed into a contentious House Republican primary battle, officially endorsing the establishment incumbent over a pugnacious challenger with Trumpian appeal.Among those encouraging the president to throw his weight behind Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) was his newest attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who himself endorsed Donovan’s reelection bid against his primary challenger, former congressman and convicted felon Michael Grimm.“I like both of them,” Giuliani told The Daily Beast, referring to Donovan and Grimm, “but I thought, as did several other people that spoke to the president, that Donovan has a better chance of winning."Trump’s decision to heed Giuliani’s advice and officially endorse Donovan last Wednesday highlights the expanded influence that the former New York City mayor is exerting within the White House orbit. Giuliani has become not just a lead attorney on Trump’s legal team but also a political adviser, a prominent media surrogate, and even an apparent foreign policy spokesman—sometimes to the chagrin of senior administration officials.“Just because I’m acting as his lawyer does not mean we don’t talk about other things,” said Giuliani. "I’m one of his closest friends, I\'ve given him political advice for years.”Giuliani has, indeed, been a long time adviser of Trump’s including the heydays of the 2016 election. But only recently has he had such a direct audience with the president. And he’s proving willing to use his access. The former mayor pleaded Donovan’s case at a small meeting last month, shortly after Trump attended a Long Island event with Donovan and Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), where the president doubled down on his controversial characterization of MS-13 gang members as “animals.”Giuliani said the meeting at which he advised Trump to back Donovan also included “at least three [other] people…giving [Trump] advice of a similar nature” and that it lasted for roughly fifteen minutes. He would not say who else was present, though he noted that King had previously suggested to Trump that he talk to Giuliani about a potential Donovan endorsement. Giuliani had endorsed Grimm during his initial congressional run in 2010, but said he agreed that Grimm’s criminal record would make him less electable this November.Trump’s endorsement of Donovan came less than a month ahead of his primary contest against Grimm, who held the seat before going to prison in 2015 on federal tax evasion charges. Both candidates sought Trump’s endorsement, which carries significant political weight in the Staten Island district. “We expected that from the former mayor of NYC. No surprise,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser who now works on Grimm’s campaign, of Giuliani’s role in steering the president in Donovan’s direction. “The flawed calculus behind the move has been circulating from the RNC to the NRCC to the White House political shop for weeks.”Choosing which House races are worthy of presidential engagement is the sort of advice that would normally come from White House political advisers. But for Giuliani, it’s the latest addition to a portfolio expanding far beyond matters pertaining to the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Trump hired Giuliani to helm his personal legal team in April, and by the following month the ex-mayor quickly became ubiquitous on TV news, in the process becoming a public face on a litany of matters, many unrelated to the Russia investigation.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Giuliani announced the North Korean government’s release of three American prisoners days before the White House confirmed the news. That prompted the State Department to distance itself from Giuliani, with department spokeswoman Heather Nauert stating, “he speaks for himself and not on behalf of the administration on foreign policy.”Even on legal matters, Giuliani has publicly strayed from the federal investigation he was brought on board to handle. In his first major TV appearance as a member of Trump’s legal team, Giuliani weighed in on payments from Michael Cohen, the president’s longtime fixer and attorney, to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for an agreement late in the 2016 campaign to stay quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Giuliani’s comments during that Fox News interview with host Sean Hannity blindsided senior West Wing officials.When Giuliani has stayed within his formal purview, he has often operated in a role more traditionally suited for a spokesman than a legal counselor. Over the weekend, he told ABC’s This Week that President Trump “probably” has the constitutional authority to pardon himself though he had “no intention” of doing so. “The president would be committing political suicide pardoning himself,” he told The Daily Beast, elaborating on those comments. “The practical control on that would be that Congress would impeach him… No way in the world that President Trump is going to do that…He did nothing wrong.”Giuliani’s comments on ABC set off a firestorm in Washington on Monday. But by the next day, he was already halfway around the world. He spoke with The Daily Beast over the phone from Israel, where he is scheduled to speak at the Globes Capital Markets Conference on Wednesday. He said he was talking on issues of cyber security, and that he committed to speak at the conference “months ago.” Later that evening, he was doing another television interview, this time on CNN. The totality of Giuliani’s comments, and his aggressive PR streak, has led former Bill Clinton legal hand Lanny Davis to conclude that the president’s legal strategy is inextricably linked with his political concerns. Davis, who served a similar role to Giuliani’s in the Clinton White House, speculated that what Giuliani was trying to do was to spark an electorally-advantageous debate over impeachment by making broad claims about the president’s legal powers. Republicans, Davis said, “want impeachment to be on the ballot in 2018.” As long as Republicans continue to support the president, “there will never be a bipartisan two-thirds vote [for impeachment] in the Senate. Ergo, everything that Giuliani is doing makes sense if it’s simply, ‘bring it on, try to impeach me.’”'},
 {'title': 'Lawmakers to Trump: We Want a Say in the North Korea Talks',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "An effort is underway on Capitol Hill to give top lawmakers a larger role in President Donald Trump’s endeavor to negotiate a nuclear deal with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, The Daily Beast has learned.The push, which is designed to grant Congress the role of an “observer” in the high-stakes talks, involves resurrecting the responsibilities of an obscure and little-known congressional body known as the Senate Arms Control Observer Group.Today, that body operates as the National Security Working Group (NSWG), a bloc of 20 senators co-chaired by Sens. Jim Risch (R-ID) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Lawmakers want to use the NSWG as a vehicle for direct congressional involvement in the nuclear talks between President Donald Trump and the North Korean dictator.When asked about the NSWG’s efforts, many senators, including members of the foreign relations committee, did not even know that the body existed—neither in its past nor current form. “I haven’t been keeping up with it,” said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), who recounted a trip to Geneva in the late 1980s with the group shortly after it was formed.The NSWG’s internal machinations remain largely secretive. Feinstein told The Daily Beast that the group had recently welcomed guest speakers including Defense Secretary James Mattis to discuss a range of issues. But the group’s official charter notes that senators are authorized to “act as official observers on the United States delegation to any negotiations to which the United States is a party regarding the reduction, limitation, or control” of weapons of mass destruction. And because of that authority, at least one top senator is now making the case that the NSWG would be an ideal conduit for congressional involvement in the North Korea talks.“The desire is for it to be an observer in any negotiations,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told The Daily Beast. “I agreed with Sen. Feinstein and Sen. Risch that I’d be happy because that’s an expanded group that has senior [foreign relations committee] members, senior armed services people, senior intelligence people—so it would be a good group. And we’ll see whether we can get the administration to agree.”Established in a bipartisan fashion during the height of the Cold War in 1985, the Senate Arms Control Observer Group was envisioned as a way to essentially give Congress a seat at the table on the front end of negotiations with the Soviet Union. The group was created so that lawmakers could exercise more than simply the routine oversight conducted by the foreign relations committee by giving senators a seat at the table during the executive branch’s arms-control negotiations. Its relevance began to fade during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations as nuclear-related issues were overtaken by other, more pressing foreign-policy matters.With Trump’s highly anticipated summit with Kim coming on June 12 in Singapore, some lawmakers want to bring back the working group’s initial model to ensure that the White House stays true to certain commitments—chief among them, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s promise to not lift U.S. economic sanctions until North Korea’s nuclear program is dismantled beyond reversal. Other lawmakers, however, worry that Congress might throw the White House off if it engages too directly. In particular, some believe that with the negotiations in their nascent stages, the legislative branch should allow traditional committees to have their oversight roles. Already, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has requested staff-level briefings from the State Department and the National Security Council, aides from both sides of the panel said. And Micah Johnson, a spokeswoman for Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), the chairman of that committee, said members will “conduct appropriate oversight,” and added that committee hearings and member-level briefings could come eventually. Corker is also in regular contact with Pompeo.Risch, who is next in line to become chairman of the foreign relations committee and has largely supported Trump in the foreign-policy realm, did not appear to be enthusiastic about the prospect of the NSWG stepping in at such an early stage.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Obviously, that is an opportunity we have for oversight,” the senator told The Daily Beast when asked about the NSWG’s efforts. “This whole thing is fluid at this point. The president has been doing really well on this, and we want to see him continue to do that.”The degree to which Congress does end up demanding a role in any North Korea deal has potentially massive consequences on the success of the deal itself. Just last week, many Republican lawmakers and foreign-policy officials criticized former President Barack Obama for not having involved lawmakers enough in his own nuclear deal with Iran. Specifically, a common complaint was that the Iran deal would have withstood Trump’s successful attempt to nullify it had it been ratified by the Senate.Ratification, of course, comes only after a deal is reached by the parties involved. Trump and Kim are not yet at that point. In public and in private, senators fret that the negotiations are delicate. They’re also urging caution even as the Kim regime offers to dismantle a nuclear test site and, more recently, released three American prisoners.“These are developments that are critical to understanding what happens after a successful June 12 meeting. But there’s a lot that can happen between now and then,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), a member of Republican leadership and a member of the foreign relations panel, said in an interview. “If the president believes that there is no path forward on denuclearization—and by that, I mean complete, verifiable, irreversible decluearization—the meeting shouldn’t even occur.”Anything beyond routine oversight as negotiations are ongoing is also likely to be met with stiff resistance from the Trump administration. Marc Short, the White House legislative affairs director, told The Daily Beast that Pompeo would remain “in regular contact” with lawmakers about North Korea, but declined to discuss the possibility of an expanded role for the legislative branch.Presidents have historically balked at congressional involvement in foreign-policy matters. Obama vigorously opposed legislation, crafted in part by Corker, aimed at giving Congress more oversight and input into the Iran nuclear deal after it was negotiated. The resulting bill passed in the Senate with 98 votes.The Trump administration might have reasons to be concerned about congressional involvement, said a former top aide to John Kerry, who as secretary of state negotiated the terms of the Iran nuclear deal which Trump effectively scrapped last week.“There would certainly be fear that that the Hill would leak or spoil the environment for sensitive talks,” said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for New American Security. “On the other hand, we’ve seen from the Iran deal that these types of deals require congressional and bipartisan buy-in. And without it they can die. So this could be a good idea to address that problem.”"},
 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani, the Mob-Buster, Now Sounds Like a Mob Mouthpiece',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The listening device was still planted in a Mafia capo’s Jaguar when a reporter shocked an organized-crime prosecutor by saying that then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani had told him all about it.And Giuliani was still the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan when he took a group of reporters through a list of public officials, saying which were targeted for imminent indictment.And, in one of Giuliani’s big public-corruption cases, federal Judge Whitman Knapp noted that the defense “has amassed a considerable body of evidence suggesting that one or more employees of the Department of Justice have violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e) by disclosing evidence that was presented to the grand jury.”The judge in this 1986 prosecution of Bronx Democratic leader Stanley Friedman further observed: “It may well be that the Attorney General of the United States would be interested in ascertaining which of his employees was engaged in violating one of the statutes he or she was sworn to uphold, or the Congress might deem such an inquiry appropriate.”To be fair, the judge did not personally accuse Giuliani of the leaks. The late, great reporter Wayne Barrett once noted that Giuliani’s style was to have one of his assistants do it.“He was very careful,” Barrett once allowed. “But people in his office would show you things that were completely illegal.”Giuliani seemed to have forgotten all that when he declared on the Sean Hannity show this week that neither he nor his assistants had ever leaked during his days as a prosecutor.“Never leaked a damn thing,” Giuliani said. “I would have considered resigning if I ever did that, or if one of my assistants did it.”Giuliani made this proclamation immediately after saying that former FBI Director James Comey should face jail time for supposed leaks.“Comey should be prosecuted for leaking confidential FBI information when he leaked his report intended to develop a special prosecutor for the president of the United States,” Giuliani said.Giuliani also accused Comey of telling numerous lies, including when recounting his conversations with President Trump. \xa0“I know James Comey. I know the president,” Giuliani said. “Sorry, Jim, you’re a liar, a disgraceful liar.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Giuliani said this in defense of President Trump, who is estimated by The Washington Post to have made more than 3,000 false or misleading statements since assuming office. Giuliani proceeded to reveal that Trump had also been lying when he said he knew nothing about the $130,000 payment that his personal lawyer Michael Cohen had made to Stormy Daniels.“They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it,” Giuliani said.The firm being Cohen’s one-lawyer outfit. Hannity was named in federal court last month as one of its three clients. “Oh. I didn’t know that,” Hannity said, clearly surprised by Giuliani’s revelation regarding the funneling. “He did?”“Yes,” Giuliani replied.That Giuliani seemed so untroubled by the lie about money should come as no surprise. He had already proven shockingly undisturbed by Trump’s lies about a day that was surely seared into the former mayor’s very soul.Trump has claimed he lost “hundreds of friends” on Sept. 11, 2001, but has yet to name a single one. He was not reported to have been seen at any of the funerals, even though he lives just up the street from Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, where so many were held. Trump has also claimed that he viewed news footage that day of “thousands and thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey cheering the attack. Nobody else seems to have seen it live or filmed.Trump has also spoken of standing at his apartment window and possessing such remarkable eyesight that he could see the jumpers pitch themselves from the burning towers four miles downtown.On his part, Giuliani actually had lost some dear friends and had started out close enough to the towers to see the jumpers all too clearly. Giuliani had then retreated uptown to the quarters of Engine 24 and Ladder 5, which he had first visited in 1994 after three of its members were fatally injured in a fire. Among those present in the wake of that tragedy seven years before 9/11 was FDNY Chaplain Mychal Judge. The firefighters had left their lockers open and Giuliani began slamming them closed, lest the priest see the nude pinups inside. “It’s all right,” Judge said. “It keeps them relaxed.”Giuliani and Judge struck up a friendship and the mayor closely studied the way the chaplain handled the grieving families after the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996. Giuliani also sought out Judge’s advice when his personal life became a tabloid scandal.“Pray for me,” Giuliani would say in late-night phone calls.“No, no, no,” Judge would reply. “God hears from me all the time. I’m sure he’s tired of it. But he would love to hear from a real sinner.”On 9/11, Judge’s lifeless body was carried from the towers and he was officially recorded as the first fatality of the attack. Giuliani put to work everything he had learned from watching Judge after Flight 800, and Oprah Winfrey deemed him “America’s mayor.”Giuliani subsequently had notions of becoming America’s president, but that fizzled. He ended up a big-time booster of Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations. The extent of Giuliani’s descent became clear on the 15th anniversary of 9/11.At the ceremony, Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie excitedly accompanied Trump at ground zero like a pair of outsize Pekinese lap dogs. Christie was just what you might expect. He had been seen yukking it up at a previous observance with a crony who had just contrived to shut down access to the George Washington Bridge as political payback to the mayor of Fort Lee. But Giuliani’s behavior shocked some\xa0of us who had loved Mychal Judge along with others who perished in this place made holy by their sacrifice. How could he be in such obsequious attendance to a guy who had repeatedly lied about 9/11?Giuliani had either sold his soul or it was fully eclipsed by ambition.When Trump was elected, Giuliani seemed to have several big jobs that were his for the asking; attorney general, secretary of homeland security, director of national intelligence. Giuliani declined. The position he sought was apparently the one he was about to name during the interview with Hannity.“I wanted to be secretary…” he began.He stopped before actually saying that his hope had been to become secretary of State, America’s Statesman. He had apparently been judged too temperamental for that spot and he seemed to wilt with disappointment in the subsequent months. He had nonetheless continued to prove himself morally malleable enough to inhabit Trump’s world, representing a Turkish gold trader accused of conspiring to evade U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.A fortnight ago, Giuliani joined Trump’s defense team. Giuliani was back.“I think I’m there because I’m his friend,” Giuliani said to Hannity this week of the man who almost certainly lied about losing hundreds of friends on 9/11.Giuliani’s own past as an oft-accused leaker did not stop him from then calling for Comey to be prosecuted for being a leaker. Giuliani also branded Comey a liar for offering an account backed by contemporaneous notes that differ from the account of the most prolific liar ever to occupy the Oval Office.Giuliani then offered an account of the Stormy Daniels hush money that marked Trump all the more a liar. Giuliani was apparently seeking to establish that the money involved was Trump’s own and not campaign funds.“A settlement payment, which is a very regular thing for lawyers to do,” Giuliani said. “The question there was, the only possible violation there would be was it a campaign-finance violation, which usually would result in a fine by the way, not this big stormtroopers coming in, breaking down his apartment and breaking down his office.”That from a former prosecutor who once had a Wall Street executive handcuffed at his office and marched in tears past his co-workers without securing an indictment, or ultimately proof of any crimes. Giuliani now calls the FBI agents “stormtroopers” even though he knows they must have offered a judge considerable probable cause to believe Cohen had committed what the court papers term “many crimes.” Investigators had to do that to secure a warrant to put a bug in the Jaguar owned by Sal Avellino, Mafia capo. FBI agents certainly would have to do at least that and probably much more to secure a search warrant for the home and office of Michael Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer.In interviews and in his book, Comey has said that Trump’s demand for loyalty reminded him of a mob boss. Giuliani, the onetime mob-buster, has now ended up speaking like a mob mouthpiece.As Giuliani should have learned when he did not get the job he wanted, Trump’s notion of loyalty is indeed enough like that of a mob boss that it carries no obligation for the Big Guy to be reciprocal. Some people are a one-way street. Trump is a one-way boulevard.And on this Bigger than Big Boulevard of Lies, Trump and Giuliani may end up proving anew the truth of an old expression:“With friends like these…”"},

He’s too crooked to fail.First, a brief review of the EPA administrator’s misdeeds.He baldly lied to Congress during his confirmation process, saying he didn’t use his private email for public business, when conclusive evidence showed he did. Indeed, he used it to coordinate strategy with Big Oil, which is why he lied about it in his sworn statements. That’s a felony.After the White House denied Pruitt’s request to give two close aides a raise, he did it anyway, exploiting a legal provision meant to hire hydrology experts to instead pay the aides. That’s a misuse of the Safe Drinking Water Act, and perhaps more important, a direct refusal to follow the White House’s instructions.It turns out that one of those aides, Millan Hupp, coordinated Pruitt’s personal housing search in D.C. That’s a violation of government ethics rules. While that search was underway, Pruitt took a below-market rent deal from a lobbyist whose firm was pushing for a controversial gas pipeline (which Pruitt approved). That constitutes an undisclosed gift from the lobbyist to Pruitt.As first reported by The Daily Beast, that lobbyist, Steven Hart, has bankrolled Pruitt’s career for years and even held GOP fundraisers in the townhouse while Pruitt was staying there. Icing on the cake: Taxpayers had to pay Hart $50 a night for the rent deal.And then there’s the money.Pruitt has racked up over $118,000 in first-class air travel in 2017, whining that our “toxic” political climate means that people aren’t nice to him in coach. (Ironically, some of the people being mean to Pruitt are affected by actual toxic chemicals that Pruitt’s EPA has chosen not to regulate.) He’s spent $58,000 of that taxpayer money flying back and forth from Oklahoma, where he is rumored to be mulling a Senate run. Pruitt even managed to insult House Republicans by failing to turn over his travel documents to them on time.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

He spent $40,000 to fly to Morocco to promote natural gas exports.And $43,000 on a soundproof phone booth in his office. And $800,000 (and counting) for a ’round-the-clock security detail that even went with Pruitt’s family to Disney World.“Pruitt’s corruption isn’t about a single quid-pro-quo. It’s about long-term relationships that Trump himself needs.”He tried to spend $120,000 of taxpayer money to hire a shady PR firm that has targeted journalists, until news of that idea broke and the contract was canceled.Just one of these offenses is enough for Trump to yell “You’re fired.” Former HHS secretary Tom Price, for example, was forced out after spending $51,887 of taxpayer funds on charter planes—a fraction of Pruitt’s first-class bills.So why is Trump yelling “We’ve got your back” instead? Why is Pruitt different?Easy: Follow the money.Pruitt’s not just faithfully executing Trump’s promises to roll back regulations. He’s the conduit between Trump and the fossil fuel industry. Remember, Pruitt, when he was attorney general of Oklahoma, cut and pasted a letter drafted for him by Devon Energy onto his own stationery. As described in an in-depth New York Times report, Devon has since “partnered” with Pruitt to roll back a host of environmental rules, particularly governing methane and fracking, and in exchange, has poured money into the campaign chests of numerous Republicans.So have Chevron, Shell, Koch Industries, and the American Petroleum Institute. Of course, Pruitt has already provided Big Oil with an outstanding return on investment. A 90 percent reduction in demands to power plants to conform to clean air rules. Seven hundred employees forced out of EPA, with no replacements named. Regulations nullified. The historic Clean Power Plan scrapped. Discussions of climate change banned. Scientists fired, replaced by industry yes-men.But these plums are just the short-term rewards. Long term, Pruitt is the key link between the Trump administration and Big Oil. As shown in another New York Times exposé, he meets with industry representatives all the time, more than with any other constituency, and often behind closed doors. Pruitt’s corruption isn’t about a single quid-pro-quo. It’s about long-term relationships that Trump himself needs.Pruitt also has his own funding connections. As revealed by the nonprofit MapLight, Pruitt is the former chairman of the “Rule of Law Defense Fund,” which was bankrolled by more than $750,000 in conservative dark money, funneled through the Judicial Crisis Network (itself a creature of the dark money group Wellspring Corporation), the Rule of Law Project, and Koch brothers-affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce. These players are not Robert Mercer. They’re not Trump diehards, with the possible exception of JCN, originally the brainchild of Jay Sekulow, now Trump’s attorney. Indeed, many of them—like the Koch brothers—were once opposed to Trump. They are fairweather fans, and right now Pruitt is their team’s franchise player. Now you can see why Pruitt has, thus far, has survived, even though men have been fired for far lighter offenses. Trump can’t afford to fire him. Pruitt is just too corrupt to fail.But there may be a way out.Robert Murray, the CEO of Murray Energy, donated $300,000 to Trump’s inauguration. Murray Energy just donated $1 million to Trump’s super PAC. Last year, Murray wrote a now-infamous memo listing 16 specific regulations he wanted rolled back by various agencies. All 16 have been or are being rolled back. Murray’s leading lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, is now No. 2 at Pruitt’s EPA. If Pruitt goes, Wheeler appears next in line. He’s also a long-term climate denialist, and, to boot, a big fan of Milo Yiannopoulos. And he’s got the same caliber of corporate connections as Pruitt.So if Pruitt truly has to go, Wheeler can step into his shoes. In Trump’s world, no one is truly irreplaceable."},

  'body': 'Environment Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt faced mounting pressure to resign on Sunday, amid new reports of alleged ethical violations.The embattled Pruitt, who has come under fire for his lavish travel expenses on the federal government’s dime, is taking heat from lawmakers and some allies of President Donald Trump after it was reported that he rented space in a Washington, D.C. property owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist.“If Mr. Pruitt’s going to go, it’s because he never should have been there in the first place,” former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Trump ally, said on ABC’s This Week. “Listen, I don’t know how you survive this one.”The EPA, through a spokesman, has dismissed suggestions that Pruitt’s condo arrangement represented an illegal gift even though Pruitt paid below the market value. The lobbyist, J. Steven Hart, was doing business with clients involving the EPA, and the Hart family financially backed Pruitt when he was a political candidate.But on Capitol Hill, some have already called on Pruitt to step down or be fired, citing a string of alleged ethical violations since assuming office last year.“I think he’s in real trouble. I think that there is a perception is not good at all. The fact that he has a controversy with expenses, which I think is one of the things that people are just frustrated with, with cabinet members who seem to want to use taxpayer dollars to fund a life, their own personal lifestyle,” Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) said on This Week. “It just looks so bad. And I think it seems that he may be on his way out.”Pruitt has also drawn the ire of congressional Republicans. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, had requested that the EPA hand over documents relating to Pruitt’s travel expenses. The agency blew past the deadline, March 6, to submit those documents.CNN reported on Friday that White House officials were “exasperated” with Pruitt and weren’t preparing just yet to publicly come to his defense. The Trump administration has dealt with similar controversies involving a handful of other cabinet secretaries over the past 14 months, including ousted Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who resigned in September.Christie, who briefly chaired the president’s transition team before he assumed office last January, said the vetting process for prospective nominees during the transition period was “brutally unprofessional.”He was critical of Trump’s other choices for top positions in the administration, including the selection of Michael Flynn for national security adviser. Flynn has since been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and has pleaded guilty.'},
 {'title': 'Seth Abramson’s Metamodernism Preceded His Resistance',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Editor’s Note: This article has been updated throughout.If you’re a liberal or left-leaning person who uses the internet even in a casual way, you likely already know the name Seth Abramson, the professor and writer who’s emerged as one of the super-tweeters of the online #Resistance. More than half of his nearly half a million Twitter followers started following him in the last year. Abramson uses his social media presence cannily as a way to ensure his name remains in the news and in print, counting Mark Hamill and Jeff Merkley among his dedicated fans, and has been credulously quoted recently in outlets including The Wrap, the New York Daily News, The Washington Post, and Vanity Fair.The popular twitter personality who’s often been referred to in mainstream publications as a \xa0conspiracy theorist has managed to expand his platform so rapidly in no small part by relentlessly and exhaustively tweeting about Donald Trump and Russia—promising liberals that our national nightmare will be over just as soon as Robert Mueller’s investigation wraps up.What sets Abramson apart from the even more ridiculous liberal Russia-mongers that have proliferated under this administration—such as Eric Garland or Louise Mensch—is how he \xa0uses his professional credentials to bolster his otherwise over-the-top arguments.Yet a review of his CV shows that he lists as “citations” articles in which he is not even quoted, including a story at Slate that refers to him in passing as one of the people behind “insane liberal conspiracy theories.” He cites a piece at The New Republic, “The New Paranoia,” that mocks a few of his tweets.His C.V. also lists the same story, “Fans Want Alec Baldwin to Attend White House Correspondents’ Dinner as Trump,” six times, citing the story’s publication on four separate Canadian radio stations.Abramson did not respond to requests for comment on the inclusion of the above in his exhausting, but evidently not exhaustive, 33-page C.V. that includes “selected” articles and media appearances.In a HuffPost blog from 2015, Abramson pretended to be a scholar whose work Abramson later “translated” for the audience. That deception was then explained away in a line in a subsequent blog post—“not, by any definition, a hoax; it’s a well-researched article intentionally misattributed to a fictional author.” The impersonation had not, at press time, been noted in the original post.Abramson, a former public defender, is this semester teaching 21st Century Journalism, Professional and Technical Writing, and a Creative Writing Workshop. The first word of his Twitter bio, however, is “attorney,” and he frequently refers to himself “as an attorney” while discussing his Trump-Russia theories (he rarely mentions that when he was a practicing attorney a decade ago, he didn’t practice this kind of federal law—he was a public defender) all while encouraging his Twitter followers “to contribute to my research and writing” through PayPal donations.“I have done nothing wrong,” Abramson wrote in an email on Jan. 8. “I have not misrepresented myself or my credentials.”Abramson wasn’t always known for his political views and theories. He mainly blogged about philosophy and poetry before he started writing about the 2016 Democratic primary and the general election.As a HuffPost blogger in 2016, Abramson earned a reputation for telling his audience what they wanted to hear was really happening in the political sphere. His writing does drive no small amount of engagement, in part because he pushes irresistibly seductive arguments—like when he wrote, ahead of the 2016 Democratic convention, an article headlined “Bernie Sanders Is Currently Winning the Democratic Primary Race, and I’ll Prove It to You.” The popularity of his pieces on politics helped Abramson find a new audience after Trump’s surprise win: The frenzied Russian conspiracy movement blowing up online.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.A cursory glance at Abramson’s social media feeds reveals his dogged dedication to pursuing the Russia story, which he regularly covers in threads that run hundreds of tweets long—a dedication that began just over a month after the 2016 election on his blog and moved almost exclusively over to social media after one final blog on the matter in February.Social media is the cornerstone of Abramson’s media presence. His large Twitter following gives him a platform to spread his TRUMP RUSSIA COLLUSION PUTIN INDICTMENT COMING message. It’s so central to his brand that Abramson includes his Twitter verification on his CV, listed under “Fellowships and Honors.”Abramson often uses his academic and legal credentials to back up his complex theories. However, despite the voluminous credentials, Abramson is less a legal professional than he is simply academically adjacent to the work. Abramson’s academic CV is a full 33 pages—and, until a few months ago, exhaustively documented whenever a single tweet was included in someone’s article, along with statistics on how many Facebook “likes” and “shares” each of the articles he wrote for various publications had received.While as late as Dec. 18, when this reporter asked about it, Abramson described himself in his Twitter bio as “Attorney. Professor @NofNH (journalism, law), his CV says he has taught some courses in Legal Advocacy and Legal Writing. Abramson, who at no point used the phrases “professor of law” or "law professor" to identify himself,  has since removed the word “law” from both his website and Twitter bios, where he now refers to himself as “Attorney. Professor @UofNH.”Law professor is a specific and rigorously credentialed position that carries with it a certain level of prestige and credibility—so when a casual Twitter user came across someone they saw is a professor (law) claiming he knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump will be impeached, that reader may feel more inclined to believe him.Abramson was a practicing lawyer for at least six years, from 2001 to 2007. But as of 2007, he became an inactive member of the New Hampshire bar, making him unable to try cases or to represent someone in court without paying a small fee to the bar to resume his previous, practicing status.Susan Lakeway, the member records coordinator for the New Hampshire Bar Association, confirmed in an email to The Daily Beast that Abramson is a member of the bar, but said that “in his current status he is not practicing or giving legal advice in any jurisdiction.”When reached by The Daily Beast, Erika Mantz, a spokesperson for the University of New Hampshire, stated unequivocally: “Seth is a tenure track professor in Literary Arts and Studies where he teaches digital journalism, legal advocacy, and legal writing. He is not a professor of law.”Abramson has since removed “law” from both his website and Twitter bios, and now leads them with the more precise “Attorney. Professor @UofNH.”Before he began resisting, Abramson was playing his odd metamodernist games in corners of the literary and arts worlds.Sometimes, those backfired—like when he wrote a poem in 2014 assembled from the sentences Santa Barbara woman-hating spree-murderer Elliot Rodger used in his final YouTube video, and publishing them on the HuffPost two days after the massacre.“A remix of the last words of Elliot Rodger,” Abramson wrote in his introduction to the poem, “it uses every word Rodger spoke in his final YouTube video, and no more.”Reaction was swift and harsh. Abramson’s previous publisher, Omnidawn, wrote that it was “dismayed, disheartened, distressed by Seth Abramson\'s Huffington Post piece” and later announced that it had previously cut ties with him. Days later, the publisher received a cease-and-desist letter from Shia LaBeouf\'s attorney, claiming Abramson had been falsely promoting a book including work from the actor, taken from his Twitter feed. Abramson has said he intended to be “honoring” LaBeouf by including him, and withdrew LaBeouf’s selection as soon as he’d been told the actor no longer wished to be so honored. Abramson later published the-cease-and-desist letter itself in a collection of poetry.Later that month, Abramson wrote a long piece for HuffPost (Parts 1 and 2) citing an Aart Naaktgeboren of the Catholic University of Utrecht, from the journal Eeuw: Cultuur in de Nederlanden in interdisciplinair perspectief. This was a made-up, “metamodernist” journal, he disclosed and explained in the long middle of another of his tedious metamodernist essays on HuffPost. The piece in question, titled “The Metamodernist Manifesto: After Postmodernism (Part III)” unmasks Aart Naaktgeboren as none other than… Abramson himself! As Abramson puts it, “the essay entitled ‘The Metamodern Intervention,’ whose two parts are found here and here, is not, by any definition, a hoax; it’s a well-researched article intentionally misattributed to a fictional author.”Abramson goes on to say that the essay is an experiment in truth and context to “complicate (and thereby interrogate) the importance we attach to speakers rather than content.” The original article, however, still claims the fictional author without any corrective note. It’s a murky view of accuracy and honesty that reveals Abramson believes that the ends justify whatever means it takes to deliver his message.Faced with scrutiny, Abramson hit back.“You are crossing some serious lines,” Abramson said in an email after I asked UNH for comment on his status as a professor of law. He recommended I talk to a third party before pursuing this story further and added that “everything you say and do now—publicly and via backchannel correspondence, with respect to me—is being compiled.”That Abramson has kept playing his “metamodernist” games from his early academic career through his current role as a Trump-Russia \xa0shouldn’t surprise anyone.As long as Trump is in the White House, people who play with words and stories for position and profit will hold sway over the dreams of those liberals willing to accept about any excuse for the Trump presidency and any claim that it’s about to end that doesn’t involve introspection and an honest accounting of the factors that put him there.'},
 {'title': 'Trump: Withdraw Troops From Syria. Trump’s Advisers: F That.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A massive rift opened publicly on Tuesday between President Donald Trump and his senior advisers over the future of the U.S. military in Syria. At stake is whether the so-called Islamic State gets to claw back from the cusp of defeat. As the National Security Council was scheduled to convene Tuesday over the future of the 2,000-troop-strong military presence in Syria, Trump reiterated and expanded upon his desire to withdraw forces “very soon.” “It is time. We were very successful against ISIS. We’ll be successful against anybody militarily, but sometimes it is time to come back home. And we’re thinking about that very seriously,” Trump said on Tuesday at the White House, effectively repudiating now-fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s January declaration that the U.S. will stay in Syria indefinitely.But two of Trump’s most senior advisers on the issue emphasized that the war remains unfinished—and will not be finished even after ISIS’ final redoubts in Syria fall. “We are in Syria to fight ISIS. That is our mission. That mission isn’t over. And we’re going to complete that mission,” Brett McGurk, the State Department’s special envoy for coordinating the war against ISIS, said during a Tuesday afternoon forum at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a mile and a half from the White House.McGurk pointed to two pockets on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq as a “notorious haven” where ISIS remains. Seated beside McGurk was Gen. Joe Votel, commander of U.S. troops in the Middle East. McGurk said he considered the war effort to be about “six to eight months ahead of where we anticipated being.” Asked by Stephen Hadley, George W. Bush’s second national security adviser, if there was a “path to defeating and eliminating ISIS in those remaining areas,” Votel indicated his agreement with McGurk that the war remains incomplete.“I think there’s always a path here, and we certainly have to continue to look at how we work through this,” Votel said. Over 90 percent of ISIS’ self-declared caliphate in northeast Syria was gone, but “there are still some areas where they are present and that we will have to continue to operate on, and the situation continues to become more and more complex,” Votel said, citing Turkey’s capture of the Syrian Kurdish city of Afrin as a development that has “slowed down our operations against ISIS.”“We’re ahead of where we thought we would be, as General Votel said, but we’re not finished. And we have to work through some very difficult issues as we speak… We will get this job done, clearing out those last areas of ISIS,” McGurk emphasized. But both emphasized that clearing ISIS would not represent a responsible end to the war. McGurk prioritized clearing out improvised explosive devices ISIS emplaced over the Syrian landscape, a “critical” mission to permit displaced persons and refugees to return to the areas of eastern Syria where the U.S. operates. “The hard part, I think, is in front of us,” Votel said. “And that is stabilizing these areas, consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes and addressing the long-term issues of reconstruction and other things that will have to be done. Of course there is a military role in this, certainly in the stabilization phase.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation,” Trump said, reiterating his regret that the U.S. did not plunder Iraq of its resource wealth during the 2003-2011 occupation. “We should have kept the oil then. We didn’t keep the oil. So I want to get back and rebuild our nation,” Trump said. "},
 {'title': 'Trump Gang Dragnet Caught a Teen Who ICE Said Looked Like He Was in MS-13. He Wasn’t.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "One late spring evening in 2017, a 16-year-old boy was riding a bike with friends in Brentwood, New York—where he lived with his mother—when Suffolk County police officers arrested and handcuffed him. The boy, a citizen of Honduras, was seized under an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) warrant, accused of being a gang member, and quickly transferred to ICE custody. He was able to call his mother just before he was put on a plane to Washington state, where he was put in a secure shelter run by the Department of Health and Human Services. The problem? According to a federal judge, there’s no evidence he was a member of a gang. Immigrant rights advocates say the boy, identified only as EHE in court documents, is part of a growing number of people with no ties to gangs caught in a dragnet created by President Donald Trump’s anti-gang efforts, policies that he will talk up in an appearance on Long Island Wednesday. Meanwhile, EHE has been released after a federal judge ruled the feds had no hard evidence to hold him. The boy’s arrest on May 30 was just the beginning of a year-long, cross-country process that has left his lawyers fighting for his right to stay in the U.S. His status is currently being fought over in immigration court; ICE is trying to deport him, and his attorneys are looking to keep that from happening.About a week after EHE was put on a plane across the country, officials moved him to another facility in California. Two months after that, they flew him back to New York to put him in another secure facility. This was all because ICE concluded that the boy was gang-affiliated based largely on who he was with and how he looked. But, according to District Judge John Keenan, as first reported by the Long Island publication\xa0Newsday, those observations were not enough to justify taking a teenager away from his mother for almost a year. “At the time of EHE’s arrest, it appears that the only evidence of his involvement with any gang is SCPD’s self-serving observations that his ‘[c]lothing and accessories are indicative of membership in MS-13’ and that he was ‘[r]egularly found associating with confirmed MS-13 gang members,’” the judge wrote in a ruling issued earlier this month. “EHE’s choices of wardrobe and associates do not constitute criminal offenses,” the judge continued,“and EHE has not been charged with one. The complete absence of hard evidence of EHE’s affiliation with MS-13 or any other gang generates the inference that EHE’s arrest was merely a pretext for placing him in detention.” Not to mention, the judge added, the boy had never been arrested before he was shipped to Washington state. Advocates say cases like this one are increasingly common, as ICE works overtime to arrest and deport alleged gang members.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Usually when I’m in court, I make references to Joe McCarthy,” said Rob Robertson, an immigration lawyer from northern Virginia.He said ICE has tried to use teens’ broader social affiliations as grounds for alleging they are gang-affiliated and trying to deport them. For teens with broad social groups, this can be perilous. “If one of the friends is gang-affiliated then all of them will get labeled gang-affiliated,” Robertson said. “They say, Kid A was observed with Kids XYZ, Kids XYZ are convicted of gang activity, therefore Kid A is a gang member. Or it could be clothing. It could be anything. If he’s wearing too much blue he’s a gang member. They’re looking for anything.” A spokesperson for ICE sent The Daily Beast a list of criteria they use to determine if someone is in a gang. “Our agents and officers use an established criteria to determine if someone is a gang member or gang associate,” spokesperson Matthew Bourke said. “Additionally, we would note in a case file whether an individual has been validated as a gang member by a local jurisdiction.” The criteria Bourke sent The Daily Beast includes: Subject has tattoos symbolizing or identifying a specific gang;Subject frequents an area notorious for gangs and/or associates with known gang members;Subject has been seen displaying gang signs/symbols;Subject has been identified as a gang member by a reliable source;Subject has been arrested with other gang members on two or more occasions;Subject has been identified as a gang member by jail or prison authorities;Subject has been identified as a gang member through seized or otherwise lawfully obtained written or electronic correspondence;Subject has been seen wearing gang apparel or been found possessing gang paraphernalia.The ICE spokesperson said people who meet two of those criteria are considered gang members.Anthony Posada of The Legal Aid Society—the organization which helped reunite EHE with his mother—said ICE generally appears to rely on local police departments to determine if someone is gang-affiliated. In New York City, he added, this can cause significant challenges for immigrants. The New York Police Department keeps a secret list of potential gang members. People don’t know if they’re on the list and don’t have a way to get off of it. “It doesn’t require you to have committed any wrongdoing to be entered on it and there’s no way to get off of it,” Posada said. And just being labeled as gang-affiliated can be grounds to start the deportation process, he added. “A lot of them are detained, held in detention facilities, and then summarily processed and deported on these very same allegations,” he said."},
 {'title': 'Democrats Prepare Assault on Trump Over Rising Gas Prices',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Democrats are preparing an aggressive assault on the Trump administration in the coming weeks over the cost of rising gas prices nationally. The campaign will take place from the halls of Congress to outside the Beltway, with committees and lawmakers painting President Donald Trump as having contributed to people’s pain at the pump. Gas prices are up nationally an estimated 56.2 cents over last year’s average and trending upwards. One Senate Democratic aide said the topic would be a theme in the ramp up to Memorial Day —when families hit the road— and it would be framed around the notion that the rise in prices has wiped away any financial gains that middle-income Americans may have seen from the tax cuts passed by Republicans at the end of 2017. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are, additionally, preparing a report on the financial gains accrued by oil and gas companies from that bill as a matter of contrasting it with the rising prices of gas overall."Everyone paying higher gas prices, can thank the GOP for the price hike, and every big oil company executive cashing their paycheck can thank the GOP for the tax break,” said Democratic operative Jesse Ferguson, a veteran of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.Attacks over gas prices are a political perennial, timed to the seasonal hikes that often occurs in the late spring and early summer. Former President Barack Obama was on the receiving end of numerous such campaigns and often dismissed them as electoral theater with no foundational understand of how the oil economy works. In 2008, the Republican National Committee sent tire gauges to reporters labeled "Barack Obama\'s Energy Plan" after then candidate Obama said keeping tires properly inflated would matter as much to current gas prices as additional oil drilling. In early 2012, then-House Speaker John Boehner reportedly told his caucus that rising gas prices would be easy political fodder upon which the Republican Party could seize. That same cycle, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used gas prices against Obama too. “He has not,” Romney said, “pursued policies that convince the world that America is going to become energy secure, energy independent."Democrats are not unaware of the role reversal they’re now engaged in. Some even cop to the cynicism inherent in it. “It’s a summer rite of passage,” said one party operative. “Only now, for the first time in eight years, we can put it solely on them.” But others insist that the context and politics are wildly different than just a few years ago. Much of that is owed to Trump’s past words, which will be a component of the Democratic attack against him. For starters, the president took a victory lap over low gas prices during the Fourth of July weekend in 2017. During the Obama-era,Trump repeatedly insisted that a president had direct influence over the price of gasoline, even calling for Obama’s firing in 2012 over the tags at the pump. “Trump previously claimed he would have tremendous power over higher gas prices but he has failed to fix them,” said Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee. “Soaring prices at the pump more than offset the extremely limited benefits that Republicans claimed the Trump tax gave to working families.”Trump rarely—if ever—bows to accusations of intellectual inconsistency. And it’s unlikely that he would admit he was wrong during the Obama years. A request for comment to the White House was not returned. Aanalysts say that the current hike in prices, like those in the past, are tied largely to a mix of industry maintenance decisions, international economic trends and geopolitics that are largely outside the president’s perview. The chief factor this year appears to be the continued fallout of OPEC’s decision to limit oil production in November 2016—which has fed a steady growth in prices for over a year—and the ripple effects of a robust economy, which has increased gas consumption. But some Trump decisions have had an impact. Sanctions on Venezuela have limited oil exports from that country. The undoing of the Iran nuclear deal, combined with the re-introduction of sanctions, has also made it more difficult for a key source of crude oil to reach the market.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Overall, the biggest piece of this puzzle has to do with OPEC and issues outside the president’s purview and control,” said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. “But certainly one could argue that Trump\'s fiery rhetoric with Iran is not helping to calm frayed nerves when it comes to oil and how those sanctions would impact the price of oil.” Democrats quietly began ramping up their attacks on Trump a few weeks back, with a sprinkling of statements putting the hike in prices at his feet. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) mentioned it during a floor speech on May 14. The Democratic National Committee followed with a note about rising prices in a press release the next day. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) released a report on Monday tying Trump’s “incoherent foreign policy” to “higher premiums for Americans at the pump.” And Senate Democrats put out a compilation of local news clips about the rising prices impacting local consumers.Though it is hardly concrete, data shows some correlation between gas prices and a president’s approval rating, as a memo put together by Wells Fargo noted. At least one Democratic campaign group is going into the field in the coming days to do more polling on the issue. A House Republican campaign official told The Daily Beast that they had not detected voter reaction to the issue yet. But already, Democrats feel as if there are lines of vulnerability for the president. A mid-February survey asked respondents who they believed had the most influence over Republicans in Congress. The first answer was self-evident. Fifty percent of respondents said \xa0“wealthy campaign donors.” Not too far behind, however, were “major oil and gas companies,” which was viewed by 26 percent of the respondents as the group with the most power over GOP lawmakers.

 {'title': 'Don’t Be Confused: Kim Jong Un’s Nuclear Concessions Were a Show of Strength by North Korea',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "With less than a week to go before he sits down with his South Korean counterpart, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made an impressive set of declarations. Following a meeting of the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Central Committee this week, Kim declared, among other things, that North Korea would shut down its nuclear testing site—known as Punggye-ri—and stop testing its intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs).If there’s one thing the North Koreans are good at, it’s messaging and propaganda. Kim’s announcement was published in the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korea’s state-run news media. Importantly, KCNA is intended for consumption by the world outside of North Korea’s borders.With momentum in full-swing toward the summit with Moon Jae-in next week and an eventual, still unscheduled, historic summit planned with American President Donald Trump—the first-ever sit-down between two sitting leaders of North Korea and the United States—Kim has all the incentives in the world to make sure that these meetings come together as planned. If the odds of a Trump-Kim summit stood at 50-50 before Friday’s announcement, they’ve now increased considerably. In fact, Kim has increased the costs considerably for Trump of backing out of a summit.Without equivocating, it’s fair to say that both the declarations on nuclear testing and on halting the tests of ICBMs are significant concessions. Specifically, Kim announced that North Korea will “discontinue nuclear testing” and that the Punggye-ri site will be “dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test [sic].” On ICBMs, Kim simply said that no “inter-continental ballistic rocket test-fire” would take place after April 21, 2018.While significant, we shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that these concessions are being made out of a position of weakness or as a necessary show of bona fide goodwill to South Korea and the United States before the upcoming summits. Kim’s rationale for doing away with the nuclear test site was to underline that North Korea had already successfully come up with the nuclear weapons designs it needed.Though unverifiable, there’s no reason to believe that Kim’s reasoning is flawed or overstated. North Korea has claimed, after its fifth and sixth nuclear tests respectively, to have designed and tested a standardized and compact fission bomb and a city-busting thermonuclear bomb. In fact, North Korea’s sixth nuclear test in September 2017 may have been the largest man-made explosion on Earth since a Chinese thermonuclear test in 1992. Based on seismic readings, that test was also considerably more powerful than any of the devices India and Pakistan—two other nuclear weapons possessors—tested over the course of their six tests each. (Neither country has conducted more test since.)The message on nuclear-testing is clear: Kim Jong Un feels he’s got a pretty good bomb design—two of them, in fact. He’s confident that he can place them on missiles that are credibly threatening enough to give North Korea a powerful deterrent against attack and invasion. Even as President Trump lauds Kim’s decision to “suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site” on Twitter, this context is critical.The ballistic missile moratorium is welcome news, too, but it is not a sign that the threat North Korea poses to the United States will evaporate. Yes, it’s true that North Korea has now shown that it can reliably—let’s say around 50 percent of the time—launch an ICBM capable of delivering a warhead that can survive the heat and stress of atmospheric re-entry. Yes, it would probably need further testing to validate that capability. But despite this, North Korea’s three ICBM tests last year, of two different designs, have given it a credible capability.Freezing ICBM launches, though, will be seen as a bona fide gesture in the United States, where many observers—including yours truly—had suggested that such a freeze could have been a productive outcome of a Trump-Kim summit. Now, North Korea has given this up in advance of a summit. For Kim Jong Un, the big prize all along has been a summit with a sitting U.S. president; the moment he walks into that room with Trump and sits down beside him for talks, nuclear world leader to nuclear world leader, he’ll have a huge propaganda coup.Before getting carried away with Kim’s ICBM testing pause, though, the Trump administration should be ready to deal with the circumstances that brought down the Obama administration’s last serious attempt at diplomacy with North Korea. In 2012, the two countries announced a fairly modest agreement on Feb. 29: North Korea would cease missile launches and nuclear testing activity in exchange for food aid and other carrots.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The ink had hardly dried before North Korea announced that it would be launching a satellite—a move that it framed as a peaceful, non-threatening use of civilian technology. Of course, that wasn’t acceptable to Washington. Turns out, the technology between ICBMs and satellite launchers is pretty similar—at least on the way up. The first ICBM in the world, the Soviet Union’s R7 Semyorka, in fact, went the other way: It was designed to deliver nuclear payloads, but was then modified to deliver Sputnik-1 into orbit. (The R7 ended up seeing far more use as a satellite launcher than an ICBM.)The February 2012 agreement fell apart when the North Koreans kept to their word and launched a satellite launch vehicle. This year, we could see a repeat of that play out. A small but convincing body of evidence points to ongoing work in North Korea toward a more capable satellite launcher based on the engine technology underlying the Hwasong-15 ICBM—North Korea’s most powerful missile. Is the Trump administration ready to deal with North Korea’s rationale for satellite launches? Will these be brought up at a summit with Kim?In the end, Kim’s declarations are designed to keep Trump interested in the summit and they seem to have worked. The president has already enthusiastically declared that he looks forward to the summit with Kim. But the administration needs to start sweating the details on how it’ll take what Kim’s given up here and turn it into a winner of a deal—one with some degree of verifiability.The nuclear test site concession seems big, but Kim’s already pointed out that it’s something of a nothingburger given that North Korea’s done with its bomb designs. Missile moratoria, meanwhile, are meaningless if they’re self-enforced. North Korea’s last self-enforced moratorium in 1999 came crashing down in 2006. Finally, the big D-word—denuclearization—is nowhere to be seen in North Korea’s Friday statement.Even as the odds of a summit between Trump and Kim rise, it’s far from clear that Washington has it’s expectations calibrated properly or that this administration is sweating the technical details that matter. If Trump shows up to a meeting with Kim expecting the North Korean leader to turn over the keys to his nuclear program, he’ll leave sorely disappointed—maybe even furious and inclined toward war.But there’s no reason for that. A look at history and at the state of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs today make clear what Kim is and isn’t willing to do. Trump and his advisers should take heed before the summit."},
 {'title': 'People Are Getting Fentanyl in the Mail, and the Bill That Would Let the Post Office Stop Has Gone Nowhere',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis has endorsed it, President Trump touted its goals during the 2016 campaign, and the two most recent Department of Homeland Security secretaries said they supported it. But a bipartisan bill that would help curb the delivery of the deadly opioid fentanyl by the United States Postal Service to American doorsteps has not seen the light of day, leaving advocates scratching their heads.In January, Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Tom Carper (D-DE) released a report from the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations detailing how the Chinese use the mail to send fentanyl into the United States undetected (PDF). That’s because USPS does not have to follow the same rules as private carriers like UPS and FedEx to have packages screened through advanced electronic data (AED) before entering the United States. “The websites that were willing to sell fentanyl online, and by the way, it’s scary what’s going on, all said the same thing,” Portman said in a recent interview with Hugh Hewitt. “Send it by the post office. Send it through the U.S. postal service, we’ll guarantee delivery. If you send it through a private carrier, we cannot guarantee delivery.” Their study looked at six online distributors, five in China and one that was unidentifiable, which shipped hundreds of packages into the United States. To stop them, Portman has introduced the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act or STOP Act that would bring USPS in line with\xa0its private counterparts. There is hope among advocates that President Trump’s speech on Monday as well as the inclusion of the issue in the White House’s opioid abuse initiative—such as it is—will bring new interest to the issue and renewed urgency for Congress to act on a drug so potent that first responders attempting to help users have become poisoned by mere contact with the substance. “As Homeland Security Secretary I worried, and the country worried about weapons of mass destruction, we are talking about it. It comes in small kernels of synthetic drugs,” said former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, who is a senior adviser for the advocacy group Americans for Securing All Packages (ASAP), which is backed by a number of business groups that rely on the postal service, including several that represent the pharmaceutical industry.“I’ve had some recent experience with first responders and they show up and do whatever they can to save lives and in the process, in this regard they are jeopardizing their own.” While Trump’s speech in New Hampshire did not mention the issue specifically (despite reports that he would) and instead\xa0went down a policy rabbit hole that included killing drug dealers, accusations that Democrats don’t care about the children of undocumented immigrants, the perils of so-called sanctuary cities and the importance a wall (to somehow stop the influx of drugs from China), Ridge was still hopeful that the president’s previous comments and a slew from federal agencies will spur action. “There are multiple agencies in the federal government that have already recognized the need to close it, people from DHS have said close it, the Drug Enforcement Agency said that it’s a problem, the Food and Drug Administration said it’s a problem, Customs and Border Protection said it’s a problem, the president’s commission on addiction said it’s a problem, it’s a loophole, let’s close it,” Ridge said. “The president said in his 2016 campaign in New Hampshire said ‘it’s a problem, close it,’ so I think the agencies that have to deal with the fallout of these illegal drugs they understand and now it’s a matter of getting the Congress to send the bill to the president.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.A Senate aide said plans for bipartisan hearings about the opioids are in the works, but the details were not yet finalized. A White House official echoed this sentiment, saying earlier this week that they had to clear the deck of more pressing issues, like funding the government, before focusing on a coordinated push. A spokesman for Rep. John Faso (R-NY), the lead co-sponsor of a companion bill in the House, said his boss is working closely with Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) to make sure it moves forward. A spokesman for USPS defended their efforts, pointing to a statement Robert Cintron, vice president of Network Operations United States Postal Service, made before a Senate committee in January noting that between fiscal years 2016 and 2017\xa0“the Postal Inspection Service achieved a 375 percent increase in international parcel seizures, and an 880 percent increase in domestic parcel seizures related to opioids.”The statement noted that while the USPS supports the STOP Act, it wants changes to accommodate “direct relationships with their international customers and… require them to provide [Advance Electronic Data] before accepting their packages” instead of requiring the postal service to do the electronic screening itself.“In the last 3 years, we have gone from receiving almost no [Advance Electronic Data] on inbound shipments to achieving current levels at approximately 40 percent,” the statement notes. “We have suggested thoughtful modifications to the bill to make it workable and effective and which we can fully support.” Juliette Kayyem, President Obama’s former assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at the Department of Homeland Security and ASAP senior adviser, said it was an “interesting argument.”“What advanced screening data can actually do is provide an opportunity for our packages to be the equivalent of TSA pre-cleared,” she said. “The system we have now (for the USPS) is not a 21st century system, it’s not advanced data screening, we don’t know what’s coming in—very unlike airplanes and cargo.”Still, she and Ridge hoped that with the president’s attention this would soon be one front of the battle against opioids that could easily be won. “You say to yourself, well will closing the loophole end it all, it will not, but it’s one of several steps that needs to be taken,” Ridge said. “He committed people [to the opioid issue] he committed money and this one doesn’t require either, it just requires his signature.”"},

 {'title': 'Dickey Amendment: Did Congress Just Unleash the CDC on Guns?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Language tucked into a government spending bill in Congress may end the de facto 22-year-old ban on gun research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bill released by lawmakers on Wednesday included funding for school safety and strengthening background checks for guns. But maybe most significantly, it also clarifies the \xa0“Dickey Amendment” by saying the CDC is allowed to study the causes and effects of gun violence. Named after its author, former Rep. Jay Dickey, the amendment barred the CDC \xa0from doing research to “advocate or promote gun control.” Passed in 1996, it also stripped the CDC of the $2.6 million in funding it had set aside that year for gun-violence research. After the funding cut and warning, the CDC interpreted the amendment as a practical ban on studying gun violence.The Dickey Amendment “represented a shot across the bow. If you want to do research in this area, it can make your life miserable,” said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, a CDC veteran who founded the agency’s Center for Injury Prevention and Control during the Clinton administration. “The Dickey Amendment essentially prevented research from the top-down on one of the most important public health issues,” said Stanford University’s Sarabeth Spitzer, co-author of a study last year that found gun injuries cost over $6 billion in hospital and doctor visits from 2006 to 2014.“The Dickey Amendment essentially prevented research from the top-down on one of the most important public health issues.”— Stanford University’s Sarabeth Spitzer“If you look at research on some of the top killers of the United States population, firearms have lagged behind," said Spitzer. The NRA lobbied heavily for the amendment, and its author, Rep. Jay Dickey even called himself the organization’s “point man.” The NRA told members that research on the gun epidemic would lead to “you losing all your guns,” according to Rosenberg. In 2015, after the San Bernardino massacre that killed 14 people, Dickey said he regretted that his namesake law slowed research of the gun violence epidemic. “Doing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution,” he wrote in a letter to Congress. Rosenberg, who once viewed Dickey as his “archenemy” said the two became friends (Dickey died in April 2017). Rosenberg added that he believes Congress should provide funding to the CDC for gun violence research and that by altering the amendment, but not repealing it, lawmakers gives more ease to gun-rights advocates. “It gives cover to Republicans who want to research to go on,” added Rosenberg. The omnibus’s language “is saying Congress realizes the important contribution science has in solving this problem,” said Dr. Rosenberg. But the omnibus spending bill did not explicitly give the CDC more money to study guns, and some gun policy and public health experts say funding is the key to unlocking the hold on government-backed gun research. “The change that I’ve seen in the bill’s language is not a very big change. It doesn’t say that Congress supports more gun violence research. What’s really needed is some funding.” said Andrew Morral, a senior behavioral scientist and lead researcher behind RAND’s Gun Policy initiative.

The former president also asked for $10 million of the yearly budget to go to the CDC for research, but Congress blocked the funding, effectively keeping the ban intact, according to the Washington Post. \xa0In 2015, there were less than 20 researchers dedicated to studying gun-violence in the United States, The Daily Beast previously reported. Before the gun violence epidemic can be solved, it has to be studied, according to Rosenberg.“It’s the science that’s going to get us out of this deadly mess,” he said.'},

  'body': 'Ten people are dead and 10 others injured after a gunman opened fire inside a high school near Houston, Texas, on Friday.That is the highest number of fatalities at a school shooting since the February 14 massacre at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, has been identified as the shooter by law enforcement, and was booked in the Galveston County Jail for capital murder. In a Friday afternoon press conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said there are two others that are currently in custody and are “of interest” to the shooting.Witnesses said that the shooting began around 7:30 a.m when the gunman burst through the door of an art class and yelled “surprise!” before opening fire. The suspect left explosive devices inside and outside the school, Sheriff Trochesset said. According to court documents, he spared the lives of certain students whom he liked, so he could "have his story told."The shooter was reportedly armed with an assault-style rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol—with the shooter using a “shotgun and .38 revolver”\xa0that were obtained from his father, Gov. Abbot said. The explosive devices also reportedly “included pressure cookers and pipe bombs,” and Gov. Abbot said that a “CO2 device” and “molotov cocktail”\xa0have been recovered while police are searching two residences and a vehicle.Gov. Abbot also said that the shooter “had intention to commit suicide, but gave himself up.” Houston police officer John Barnes and another officer confronted Pagourtzis, but not before Barnes was injured by a shotgun blast. Surgeons restarted Barnes’ heart twice, his friend told the Houston Chronicle, and repaired wounds in both arms. Barnes is a 25-year veteran of the Houston Police Department who was stationed at the school four months ago.On Friday afternoon, the name of at least one victim was revealed. Friends confirmed the death of 64-year-old substitute teacher, Ann Perkins.Perkins was a fixture at Santa Fe High School. On Twitter, students mourned and posted tributes to the educator they affectionately called “Grandma Perkins.”“She subs in the high school every day. Kids know her,” said Chelsea Pourchot, a junior. “We all just called her Grandma Perkins. She was just always there for all the kids. Kind of like a mentor, kind of a grandma.”“She was there for everybody,” Pourchot added. “She would sit there and talk to you about your problems. She was an all-around sweet lady.”Tim Coronado, the owner of a local dance studio, confirmed Perkins’ death. In a Facebook post, Coronado asked for prayers for Perkins’ daughter, Ashley, and Perkins’ husband. “Prayers for her, for comfort and peace and her dad who has no idea because he is flying in air,” he wrote.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The cops finally came and got us out and told us to run as fast as we can. \xa0I have never been more afraid in my life.”“My class is right next to the police office,” Thurman explained. “So we heard the door start shaking to the police officers’ room. Mr. [Steve] Rose, my teacher, opened the door and was like, ‘What’s wrong?’”“Someone has a shotgun, everybody hide!” the student said a school police officer replied.Rey Montemayor III, a senior, was in history class when the fire alarm went off. As he waited in a field in the back of the school, he assumed it was only a drill. Minutes later, he heard six gunshots.“When we stepped outside, we heard fire trucks. We all started getting close to the school,” Montemayor told The Daily Beast. “Out of nowhere, the teacher yelled, ‘Get back’ and ‘Run away!’ That’s when we heard the gunshots.”“At first I didn’t run because I thought it was fake. I didn’t know what was going on,” he added. “You saw the window shatter and it just got real.”Thurman said she and her classmates hid in their room for a while, too, until the fire alarm rang. “Next thing you know, this cop is like, ‘I’m going to need you all to run as fast as you can,’” Thurman recalled.They ran toward one door, then were ordered to turn around to the main doors in a single file line. “Keep running. Go to Highway 6 and don’t stop,” Thurman recalled someone instructing.Students ran across Highway 6 into the yard of Ruth Casner.Casner, a pre-kindergarten teacher, said she was getting ready for work when students started moving towards her. “They were screaming and yelling,” she said. “Next thing you know there were ambulances everywhere.” Montemayor said his friend, Clay Horn, was shot twice in the chest and is in critical condition. Another pal, Chris Stone, is among the missing.And Thurman said her step-niece hasn’t been accounted for. Shana Fisher, 16, was in art class when the gunfire rang out. Her family is waiting at the Alamo Gym, where parents are reuniting with their children.“She has art for first period. We just don’t know where she is and if she’s okay. We’re praying,” Thurman added. “It’s really shocking to hear this could happen in our schools.”Fellow student Paige Curry was asked by KTRK-TV if she’d ever thought this couldn’t possibly happen at her school. “No. It’s been happening everywhere,” she replied. “I’ve always felt it would eventually happen here, too.”Suzannah Salazar told a KHOU reporter that her sister, 10th grader Sarah Salazar, has “been shot” and taken to the hospital after not hearing from her during the school evacuations. Sarah was allegedly in the “art class where shooting is said to have occurred.”Santa Fe High School is the sole high school in the Santa Fe Independent School District, located in Galveston County, just 35 miles southeast of central Houston. Per the district, the school serves a total of 1,447 students.Santa Fe is the 22nd school shooting in 2018, according to CNN.“Santa Fe is such a small town and full of so many happy people. Everybody knows each other,” Thurman told The Daily Beast. “These deaths are going to be a horrible thing to mourn and grieve.

Now he faces mounting calls for his resignation amid a sex scandal that grew only more serious Wednesday night, when a state House committee released a graphic, 25-page report with testimony from a woman who claims he coerced her into a sexual encounter, then blackmailed her with a partially nude photo. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley was quick to call for Greitens' immediate resignation, saying the report contains “contains shocking, substantial, and corroborated evidence of wrongdoing by Governor Greitens.” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the Democratic incumbent whom Hawley will challenge in November, made a similar declaration. “I have read the official report from the Republican led Missouri House investigation, including the sworn testimony,” McCaskill said in a statement. “It is clearly time to put the interests of the people of Missouri first. The Governor should resign.”The Missouri House committee that investigated the allegations against Greitens is now considering whether lawmakers should move to impeachment the Republican governor from office.Greitens, a father of two and former Navy SEAL who entered office in January 2017,\xa0has maintained that his affair with a hairdresser was an “entirely consensual relationship.”But in the report released Wednesday night, the woman told a much different—and far darker—story, detailing how he allegedly “coerced” her into giving him oral sex in his basement while she was “uncontrollably crying.”The woman, who is referred to in the report as “Witness 1,” said that in March 2015, Greitens, whom she’d had a crush on, insisted that she come over to his St. Louis home one morning. There, he convinced her to change into loungewear so they could do what she initially thought would be a “sexy workout.”He then blindfolded her and taped her hands to a pair of workout rings, she said. At one point, he “starts kissing kind of like down to my chest. And he takes the shirt and rips it open,” she said. Greitens proceeded to pull off her pants without her consent, then took what sounded like a photo, she said.“Don’t even mention my name to anybody at all, because if you do, I’m going to take these pictures, and I’m going to put them everywhere I can,” he threatened her, according to the report. The woman said she felt “embarrassed and shamed”—and tried to leave, but he grabbed her in a “bear hug.” She “didn’t feel necessarily able to leave without performing oral sex,” the report says. The pair had multiple other sexual encounters, she said. During one, he “smacked” and “grabbed” her, shoving her to the ground, the woman said.“And I instantly just started bawling and was just like, ‘What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?’” she told the committee.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'body': "A California couple who once filed a lawsuit accusing President Trump of being the Illuminati’s stealth candidate and a leader of the New World Order has now filed court papers in the legal saga surrounding Michael Cohen.Since April, Janis and Gregory Kaighn have filed two letters to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, who is presiding over Cohen’s case. (Cohen, Trump’s embattled personal attorney, has waged a court battle to limit prosecutors’ review of his attorney-client records after the FBI raided his home, office, and hotel.)On Monday, the Kaighns’ bizarre letters became part of the Southern District of New York’s official public record. The couple first wrote to Wood on April 23 “for the purpose of asserting our rights as crime victims,” the letter states.The Kaighns claim their son was kidnapped “by persons acting on behalf of” Trump and Cohen in 2016 and that they have an audiotape to prove it. “We have every reason to believe that information related to both of us and our son is included in the materials seized from Michael Cohen,” the Kaighns wrote.While the couple claims their child was snatched away by Trump conspirators, a review of social media posts suggests he is free and well.The missives come as Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels’ fast-talking lawyer, seeks to intervene in the Cohen legal drama. Attorney Peter Gleason is also requesting a protective order for his own Cohen communications. In court filings, Gleason said he represented two women who accused former New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman of sexual abuse. According to Gleason’s letter to Wood, he shared dirt on the now-disgraced Schneiderman with Cohen in 2013, as Trump mulled a run for governor of New York.Gleason’s clients did not participate in the New Yorker exposé about Schneiderman’s alleged misconduct, journalist Jane Mayer said.On May 17, the Kaighns wrote Wood again. They said, “for reasons unexplained, our letter has not been filed in the public records of this case,” while Gleason’s made it to the court file.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In 2002, when James Comey was merely the fresh-faced U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and not the focal point of unprecedented presidential fury, the future FBI director got his first exposure to the world of organized crime.Weeks after the death of John Gotti, Comey led the dogged prosecution of 14 alleged members of the Gambino crime family on charges of extortion, robbery, and murder—and cautioned the public that the era of criminal syndicates and shadowy dons was far from over.“Folks who think that organized crime is a thing of the past in New York are kidding themselves,” Comey said at the time. “These people are out there, and they are struggling to revive and to maintain these organized crime families.”More than 15 years later, Comey spent the majority of a five-hour interview making the same point to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. This time, however, the alleged crime boss in his crosshairs wasn’t a capo in the Cosa Nostra but the president of the United States.“I don’t do it lightly,” Comey grimly told Stephanopoulos of the comparison, but “that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration.”The week leading up to Comey’s sitdown with one of network television’s most aggressive interlocutors—an interview pegged to the upcoming publication of his memoir, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership—was peppered with tantalizing leaks from the tell-all relating to President Donald Trump’s hand size, height, and theoretical appearance in a Russian water sport video.“I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013,” Comey said. “It’s possible, but I don’t know.”Speaking with Stephanopoulos, Comey grabbed at a few of those low-hanging fruit: Trump’s mane was “impressively coiffed,” his tie “too long,” his face “slightly orange up close, with small white half-moons under his eyes.”But despite Comey’s somewhat shady asides and evident fascination with the so-called pee tape (the former FBI director mentioned the subject, in unrestrained detail, 11 times over the course of the interview), his primary focus was linking Trump with the Mafia term amica nostra, “a friend of ours”—and what he sees as the president’s obsession with personal fealty.“There’s an expression in the Mafia: There’s a distinction between a friend of yours and a friend of ours. A friend of yours is someone on the outside of the family, a friend of ours, an ‘amica nostra,’ is the way they talked about it in Sicilian, is part of the Family, capital F.“It’s the family,” Comey said. “The family, the family, the family.”In his book, the former prosecutor linked Trump’s impulses to those of Five Families enforcers even more explicitly: “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.”“A man ‘who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.’”— James ComeyGet The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The Trump administration has sneeringly derided Comey’s book and the attendant media blitz as “nothing more than a poorly executed PR stunt,” as White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Friday, perpetrated by a man desperate to rehabilitate his “tattered reputation and enrich his own bank account.”That condemnation paled in comparison to that of Trump himself, who in a flurry of Sunday morning tweets denied that he ever asked the FBI director for an oath of loyalty and suggested that Comey should be imprisoned.“The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more?” Trump tweeted. “Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!”Those tweets, Comey told Stephanopoulos, are just the most public glimpse of Trump’s authoritarian impulses.Although the scope of the interview rarely widened beyond the current occupant of the White House, Stephanopoulos did broach the great irony of Comey’s time as the nation’s top law enforcement official: how his actions during the 2016 presidential campaign may have helped bring about the election of the man he now sees as a “morally unfit” to serve as president.“It sucked,” Comey said of his feelings about reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server in the final days of the campaign. “I felt like I was totally alone, that everybody hated me. And that there wasn’t a way out because it really was the right thing to do.”That excuse, former Clinton backers told The Daily Beast, is too little, too late.“Why the fuck does he think it’s OK to just reopen an investigation 10 days before an election?” Philippe Reines, former adviser to Clinton, told The Daily Beast ahead of the interview’s broadcasting. “He feels a need to tell the country that Hillary Clinton is the most guilty innocent person that he’s ever looked into but neglects to mention to the same country that Donald Trump appears to be the most guilty guilty person he’s in the middle of looking at. Why?”For his part, Comey acknowledged that in the moments after Trump’s election, he questioned his own role in the most stunning political upset in modern American history: “A whole lot of me was thinking, ‘Oh my god, did we have some role in this?’” Comey said. “I don’t know about the answer.”Comey also touched on Trump’s increasingly public personal problems, as well as the numerous accusations of sexual impropriety lodged against the president, calling Trump a man “who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat.”That kind of man, Comey said, “who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.”Trump’s persistent avoidance of the truth, from the size of the crowd at his inauguration to the motivations behind Comey’s own firing, the former FBI director said, make Trump “morally unfit to be president.”And of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, and of potential Kremlin kompromat on the president?“I think it’s possible—I don’t know,” Comey said. “These are more words I never thought I’d utter about a president of the United States, but it’s possible.”Despite his own feelings about the president—and his acknowledgement that the source of the Steele dossier detailing alleged connections between Trump associates and the Kremlin was “credible”—Comey told Stephanopoulos that he does not believe Trump should be impeached.“I hope not, because I think impeaching and removing Donald Trump from office would let the American people off the hook,” Comey said. “People in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values.”The former FBI director, whose interview has already infuriated the most powerful man in the world, appeared to be at peace with his firing—and with having made a formidable enemy.“The deputy director... looked at me and said, ‘You know you’re totally screwed, right?’” Comey recalled in the waning days of the campaign. “And I smiled, and I said, ‘Yup. Nobody gets out alive.’ And this may sound strange? That’s kind of freeing.”"},
 {'title': 'The Fight for Our Future Belongs to the ’Burbs',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Look away from President Trump and it’s easier to see how three long-term demographic and geographic trends are reshaping American politics.The demography favors Democrats. A growing share of the population is made of the unmarried, minorities, children of immigrants, and millennials. These are the rising groups—what some Democrats like to call the “the coalition of the ascendant”—that were sure to propel Hillary Clinton into the White House. Until they didn’t.The geography, on the other hand, favors Republicans. Although the election was won tactically in the Midwest, Trump’s largest margin of victory came from red states, many with swelling populations, such as Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Arizona, and the Carolinas. A third shift—the toughest to predict the political impact of—could be the most consequential: the movement within metropolitan areas. The core base of the Democratic Party is built around the urban core, particularly in large cities; that of the GOP is located in more rural areas. Yet the most recent census data suggests growth in both of these areas have mostly stopped, while the big gains now are in suburbs and smaller cities, including some in the now Republican-leaning Midwest. Over the past two decades, the non-Hispanic white population has declined from 76 percent of the population to 63. By 2030, according to Census Bureau projections, that percentage could fall to 56.This is not good news for today’s Republican Party, which counts heavily on the votes of non-Hispanic whites. These voters, motivated in part by their diminishing share of the population and political pies, supported Trump over Clinton by 21 percentage points. Trump did somewhat better with black and Hispanic voters than his more genteel predecessor Mitt Romney. Still, Trump lost Hispanic, African-American, and Asian voters by wide margins—winning less than 1 in 3 Hispanic voters and less than 1 in 10 black voters. In elections so far, millennials—who will be the country’s biggest voting bloc by 2024—also have tilted decisively to the Democrats. Still, support for Trump and the GOP has been edging up, particularly among white millennials, since the 2016 election. Many millennials, faced with dismal prospects for higher wages and steady work and, in some areas, insurmountable barriers to home ownership, are embracing socialistic policies.\xa0High rents have added to the appeal of the redistributionist agenda of what the 538 website has called a Democratic version of the “tea party”—free college, rent control and subsidies, and guaranteed jobs. This approach, as opposed to Clintonian moderation,\xa0increasingly dominates Democratic politics, a trend reaffirmed in the recent primary elections across the country. Ironically, the very forces, such as high housing prices, rents, and limited job opportunities are driving millennials, and minorities, to the very places that have served as bulwarks of conservatism, including Trump-friendly metros such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Nashville, and Indianapolis.\xa0The trajectory of migration works largely against the Democrats. In a recent analysis for Chief Executive magazine we found that while blue regions like San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Denver, and Portland enjoyed the largest increase of people 20-29. But when people start entering their thirties—the fastest growing demographic cohort—Austin, San Antonio, Tampa, Orlando, and Raleigh take the lead. For people in their forties, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Florida cities are preferred. Among boomers—second only to millennials in numbers—New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Jose, Boston, and San Francisco lose out to lower-cost Sunbelt metros including Phoenix, Austin, Las Vegas, Orlando, and Tampa.The winners in the migration sweepstakes, notably among those approaching their child-bearing and house-buying years—are states that traditionally lean red: Texas, Arizona, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, and Utah. Due also to higher birth rates, these states and their metro regions are growing far faster than their blue rivals, where Trump was generally trounced. New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut have long experienced sub-par growth; New York is barely growing at all. Most importantly, California, which once led the nation in population growth, is decidedly slowing down with growth last year below the national average as a result of strong domestic out-migration, faltering immigration, and a lower-than-average birth rate. These numbers will alter the nation’s political balance. In the coming decade, congressional seats, and Electoral College votes, will continue to move to red states. Since 2000, the number of congressional seats has grown by two in both Texas and Florida while declining by two in New York and Ohio. The 2010 census added no congressional seats for California—for the first time since 1920.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.It remains to be seen if demographic states turn red states purple or blue, or if the blue new arrivals end up turning purple or red. But the latter seems more likely. Texas, for example, has been said to be “turning blue” for almost a decade, but continues—even as it gets more and more young people, minorities, and immigrants—to vote heavily Republican. Reporters who spend their time inside the 610 loop in Houston, and the cities of Dallas and Austin, may see the blue tide as inevitable, but it’s a different picture when you travel to the smaller cities, suburbs, and exurbs of this fast-growing state.Even if the tide is turning, it’s happening slowly, and the GOP has political and cultural advantages in both Texas and Florida that will delay any turning of the tide even if they don’t finally stop it. Latinos in Texas, for instance, are considerably more GOP-leaning than their counterparts elsewhere. And surely some of the blue-state refugees won’t be inclined to support the same policies that led them to leave these states in the first place. The suburban areas that attract newcomers still tilt decisively GOP, and in 2016, turned out mostly for Trump. As America bifurcates by generation, race, and geography, dispersion has continued apace. Despite efforts by politicians, pundits, and planners—mostly Democrats—to foster dense urbanization, Americans have continued to seek space, affordable housing, and safety. As the most recent census data shows, the much ballyhooed “return to the city,” always exaggerated in the press, has all but ceased while suburban growth is accelerating.Indeed, in virtually every metro area, population growth continues to be mostly in the suburbs and exurbs. Even in metropolitan areas of over a million, upwards of 85 percent of people live in a world of backyards, cars, malls, and generally good schools, compared to under 15 percent around the urban core. And the suburban share continues to increase, as evidenced in last year’s census estimates.The economy has followed the population, with suburbs accounting for 80 percent of all new jobs created since 2010. Some suburban areas, like Plano, north of Dallas, may soon have more office jobs\xa0than the historic downtown. The fastest growing big regions for jobs—such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and Nashville—are clustered in deep-red states, Forbes has found. Six of the 10 fastest growing regions have virtually no traditional urban core; all six are in the south or Intermountain West.Overall, suburbs tend to slightly favor Republicans. Trump out-polled Hillary Clinton in suburbs by four points, two points better than Romney.That might change as millennials, immigrants, and minorities move to the periphery. The latest Current Population Survey on domestic migration indicates strong movement of Hispanics, African Americans, and Asians to the suburbs of metropolitan areas, and away from urban cores (.xls file). For example, a net 303,000 African Americans moved to the suburbs as 333,000 moved away from the principal cities. Suburbs are also home to many educated older voters, who, according to some surveys, are turned off by the Trump presidency. The combination of greater racial diversity, older educated voters, and millennials could topple the GOP stranglehold this year. This has been happening already in key areas such as Fort Bend County, Texas, outside Houston (PDF), which by some measurements constitutes the country’s most diverse county, and increasingly Latino and Asian Orange County, California. Stronger enforcement of immigration laws does not work well in districts where a large chunk of the population is made up of immigrants and their children. Similarly, young suburbanites with children in school may be more susceptible to Democratic positions on issues like gun control and education.Yet the Democratic drive to win these areas also faces challenges. As people buy houses and start families, they tend to become more\xa0conservative and Republican leaning. Millennials, now mostly renters according to American Community Survey data, are seen as reliably Democratic by most pundits but recent polls show that as they age into marriage, family formation, and homeownership, they seem considerably less disposed to support Democrats. Suburban residents are more likely than urban core residents or aging rural residents to have children, nearly twice as likely to be homeowners and be part of the country’s large, albeit beleaguered, middle class. They may be swayed by a strong economy, which many millennials credit to the GOP. Contempt for suburbia, so common among Democratic-leaning academics, planners, and media, could make appealing to these voters more difficult. Many party leaders\xa0support forced densification, anti-car strategies, and the annexation of suburbs—ideas that lack broad appeal in a country where most people live in single family homes and rely on cars and roads to conduct their lives. It may not help that some leftists in California and Seattle are now attacking single-family houses as inherently racist and environmentally toxic. Ultimately the future of American politics will revolve around appealing to these increasingly diverse suburban and red-state voters. However unpalatable Trump may be to some, the Democratic Party’s lurch toward an intersectional agenda of open borders and more immigration, climate alarmism, cultural progressivism, and relentless centralization of power at the federal level may have limited appeal, particularly amidst a stronger economy. Since last fall, Democrats have seen their advantage on the generic ballot slip from 12 percent to 4 percent.Parties win elections by paying attention to voters, their aspirations and how they like to live. Neither ultra-conservative rural areas or deep-blue urban cores represent the future of American politics—a future that will be decided in the largely suburban areas of our fastest-growing metropolitan areas."},

  'body': 'During a conference call Wednesday that signaled a White House willingness to fight for its controversial CIA director nominee, The Daily Beast asked what Gina Haspel did at the CIA’s Counterterrorist Center during the critical years of 2003 and 2004. It’s between those dates where the most is at stake for Haspel’s chances to become director. It’s when, substantively, the least about her resume is substantively known. It’s also between those dates that the Counterterrorist Center was at peak operations of its torture program. Marc Short, White House Director of Legislative Affairs, pledged to take the question. Later on Wednesday, Short provided the following reply:“After 9/11, like many of her colleagues, Gina Haspel stepped forward to contribute to the counterterrorism mission. \xa0For the next three years, she worked on counterterrorism operations at CIA HQs and for brief periods in the field.  Regardless of location, she adhered to the law at all times. Due to the nature of her work, much of her career at CIA was classified. \xa0That being said, the CIA intends on sharing her classified record with all Senators so they can properly fulfill their role in the confirmation process.”It’s worth noting that the human-rights groups and anti-torture senators who have expressed opposition to Haspel have called for disclosure of Haspel’s relationship with the torture program – not only to the Senate, but to the public. Even formally unopposed Senator Dianne Feinstein, to whom many Democratic senators are likely to view as a bellwether on Haspel since Feinstein led the 2014 torture investigation, has called for public disclosure.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'In the weeks before the Republican National Convention in 2016, then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told Cambridge Analytica he wasn’t interested in its services—and, in the process, angered a very powerful Republican mega-donor. Manafort had joined the Trump’s campaign to help the then-nominee gear up for the convention, and he became the campaign’s chairman (deposing Corey Lewandowski) on May 29. After taking the helm, Alexander Nix—Cambridge’s now-suspended CEO—met with Manafort in person to pitch him on his firm’s data services, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.The company has long been enmeshed with powerful Republican circles. According to an email sent by a Cambridge Analytica staffer and reviewed by The Daily Beast, the company licensed data from DataTrust, which manages Republican National Committee’s voter data. Ad Age described DataTrust in 2016 as “the RNC’s exclusive data provider.” By the time of the Manafort-Nix get-together, Cambridge had worked for Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign and for the pro-Trump super PAC funded by the GOP king-makers Robert and Rebekah Mercer. But Cambridge Analytica hadn’t yet worked for Trump’s campaign. Nix wanted in. After hearing the pitch and the price for Cambridge’s services, Manafort communicated to Nix that he wasn’t interested, according to the two sources. Manafort also communicated to associates that he had a low opinion of the firm’s offerings. He wasn’t alone in this view; numerous campaign operatives who have worked with Cambridge have told The Daily Beast over the years that they found its offerings sub-par, overstated, and disappointing. As one longtime Republican data operative put it: “People think they’re dealing with evil masterminds, when they’re really just Keystone Cops.”Rebekah Mercer wasn’t happy about Manafort’s rejection of the company, according to the sources. She was (and still is) a member of the company’s board, and her father—billionaire hedge fund savant Robert Mercer—has investments in the company. Despite Manafort’s initial rejection, the company kept trying to get on board with the campaign. And Mercer finally got her way: On July 29, 2016, the campaign paid $100,000 to the company—its first payment to Cambridge—for “data management services,” according to a filing with the Federal Elections Commission. Over the following months, the campaign paid the company $5.9 million for its services. The company simultaneously worked for the super PAC, a lawful practice that campaign finance watchdogs believe can present major ethical problems. In total, the super PAC paid Cambridge Analytica about $1.5 million during the presidential campaign season (including payments made when the super PAC was supporting Cruz). A spokesperson for Manafort declined to comment. A lawyer for Rebekah Mercer did not respond to requests for comment, and neither did a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica. Manafort left Trump’s campaign on Aug. 19, 2016. Just over a year later, special counsel Bob Mueller charged him with a number of crimes related to his work lobbying for foreign governments.Cambridge Analytica is now at the center of a political and media vortex, since the U.K.’s Observer and The New York Times published damning exposés centered around a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower. Channel 4 released documentaries based on hidden-camera footage, showing Nix saying the company uses blackmail and bribery to help its preferred candidates win. Last year, Nix told Rebekah Mercer that he offered the company’s services to WikiLeaks to help disburse emails stolen from Hillary Clinton. Assange confirmed to The Daily Beast that Nix reached out and that he declined his help. And an email sent by a Cambridge Analytica staffer and reviewed by The Daily Beast shows the company relished the prospect of more Clinton email leaks. '},
 {'title': 'Can American and Chinese Workers Unite With a Trade War Looming?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On March 22, citing rampant intellectual property theft, President Trump announced $50 billion in penalties on Chinese goods. Then, on April 5, he rolled out another $100 billion in tariffs when China retaliated. This all followed on the heels of his March 1 declaration of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, which would have a small but not altogether insignificant effect on China. Trump’s moves baffled and enraged mainstream economists. But they also exposed the deep ideological rifts that exist on trade and China in the United States. In particular, they represent a dilemma for the labor movement and the left—and a chance to chart a new path forward, one focused less on inter-state competition and more on shared struggle.There are at least two narratives about trade and China on the American right. The first, nationalist narrative, has the President as its standard bearer today and individuals like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro as its boosters. According to this crowd, schemers in Beijing are taking advantage of weak-willed or incompetent politicians in United States. As Trump puts it, China has been “taking advantage of us like nobody in history.” If we were not such idiots, the logic goes, we would be enjoying a trade surplus with the world’s number two economy. An assertive gesture—or three—will make China back off and restore balance. A second, competing narrative comes from the traditional business wing of the Republican Party. According to it, China is less a threat to be combated than a capitalist ideal to be emulated. This narrative is exemplified by Mitt Romney’s 1998 comments as head of Bain Capital, describing a trip he made to a factory in China, where “5,000 Chinese, all graduated from high school, 18 to 24 years old, were working, working, working, as hard as they could, at rates of roughly 50 cents an hour.” These employees, Romney fondly recalled, “cared about their jobs; they wouldn’t even look up as we walked by.” The implication: American workers, in contrast, are under-motivated and overpaid and they—and more so, their unions—should be taken down a notch for the good of the country and themselves. “Trump’s steel tariffs were welcomed by the leadership of the AFL-CIO, as well as labor-aligned politicians like Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, and the president received grudging support from groups like Public Citizen and websites like The Huffington Post.”The labor movement and left are also divided over how to approach China and trade. Given the devastation that has been visited on the American industrial working class since the 1970s, one natural impulse is to try to turn back the clock to the situation before China was welcomed into the World Trade Organization or at least change the tenor of the relationship from the business-friendly approach pioneered by Bill Clinton and carried on since. In this vein, Trump’s steel tariffs were welcomed by the leadership of the AFL-CIO, as well as labor-aligned politicians like Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, and the president received grudging support from groups like Public Citizen and websites like The Huffington Post.This impulse has its limitations. For many goods, the People’s Republic is only the last stop in corporate supply chains that stretch around the world, with, to take the example of an iPhone , design happening in California, cobalt coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Chinese simply doing the final assembly before items are shipped to your neighborhood AT&T store (one analysis shows that if we adopt a value-added perspective, the U.S.-China trade deficit is a third lower than it appears in conventional accounting). The problem is less trade with any particular country than footloose capital. Moreover, emphasizing trade deficits often carries with it a certain jingoism and sits awkwardly with international labor solidarity. A competing approach to China is exemplified by the anti-sweatshop movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which was driven by concern over the exploitation endured by precisely people like the “hard working” employees that Romney admired. Activists involved in this movement made clear that they were not demanding that the plants they investigated in the People’s Republic and elsewhere shut down and put their employees out of work—in fact, they criticized employers who “cut and ran” when faced with scandal. Instead, organizers called for improvements in working conditions, to be monitored by third parties or, better yet, empowered employees themselves (I was involved in related organizations). But achieving sustained progress on anything but the most egregious abuses, like child labor, proved difficult. Negotiated codes of conduct were hard to enforce. Media attention was fleeting. Another tack is one that was taken in the first decade of the twenty-first century by some unionists, especially those affiliated with the Change to Win federation, who reached out to the Chinese Communist Party-controlled All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), hoping that an alliance with this body could open a new front against companies like Wal-Mart. Early exchanges between representatives seemed promising. In some instances, they had the benefit of bolstering reformists in various branches of the ACFTU. But the organization as a whole generally treated its interactions with labor movements in other countries, the U.S. most certainly included, as opportunities to engage in diplomacy on behalf of China and the Communist Party, not to coordinate campaigns. And at the enterprise level, the ACFTU remained deeply entangled with management. “But if a full-scale trade war and increased tension between the U.S. and P.R.C. are in store, then building on sparks of solidarity between the two countries’ workers will be all the more important.”However, there is yet another, more promising approach. Over the past decade and a half, ties have grown between Chinese and American labor activists. Especially since the mid-2000s, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in China engaged on workers’ rights issues have expanded rapidly in number. These groups more or less take the form of the “workers’ centers” in the United States that have championed the rights of immigrant restaurant employees and other populations who have too often proved out of reach of traditional unions. In China, given the lack of representative unions, such organizations play a more wide-ranging role, acting alternately like law firms, cultural centers, and unions themselves. Directly and via Hong Kong intermediaries, Americans have connected with these groups (the anti-sweatshop movement was an early catalyst for dialogue). There have also been limited instances of direct engagement between workers in China and the U.S. themselves. Maintaining such bonds will be extremely difficult going forward. Under the hardline leadership of current Communist Party General Secretary and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Chinese labor activists have increasingly been placed on the defensive. In 2015, dozens were swept up in a crackdown in the broader Guangzhou area and two NGO leaders, including the head of one of the country’s oldest worker organizations, were eventually put on trial. Various lurid accusations were made against these individuals, but their true crime in the eyes of authorities was clearly that they had begun openly helping workers engage in collective bargaining following wildcat strikes. The Chinese government has simultaneously become increasingly anxious about what it perceives as foreign meddling, passing a tough Foreign NGO Management Law in 2016. Supporting Chinese workers will not bring jobs back to the United States. After all, if China is downgraded as a trading partner, some other country will likely replace it as the final assembler of cheap goods; this is already happening as firms move southward from China’s Pearl River Delta to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Nor should Americans imagine that they can instigate Polish-style worker-led regime change (and thinking of the relationship in those terms can be counterproductive). Chinese activists must meanwhile understand that U.S. organizers, pinned down at home by proliferating right to work laws and a looming Supreme Court ruling on public sector unions, will be limited in the resources they can bring to bear for the foreseeable future.

In the course of discussing the Justice Department’s approach to corporate crime, Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general perpetually on the verge of being fired, said current policy discourages “piling on” penalties. He paused to prepare his New York audience for the punchline. “The dictionary defines piling on as joining with other people in criticizing someone, usually in an unfair manner,” Rosenstein said. “I also have experience with that.” It was late on a Wednesday morning that began, like so many for Rosenstein, with President Trump tweeting about how the “Criminal Deep State”—meaning the Department of Justice, the FBI and, derivatively, Robert Mueller’s investigation—engaged in a “major SPY scandal” against him, and threatened unspecified consequences. (“What goes around comes around!”) For good measure, the president added, like a catch phrase: “WITCH HUNT!”  Rosenstein, scheduled to speak to a corporate New York audience at a forum sponsored by Bloomberg Law, responded with subliminals. The deputy attorney general had just come from the New York office of the FBI, he noted, without mentioning that it’s the favorite FBI field office of new Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. (Or, at least, it used to be.) “One of the things that sometimes gets lost in the endless commentary about law enforcement,” Rosenstein said, “is that some of the most patriotic and public-spirited Americans work alongside me in the Department of Justice.” He didn’t need to say who issues that endless commentary. “If you walk into any branch of the Department of Justice anywhere in the country,” Rosenstein continued, “you will find some of the most decent, ethical, honorable and admirable people you could ever hope to meet.” Nor did Rosenstein need to say why he felt compelled to issue basic platitudes defending the character of federal prosecutors and FBI agents. Over the past week, Trump, aided by pivotal Republican allies on Capitol Hill, has intensified his attacks on them over the Russia investigation, pushing a counternarrative of victimhood that depends on portraying Rosenstein, a Republican who Trump made deputy attorney general, and his colleagues as Democratic hacks determined to frame the president. It was only a year ago that Rosenstein, a career federal prosecutor, handed Trump a pretext for firing FBI Director James Comey, an act considered craven by many of his longtime colleagues and observers. But it wasn’t long until the ire of Trump and his allies turned on Rosenstein, who soon empanelled Mueller as special counsel over the Russia investigation. By December, House Republicans were demanding Rosenstein act against Mueller, but Rosenstein refused. Trump asked Rosenstein if he was “on my team” after the deputy attorney general had tried to get White House aid against Trump’s House GOP allies. A month later, House intelligence committee Devin Nunes had included Rosenstein in a tendentious, high-profile memorandum alleging surveillance abuses at the heart of the Russia inquiry. Nunes’ gambit failed, but the vilification of Rosenstein has continued. Last month, House conservatives drafted articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, ostensibly for stonewalling on turning over documentation related to the FBI inquiry into the Trump campaign. Trump reacted by implying, yet again, that he might fire his hand-picked deputy attorney general. All of that prompted Rosenstein, who has mostly taken a low public profile to say that the Justice Department—and, by extension, he himself—won’t be “extorted.” The political reality underlying the attacks on Rosenstein is that he oversees Mueller. Intimidating him or firing him is the threshold maneuver to rein in the special counsel. And as Trump’s new attorney, Giuliani, has taken a more pugnacious stance with Mueller, Trump has intensified a battle with the Justice Department.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The latest maneuvering by Trump’s allies to discredit the Mueller inquiry is an attempt by Nunes to get Justice Department material on an FBI informant who, starting in the summer of 2016, met with Trump campaign officials George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and Sam Clovis. U.S. intelligence officials have warned that the material could endanger the informant, who reportedly is a professor named Stefan A. Halper. Yet Trump, without evidence, has portrayed this typical investigative practice as a nefarious effort by what he called the “Obama FBI” to put “spies in my campaign”—and for a week has amplified that dubious portrayal to craft a narrative of an investigation that was politically corrupt from the start. On Thursday, he termed it “Spygate.”By resisting Nunes’ subpoena, the Justice Department once again came in the crosshairs of the House GOP and the president. Trump on Sunday “demanded” the department investigate itself over whether his campaign had been “infiltrated or surveilled.” Rosenstein quickly punted that call to the inspector general—a move that had the effect of preserving the political status quo, since the inspector general is already examining FBI and department behavior related to the 2016 election. In his New York speech on Wednesday, Rosenstein—again without ever mentioning why, or needing to—praised the inspector general’s office as part of a critical series of institutional safeguards against “wrongdoers” of the sort that Trump is seeking to highlight. He called them “nonpartisan” and lingered on the word. “The inspector general’s federal agents, attorneys, and other officials are governed by executive branch confidentiality rules. Federal statutes allow them to review material that is not appropriate for disclosure outside the Department and prohibit them from leaking,” Rosenstein said, noting that the inspector general is empowered to make criminal referrals.On Thursday, Nunes and ally Rep. Trey Gowdy will meet to discuss the Halper issue with FBI Director Chris Wray, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and senior Justice Department official Ed O’Callaghan. Rosenstein is conspicuously not attending. Nor have any Democrats been invited, which prompted Nunes’ Democratic counterpart Adam Schiff to say that the meeting is intended to ultimately deliver sensitive material on the informant“to [Trump’s] legal team,” something he called “a serious abuse of power.”Rosenstein didn’t go remotely that far, nor was he remotely explicit. The corporate-compliance portion of his remarks carved out space to praise Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. By discussing the consensus Republican territory of not overly burdening corporations, even in a criminal context, Rosenstein could inhabit a world in which he was firmly in step with the administration in which he serves. But toward the end of his 23-minute speech, the deputy attorney general sounded like a man at the end of his tether. At times appearing as if he was describing himself, Rosenstein nodded to the “discipline” and the “need” necessary, “when we make an allegation of wrongdoing, to prove it beyond any reasonable doubt to a judge and jury with credible, admissible evidence. That gives us a very powerful incentive to seek the truth, and only the truth, wherever it may lead us.” Once more he let the contrast hang in the air. Rosenstein quoted legendary attorney general, Nuremberg war-crimes prosecutor, and Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson about building a “Cathedral of Justice,” a legacy he described his colleagues as carefully protecting and strengthening. It was both a conspicuous departure for a speech about the Justice Department’s relationship with corporate America, and an inevitable one. "},
 {'title': 'Cynthia Nixon Campaign: We Got More Small-Dollar Donations in One Day Than Cuomo Did in 7 Years',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Cynthia Nixon has already raked in more small-dollar contributions in one day than her rival Gov. Andrew Cuomo did in seven years, the star actress’ campaign announced Thursday. According to the data, the newly minted Democratic primary challenger to Cuomo, who announced her candidacy on Monday, received 2,214 contributions of less than $200 in just one day.Using an analysis of contributions to Gov. Cuomo from 2011 to the present, the Nixon campaign determined that her small-donation total in just a single day exceeded that of his over seven years (approximately 1,369 donations). The New York Times reported that Cuomo has raised a vast majority of money from donations exceeding $1,000.“Andrew Cuomo has built a $31 million war chest from wealthy corporate interests, lobbyists, and billionaires,” Nixon's campaign manager Nicole Aro said in a statement. “And with just  0.1 percent of his support coming from small donations from everyday New Yorkers, that tells you exactly the chance that Cuomo will care about your concerns: 0.1 percent.”While a recent poll found that Nixon trailed Cuomo massively among Democratic voters in the state, candidates have found enormous success recently from using the small-donor model. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) famously rode a wave of small donations through the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.In particular, Democratic candidates like Nixon have been using the fundraising service ActBlue to raise money in recent races. And in February of this year, the website announced that candidates and groups using the service had in fact raised more than in February 2016, which of course, was a presidential election year. "},
 {'title': 'The Newest Threat to Manafort Comes From Inside His Own Family',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It might feel like a lifetime ago. You might have missed it, with all of the other major breaks in the far-flung investigations into Trumpworld. But last week, Paul Manafort’s former son-in-law and business partner, Jeffrey Yohai, reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors in Los Angeles. And that has the potential to significantly increase Manafort’s legal risk.Yohai pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to real estate transactions and misrepresenting his income and assets to obtain an American Express “Black Card.” Yohai has agreed to cooperate with, and provide information to, federal and state authorities placing yet another Manafort insider in the government’s back pocket. In order to understand how Yohai might impact the government’s ability to build a case against Manafort, it’s helpful to review the known business dealings involving Manafort and Yohai.Starting as early as 2014 and continuing through 2016, the Manafort family financed Yohai’s real estate development projects in Los Angeles. In an apparent attempt to take advantage of soaring demand for luxury properties, Yohai purchased vacant land and older homes in L.A.’s most exclusive neighborhoods with the hope of building modern houses that would fetch tens of millions of dollars.Examination of property records and court filings show that Yohai struggled to move any of the four Los Angeles projects to completion or sale. As late as March 30, 2016 (the day after the Trump campaign named Paul Manafort Campaign Convention Manager), Manafort transferred $2.7 million to an entity controlled by Yohai to finance an acquisition of an $8.5 million home in the ritzy Bel-Air neighborhood. “A key question is whether Yohai dragged Manafort into financial trouble or the scrutiny of Manafort’s finances independently made it difficult for Manafort to continue financing the L.A. projects.”Manafort was swiftly pushed out of the Trump campaign in August 2016 after The New York Times published its “Black Ledger” story connecting Manafort to illicit payments in Ukraine. At roughly the same time, lenders filed notices of default against the four LLCs connected to Yohai’s L.A. development projects. In December, Manafort, his wife and daughter filed documents with the county clerk in Los Angeles asserting that their investments in these LLCs were secured loans—a status that would give the Manaforts’ interests \xa0priority over other lenders and investors. The next day, the same LLCs filed for bankruptcy protection. In bankruptcy court, the U.S. Trustee tasked with administering the proceeding has argued that the investments were not secured loans but equity investments without any priority. Manafort appears to have played an integral role in the projects. Manafort, his wife and daughter were the primary investors in three of the four developments. The actor Dustin Hoffman and his son invested $3 million in the fourth. Manafort and Yohai are 50-50 partners in Baylor Holding, LLC, which was the ultimate majority owner of all four L.A. properties.Hacked text messages show that Manafort and Yohai worked closely together long before the financial trouble started. “You realize dad and jeff are business partners and there[’]s no sneaking $1 million past the other one,” Jessica Manafort wrote to her sister, Andrea Manafort Shand. In another message, Jessica wrote, Manafort “flew out to california and helped Jeff completely reorganized and set up his business.” A key question is whether Yohai dragged Manafort into financial trouble or the scrutiny of Manafort’s finances independently made it difficult for Manafort to continue financing the L.A. projects. Yohai already appeared to be financially overextended in 2016. In the same year, a fashion photographer accused Yohai in a lawsuit of misappropriating $3 million and running a Ponzi scheme, he attempted to take out a mortgage against a property owned by his sister-in-law and mother-in-law, and Andrea wrote to her sister that Yohai “forged my fucking name... Trying to take out a loan on Baxter,” referring to Andrea’s Manhattan condo. However, the timing of the defaults on the L.A. projects and Manafort’s $16 million East Coast borrowing spree coincides with increased media attention of Manafort’s finances. It stands to reason that questions about the provenance of Manafort’s wealth would limit his ability to continue to finance investments. The special counsel’s indictments of Manafort allege that he was in the habit of buying real estate with laundered funds wired directly from secret offshore bank accounts. It’s possible that Manafort used similar strategies with respect to the L.A. properties and put an end to such transfers as soon as the “Black Ledger” story was in national headlines.“We can say with confidence that Yohai worked closely with Manafort on the L.A. development projects for about three years.”Manafort is the subject of parallel criminal prosecutions in Washington, D.C., and the Eastern District of Virginia. Robert Mueller’s prosecutors appear to be building a strong case focused on money laundering, bank fraud and FARA violations. Manafort’s business partner Rick Gates is already cooperating with authorities. So what does news that Jeff Yohai is pleading guilty and cooperating mean for Manafort and the Russia investigation, generally? While we don’t have an inside direct line to the man in question—Yohai reached out to 377UNION proposing an interview in November 2017, but subsequently ceased communication and the interview did not move forward—we can say with confidence that Yohai worked closely with Manafort on the L.A. development projects for about three years. Yohai likely knows details about the money flows and bank loans that were taken out over this time period. However, it appears that he was not involved in Manafort’s international business dealings. While Rick Gates was involved in the origination of the funds in Ukraine, wire transfers from Cyprus and failure to disclosure international bank accounts, Yohai primarily received funds from Manafort for use in real estate development.

 {'title': 'It’s Not a Liberal Fantasy to Ask if Trump Committed Treason',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Under the Constitution an individual commits treason if the nation is at war and the person provides aid and comfort to the enemy. \xa0This is an impeachable offense, committed by word or deed. It's one that individuals need to start grappling with seriously because it is not some far-fetched liberal fantasy to conclude that Donald Trump may have committed treason. In fact, the case is fairly simple to make.The U.S. intelligence community’s assessment of Russian activities in the 2016 presidential election concluded that Russia tried to influence the outcome through the dissemination and weaponization of information stolen from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The thirteen Russian operatives indicted by the Special Counsel for waging a disinformation campaign through our social media platforms and other internet media, described their activity as “information warfare against the United States of America.” \xa0The question we must now ask is were these Russian cyber attacks merely crimes on a massive scale, or, as cyber expert George Lucas asks, do they represent something different — acts of war? And if a state of war existed between the two nations, could the actions and comments of Donald Trump and his campaign officials therefore be considered treasonable? The first question is highly technical. International IT security experts have developed several analytical models to assess whether or not the damage caused by a cyber attack rises to the level of an armed attack. They have developed an “effects-based” approach, a model which gives consideration to the overall effects and consequences of a cyber attack on a victim state. For example, a cyber manipulation of information across a state’s banking and financial institutions that significantly disrupts commerce would be viewed as an armed attack. Another model is one of “strict liability” that would automatically deem any cyber attack against a state’s critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on its potential for severe consequences. The validity of these models has been confirmed by the Pentagon’s usage of them in its recent draft recommendations on how the U.S. would respond to significant foreign cyber attacks. Based on either one of these models, Russia’s cyber attack was an act of war. They significantly disrupted and damaged our Constitutional infrastructure in an attempt to undermine the foundation of U.S. democracy. They were of sufficient scope, duration and intensity to deem them armed attacks. Clearly, they meet the international criteria of an armed attack and an act of war against the United States.Now for the second question. With the United States placed in a state of war by Russia, Trump’s actions and comments and those of his top campaign officials during this time must be closely scrutinized. \xa0What we have gleaned from public reports is instructive:On June 9, 2016, Trump campaign officials met in Trump Tower with a group of Russian operatives that promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s support for Trump;Yesterday, Senators released Donald Trump Jr.’s \xa0testimony before the Judiciary Committee in which he did not recall telling his father about that meeting, leaving open the possibility, if not probability, that, in fact, he did;On July 27, 2016, following revelations of the Democratic National Committee hacking and possible Russian involvement, Trump famously encouraged Russian hackers to break into Clinton’s computers to obtain emails Clinton had deleted on her private server; On or around August 17, 2016, Republican candidate Donald Trump and his top campaign officials received the first periodic briefing from U.S. intelligence officials. In that briefing they were informed by the FBI that Russia might attempt to infiltrate the Trump campaign; and,After the “Access Hollywood” tape was released, Trump encouraged voters to read the Russian-hacked emails that were published by WikiLeaks on the internet and began to praise WikiLeaks on a daily basis. In total, Trump referred to WikiLeaks by name 137 times in public appearances and media interviews. \xa0Trump’s comments and actions during this time are damning. He continually called for release of Russian cyber hacked documents that were intended to influence the outcome of the election. Based upon the preponderance of these known facts, it would be stunningly feasible to answer “yes” to the following: Did Trump assist Russia in its conduct of cyber war against the United States? \xa0Did the cumulative effect of the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal actions result in aiding and abetting a hostile nation? \xa0Did Trump’s actions rise to the level of giving aid and comfort to an enemy? \xa0These are extremely important issues and I suspect both Congress and the Special Counsel's office will eventually be alarmed by the answers they find.

 {'title': 'Democrats Hate Gerrymandering—Except When They Get to Do It',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "With Republicans clinging to the House of Representatives facing a blue midterm wave, and the 2020 census right around the corner, gerrymandering has suddenly become a hot topic. Democrats are particularly worried that Republican-drawn districts will be too high a wall to breach, no matter how hard they campaign, or how big the wave. “In 2006, a roughly five-and-a-half-point lead in the national popular vote was enough for Democrats to pick up 31 seats and win back the House majority they had lost to Newt Gingrich,” write Michael Li and Laura Royden of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. “But\xa0our research\xa0shows that a similar margin of victory in 2018 would most likely net Democrats only 13 seats, leaving the Republicans firmly in charge.”Imagine a scenario where 2016 (with Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote, but losing the election) is immediately followed by a midterm election where Democrats feel just as cheated. This kind of repeated failure would breed more than just frustration on the left—it would lead to the kind of paranoia that defined the right for the Obama years. Of course, even if 2020 is an especially good year for Democrats, giving them control of the House of Representatives and the state legislatures that draw the congressional boundaries, gerrymandering won’t end—it will just shift to benefit them. If you don’t believe me—if you think this is a sin exclusive to Republicans—consider the places I have lived.I’m from western Maryland, the 6th Congressional district that was for many years represented by conservative Republican Roscoe Bartlett (the Supreme Court is currently looking into this). This is culturally more akin to West Virginia or central Pennsylvania than it is to the Maryland of the Baltimore-Washington nexus (I went to college in West Virginia, and my mom now lives in Pennsylvania). This point is buttressed by the fact that Bartlett is now a survivalist living in the Mountain State, and that his heir apparent, former Maryland State Senator Alex Mooney, is now West Virginia Congressman Mooney. “It’s asking a lot for a political party, having finally regained power, to do unto others as they would have others do unto them.”Why did Bartlett go off the grid and why did Mooney have to move across the James Rumsey bridge? Because Democrats decided to give themselves another Congressional seat. As Mother Jones describes it, “Democrats added a strange-looking appendage to the district, reaching all the way down into the affluent Washington DC, suburbs to scoop up Democratic voters. More than 360,000 people were moved out of the district, and nearly as many were moved in. It went from solidly Republican to reliably Democratic; the\xa0Cook Political Report\xa0identified it as the biggest district swing in the country.”Today, I live in Alexandria, Virginia, a city that Democrats dominate. In May of 2009, however, one Republican managed to get elected to the six-member City Council. This was apparently too much for Democrats to stomach. One month after his election, the City Council voted to move municipal elections from May to November—an attempt to squash the chances that Republicans could compensate for their numerical disadvantages by organizing to win low-turnout elections. It worked.But this isn’t peculiar to states where I have resided. The likely Democratic gubernatorial nominee in New Mexico, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, is telling supporters that one selling point for her leaving Congress to run for governor is that “you would be in charge of redistricting.” Meanwhile, the state’s Democratic secretary of state, Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver,\xa0was working to change other rules—an attempt to prevent a Republican Congressman running for governor from transferring federal money to his gubernatorial account. Having failed at that, Oliver is now working to bring back straight party voting, which would benefit Democrats in New Mexico. These were, of course, blatant, anti-democratic, power grabs. But my point isn’t to say “Both sides do it, therefore there’s nothing we can do!” Politics has to be taken out of the drawing of district lines, to the extent that it can be. The question that everyone is grappling with is how to do that. From proportional representation to nonpartisan redistricting commissions (a handful of states have appointed such commissions, and after the 2020 census, we’ll see how they do), there’s no lack of proposed solutions. One friend of mine thinks the answer is to expand the number of representatives in the House from 435 to 1,000. \xa0Who knows?Whatever the solution is, the actual problem is more fundamental than gerrymandering. The fact that we at the point where something must be done to address a problem that has been around since Elbridge Gerry suggests that there is something more deep-seated at play. The authors of Why Democracies Die write about the need for mutual toleration and for people in power to exercise “forbearance”—which basically means voluntarily deciding not to run up the score on your opponent—even if you have the power to do so.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Trump Adviser Peter Navarro Slams Steve Mnuchin as ‘Neville Chamberlain’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Fresh off their heated, “fuck”-encrusted shouting match in China, tensions and policy fissures between Donald Trump advisers Steve Mnuchin and Peter Navarro are at an all-time high, with the former believing the latter to be a crank and a recurring nuisance, and the latter accusing the former of trade capitulation akin to Nazi appeasement, according to sources who’ve spoken with both men.Last week, tensions and ideological warfare between Mnuchin, President Trump’s Treasury secretary, and Navarro, the president’s hawkish top trade adviser whom Trump has dubbed “my Peter,” spilled into public view after multiple news outlets reported what was described to The Daily Beast as a “screaming match” between the two senior officials during an official trip to China earlier this month. Navarro, a nationalist and protectionist hardliner on China and trade, and Mnuchin, a key figure from the free-trader camp of the Trump administration, had been in conflict for weeks over trade negotiations with China. According to those close to Navarro, he views Mnuchin as one of the leading impediments to taking a tough stance toward China in ongoing negotiations—something the president campaigned on but has since taken varying degrees of softer stances about while in office.Recently, the pair have fought over Trump’s declared openness to relaxing punitive measures on Chinese electronics firm ZTE Technologies—measures that were supposed to penalize ZTE for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and other countries. Relatedly, Navarro believes the trade framework Mnuchin has been negotiating with Chinese government officials will inevitably undermine the president’s “America First” promises.As for Mnuchin’s positions, Navarro has—according to multiple sources who spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity—privately nicknamed Mnuchin “Neville Chamberlain” (in reference to the Conservative British prime minister famous for his foreign policy of appeasement toward Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler) and likened the economic threat from China to that of fascist dictator Hitler.Mnuchin is sympathetic to free trade and internationalist principles, much like former top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn—another Trumpworld figure with whom Navarro ideologically and personally clashed, and believed was an even bigger, savvier “globalist” danger than Mnuchin. Navarro, on the other hand, is an author of a book titled Death by China.“It’s no secret there’s a difference in strategy and perspective on the trade issue between two camps—one is Navarro and [Robert] Lighthizer, and the other is Larry Kudlow and Mnuchin. It’s just a fact of life,” Stephen Moore, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a former Trump adviser, told The Daily Beast. “And Trump has said he wants both sides represented at the table… I feel like the press has been blowing this out of proportion. They’re all trying to get a better deal from China. They want to get China to buy more American products and reduce their tariffs… It’s a question of tactically how you get there. It’s just two camps within the Trump contingent. And Trump has said he wants that.”“This is not what [Trump] needs right now, more palace-intrigue horseshit.”Blown out of proportion or not, Navarro’s animus toward Mnuchin’s policy preferences has reached the level at which one is apparently comparing the other to a Nazi appeaser. A senior White House official described the dynamic between the two as a “Cold War that became hot,” especially during the China visit. Other administration officials simply expressed dismay at the feud, with one noting with a sigh that “this is not what [Trump] needs right now, more palace-intrigue horseshit.”According to three knowledgeable sources, Navarro has privately fingered Mnuchin and his team—including Tony Sayegh, the Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for public affairs—as the ones orchestrating an aggressive leak and smear campaign against him in recent weeks. An administration official familiar with the Trump trade team, however, laughed off the notion and contended that it was Navarro who had brought the unwanted attention and spotlight upon himself.In the past few weeks, it hasn’t only been Mnuchin with whom Navarro has had harsh words. Sources familiar with his internal confrontations tell The Daily Beast that Navarro has, for instance, also engaged in heated disagreement with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, among other top officials. Even those close to, or allied with, Navarro will concede that he has long been an island in the Trump administration, exhibiting often woefully lacking bedside manner.But according to administration and Trumpworld sources, Navarro still feels comfortable in his position and professional standing in large part because Trump’s instincts about China and trade policies more closely mirror his than Mnuchin’s.“Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion,” the president declared on Twitter on Wednesday morning.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

As one source close to Trump put it, the president told his Treasury secretary to “pump the brakes.” "},
 {'title': 'Kellyanne Conway, Conservative Snowflake',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Conservatives never tire of calling liberals “snowflakes,” but this Kellyanne Conway-Dana Bash kerfuffle proves once again that America’s most fragile snowflakes are conservatives.Sunday morning on CNN, Bash asked Conway about the anti-Trump tweets issued by her husband, George, and Conway went ballistic. “It’s fascinating to me that CNN would go there,” Conway said. “But it’s very good for the whole world to just witness that it’s now fair game how people’s spouses and significant others may differ with them.” On and on she went. She made it a gender issue when Bash said she’d have asked the same thing of a man and Conway countered that Bash would not have. Great TV, and in some ways a good answer. Conway has a point that people in public life shouldn’t be held responsible for things their spouses say. And it sure looked prepared, as if she’d just been waiting for someone in the fake-news game to ask it so she could unload and sent the Twitter needles into the red.But come on. It was a totally reasonable and legitimate question, as Bash told my colleague Matt Wilstein Monday . Kellyanne Conway was relying on your average CNN viewer having no idea who her husband is. And indeed, if George Conway were some legal services attorney trying to save poor people from their eviction notices who had nothing to do with politics, then Bash’s question would have been out of line.But George Conway is an intensely political figure. He’s been a conservative power-lawyer in Washington for more than two decades. He was reportedly considered for more than one top spot in the Trump administration. Most interestingly, he was a key player in the late 1990s in the laying of the famous perjury trap for Bill Clinton. He was one of the right-wing so-called “elves,” a group that also included Ann Coulter, trying to find ways to lay Clinton low. In early 1998, Conway found one. He was present at a fateful dinner in Philadelphia where he was one of three outside lawyers who met with a deputy of independent counsel Ken Starr and told him the whole tale of Clinton’s involvement with Monica Lewinsky. In other words, were it not for George Conway and the two other lawyers at that dinner, Ken Starr might never have known the name Lewinsky, and the whole impeachment saga never would have happened. (Kellyanne and George knew each other in those days and married in 2001.)If a guy like that is sending out anti-Trump tweets while his wife is going on TV serially offering alternative facts in defense of the President, it’s bound to pique the interest of people around Washington. I don’t know if you’d call it Capital-N News, but it’s certainly fair game for an end-of-segment question on a Sunday show.Let’s reverse the situation. Hillary Clinton is president. Brian Fallon is her regular defender on the Sunday shows. I don’t know Fallon’s wife. I don’t even know if he has one. But let’s say hypothetically his wife a) exists and b) is a big shot liberal lawyer who was trying to help get George W. Bush impeached in 2007. And let’s say she had tweeted out a number of anti-Clinton statements suggesting (as Conway has) that she suspected President Hillary may be guilty of certain crimes.Would conservatives really not have drawn attention to that? They’d have gone nuts over it! Brian Fallon’s wife would be some minor (or perhaps major) Fox villainess. And surely during some Fox News appearance, Chris Wallace would have asked Fallon about it. And I think I know what Fallon would have said. She’s her own person, he would have said calmly, and being married doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. Next question.That is exactly what Conway should have done. But instead she turned it into a thing. Why?If there’s one thing conservatives hate about liberal America, it’s what they might call the grievance industry. The way everybody’s so sensitive these days. No one can take a joke. Everything’s an -ism. Sexism, racism, genderism, sizeism, you name it. Everybody’s feelings are so damn sensitive. People just need to get over it.Conservatives walk around in a state of perpetual rage about this. But the second they have a chance to use the grievance industry for their own purposes, they pounce. It’s an old trick they pull out of the hat when they’re desperate. Remember in 2004 when John Kerry supposedly \xa0“attacked” Dick Cheney’s daughter Mary for being a lesbian during the last presidential debate that year? Moderator Bob Schieffer had asked President Bush if homosexuality was a matter of choice. He waffled so as not to offend the medievalist caucus.

If he meant anything charged by it, he was pointing out the hypocrisy that existed in the Cheneys embracing their gay daughter on a personal level even as their ticket sought reelection while using bigotry against gay people as a wedge issue in state after state, which the GOP was doing that year. The Cheneys and the RNC must have sensed that this stood a chance of gaining traction, because they immediately mounted the “how dare he?” horse.That’s all this is. The walls are closing in on the White House, and Conway needed a change of subject. So she takes massive umbrage at a totally fair question to paint herself as the victim of a sexism that doesn’t exist. That’s worse than liberal snowflakeism. At least liberal snowflakeism is felt to be real. Conservative snowflakeism is manufactured to rally the base. As the base is about to need a lot more rallying in the coming months, I think we can expect to see plenty more snowfall on the right between now and November."},
 {'title': 'How Trump’s NASA Nominee Used a Nonprofit He Ran to Benefit Himself',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Rep. James Bridenstine (R-Okla.) is a former Navy pilot with virtually no management experience in any large organization. But the Oklahoma Republican has been tapped by President Donald Trump to take over the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a federal agency with a budget of $18.5 billion, 18,000 federal workers, and over 60,000 contract employees. For this lack of technical experience—along with a skepticism of climate change and opposition to LGBT rights — Bridenstine has faced sharp criticism on the Hill. But another issue may soon end up complicating his nomination.An investigation and review of public records by the Project On Government Oversight shows that, prior to his time in Congress, Bridenstine led a small non-profit organization into hefty financial losses. Some of the losses involved the use of the non-profit’s resources to benefit a company that Bridenstine simultaneously co-owned and in which he’d invested substantial sums of his own money.Bridenstine, whose bid to be NASA’s next leader was advanced this week by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has vehemently denied mismanaging the non-profit: the Tulsa Air and Space Museum. His stake in the separate company, the Rocket Racing League, has been well known. But the fact that he was using the Museum’s resources to benefit that company has not previously been covered by the press and now raises red flags for tax law experts."This is a classic example of the use of a charity\'s assets for private benefit," said Marc Owens, an expert on tax law at the firm Loeb & Loeb and former head of the Internal Revenue Services\'s non-profit compliance division. "This could have jeopardized the Museum\'s status as a tax-exempt organization" under the IRS code since its resources were used to provide him a significant private benefit.Evidence of Bridenstine’s self-dealing dates back to December 2008, when the Museum, under his leadership, put its own cash reserves on the line to bring the struggling Rocket Racing League — a company set up to race rocket-powered aircraft before live audiences — to an air show in Tulsa in 2010. It was the first and only air show the Museum ever organized. And though it was billed as a stop on the League’s 2010 “World Exhibition Tour,” there was no tour beyond Tulsa. The show was a boost for Rocket Racing League, which had, to that point, disappointed investors and struggled with technological mishaps. At the event, the \xa0Rocket Racing League would have more than one racer in the air—one of whom was from Bridenstine’s own team. Using rocket-powered aircraft, pilots flew through virtual 3-D rings on an aerial race course that could be seen on a pilot’s display. The League aimed for a NASCAR-like experience for spectators. But the air show was a financial loser for the Museum, costing it about $20,000 \xa0more than it generated, according to IRS filings. This, and other spending initiatives put the Museum—which typically had annual revenues around $1 million—$308,000 in debt in 2010. Two years earlier, it had run a surplus of $73,000. A big chunk of the expenses associated with the air show are left undetailed by the Museum in its annual filing with the Internal Revenue Service. There were roughly $372,000 in payments related to the air show described only as “other direct expenses.”On its 2010 annual filing with the IRS, the Museum checked “no” in response to a question whether it was a “party to a business transaction with… an entity” owned by an officer of the non-profit. And when asked by the Project On Government Oversight whether Bridenstine directed payments to his rocket team or the League, the Museum did not respond.The League itself no longer exists, having gone out of business in 2012, the year Bridenstine was elected to Congress.“Whether the Rocket Racing League was or was not paid directly by the Museum would be relevant to report,” Owens said. He added that not enough is known to say whether the Museum correctly answered the question. Regardless, the expenditures on the event itself appeared to be "a misuse of the charity\'s assets." since the event was organized “to benefit his company,” Owens said. \xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Bridenstine was pushed out of the Museum in August 2010, just months after the air show. His tenure as its executive director proved controversial when he ran for Congress in 2012, with some members of the Museum’s board publicly critical of him for his handling of the books. “The finances and certainly the financial reporting were arguably the worst they had been in recent years,” board member and former petroleum executive Jim Bertelsmeyer told The Tulsa World. “While I respect Jim’s service to our Country as an aviator, I can’t imagine how he is qualified to run a Congressional District if, in my judgment, he can’t effectively manage our Air and Space Museum.”In a statement, the chairman of the Museum’s board came to Bridenstine’s defense, praising the air show event and saying he was “not terminated” but “voluntarily resigned…in order to follow his orders in the Navy Reserve.”Bridenstine’s congressional communications director said, “The concerns you have raised were used as a line of political attacks during the 2012 election cycle, and were fully refuted by the Tulsa Air and Space Museum and Planetarium Board.”Bridenstine, however, left the Museum at the same time as two employees he’d hired—the financial controller and the director of marketing. Unlike Bridenstine, they were not members of the Navy Reserve. A source familiar with Bridenstine’s departure, who requested anonymity out of fear of angering Bridenstine, said that the board effectively requested their resignation.A MOVE TO THE D.C.Bridenstine was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2012. He brought with him the Museum’s former director of marketing, who is now one of his top congressional staffers and who would move over to NASA if he is confirmed.Bridenstine was tapped to head NASA in the fall of 2017. And with NASA’s Acting Administrator’s looming retirement at the end of the month, pressure is building for someone to take NASA’s reins. But the agency faces especially sensitive challenges regarding its spending, its watchdog wrote in November 2017, making it vital that the next administrator has a strong track record in running large organizations. And staff on the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over NASA, have asked Museum to provide information on its financial relationship with the League. So far, the Museum has been unresponsive. What is publicly known is that Bridenstine’s relationship with the League dates back to 2006, when, according to the Greater Tulsa Reporter, he first bought shares in the privately-held company at a severely-discounted rate when he was still a Navy pilot. Bridenstine also assembled one of the league’s half-dozen teams, naming it after himself: Bridenstine Rocket Racing. In a July 2008 article, before he started working at the Museum, The New York Times wrote that Bridenstine “was drawn to the challenge of a new kind of flying and what he saw as the financial opportunities of being involved with a sport from its inception.” He told The Tulsa World that he sold four houses he owned in California and a ranchette in Nevada to raise the money to buy shares in the League. And he didn’t let go of them when he turned his attention to Congress. In 2012, as a candidate for the House, Bridenstine listed his ownership in the League as between $50,001 and $100,000, according to his financial disclosure form. But the company was struggling financially. While the League brought in millions of dollars in venture capital, year after year, it had to delay plans to start exhibitions and races.After attracting $5.5 million in investments in July 2009, it was under severe pressure to show substantial progress in its operations. That November, Bridenstine met with the League’s CEO to convince him to have an event in Tulsa, according to The Tulsa World. In February 2010, the Tulsa Museum announced it would partner with the League for the first exhibition flight of two rocket racers flying at the same time.The goal, according to Space.com, was to "build up the league\'s fan base, in addition to perfecting operations and technologies, before the league\'s official launch in 2012."Instead of officially launching in 2012, however, it filed for dissolution. UNDER SCRUTINYDuring a November 2017 Senate hearing on his nomination, Bridenstine was asked about the financial losses detailed in the Museum’s annual IRS filings.He gave various answers. To Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), he said, “there was a noncash loss from the depreciation of capital assets. And from a document based on that, [my political opponents] tried to accuse me of having lost money for the Museum, which is absolutely not the case.” An analysis done by congressional staff and obtained by POGO shows, in fact, the Museum ran large financial deficits under Bridenstine.At the same hearing, Bridenstine gave Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida), a different response: “We had a number of big, big projects that we were investing in. And yes, we had cash reserves to do that.”Some of those projects, according to Bridenstine, included “an effort to acquire a retiring space shuttle for the City of Tulsa that would be at the Tulsa Air and Space Museum.” That effort failed.The other big project, he said, was the 2010 air show.Additional scrutiny over his past managerial record, could complicate Bridenstine’s nomination prospects. He has an array of backers, from former Speaker of the House and space aficionado Newt Gingrich to the conservative Family Research Council. But even his supporters have raised red flags about his resume. In an 2017 email exchange between Gingrich and NASA consultant Charles Miller—which was obtained by POGO but first reported by Politico—Miller told Gingrich: “Assuming we get Bridenstine for Admin (fingers crossed), we are going to need a NASA Deputy Administrator that has Bridenstine’s back, and who has skills/strengths that offsets Bridenstine’s weaknesses.”Miller wrote that Bridenstine does not have “significant knowledge and experience with how NASA works” or “Deep technical knowledge in aerospace systems.” “Bridenstine has little” of either, Miller wrote.'},
 {'title': 'The Republican Party’s 2018 Game Plan: Paint Democrats as the ‘Deplorables’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Trump trumps hate. That was the midterm message workshopped by RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel recently. “Democrats hate our President more than they love our country,” she tweeted. Four days later, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker jumped aboard the anti-hate bandwagon after an embarrassing loss in a state Supreme Court race. \xa0\xa0“The Far Left is driven by anger & hatred,” he warned his followers, painting an ominous picture of a #BlueWave. The following weekend, he doubled down, urging supporters to “Counter the the anger and hatred of the Left.”The intent seems clear: delegitimize not just your political opponents, but the voters who support them. It’s a particularly poisonous strategy. And it won’t work. \xa0After all, has any politician ever benefited from speculating about the other side’s supporters? It’s not just a Republican problem. Then-candidate Obama’s comment about people clinging to guns and religion (and, less widely reported, to anti-trade and anti-immigrant sentiment) was in some ways prescient. But it wasn’t one of the finer moments of his campaign. Similarly, it’s hard to argue that Steve Bannon and Roger Stone are anything but deplorable—but Hillary Clinton’s decision to throw 50 percent of Trump supporters in the basket with them was almost certainly excessive and definitely unwise. Ditto Mitt Romney’s remarks about the 47 percent of Americans dependent on government programs who would vote for a Democrat no matter what. Or the epithets hurled at progressives so frequently they’re now barely even considered gaffes. (As someone who was proud to serve America’s first Marxist-Maoist-New-Black-Panther-secret-Muslim-terrorist-closeted-homosexual-born-in-Kenya president, I’ve heard them all) Yet even in the swamp of the right-wing echo chamber, McDaniel and Walkers’ line of attack is newly noxious. The 47 percent were at least, in Romney’s telling, redeemable. A booster shot of trickle-down economics, a hearty does of deregulation, and the poor would be pulling themselves up by their bootstraps in no time. The Marxists and New Black Panthers were less easily saved, but they were damned by their choices rather their character traits. Clinton’s deplorables, meanwhile, included “some” who were “irredeemable” and “not America” — but this carried the surprisingly hopeful implication that much of the basket would see the light.McDaniel and Walkers are not as sympathetic to the opposition. In the latest version of “Why doesn’t everyone vote Republican?,” Democrats (and plenty of independents) aren’t just misguided. They’re unfixable. Their anger stems not from policy or even philosophy, but from deep, unquenchable rage. Democrats are not just making bad choices. They’re bad apples. There’s no reasoning with them, and so they deserve to be ignored. To put it in terms less Orwellian and more Swiftian: haters gonna hate. It’s no surprise that GOP leaders who have spent decades undermining the legitimacy of Democratic politicians would now try the same thing with the rest of us. After all, if approximately half the voters are temperamentally unfit to fulfill their duties as citizens, it’s only reasonable to gerrymander them into non-competitive districts or refuse to hold special elections they might win. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the dismissiveness as just another cynical political tactic. There’s no reason to believe the Republican elites of the Trump era have spent much time trying to empathize with voters who disagree with them. When they describe “The Left” as a political bogeyman— one out not just to win elections but to destroy America— it’s best to take their rhetoric both seriously and literally. Because despite their misunderstanding of Democrats’ motivations, McDaniel and Walker are right about at least two things. First, irrational anger and hatred really are poisoning our politics. And second, fanning the flames should come with a political price. Which is why progressives shouldn’t shy away from the argument the GOP suddenly seems eager to have. Want to claim a striker in Oklahoma is anti-American, just because she believes you shouldn’t have to work three jobs to afford to teach? Then go ahead and defend that position. Think David Hogg is more deplorable than David Duke?

We can unequivocally condemn white supremacists and neo-Nazis without placing every Trump supporter in that group. Respecting voters, rather than dismissing them, is one of those happy strategies that is both morally right and politically sound. It improves the odds of a #BlueWave in November. It drains some of the poison from our politics. It might even be enough to trump Trump. "},
 {'title': 'House Intel Votes to Release GOP Report on Russia Probe Findings',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines on Thursday to release the Republicans’ final report on the committee’s Russia investigation, which argued in part that there was no evidence to suggest that Trump associates colluded with Russian operatives to tilt the 2016 election.The report is expected to contradict a key finding of the special counsel’s probe. Last month, Mueller’s team indicted the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll-farm that spearheaded efforts to impersonate Americans on social media to spread Russian propaganda, and 13 individuals allegedly associated with those activities. While Mueller’s indictment said the Internet Research Agency’s efforts were directed toward helping Trump, the intelligence committee’s summary describes the intention as spreading “distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.”According to a summary released by the committee’s GOP majority, the report does, however, fault members of the Trump campaign in what essentially amounts to a slap on the wrist. Communication between some Trump associates and WikiLeaks, the group that released hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign, was “ill-advised,” the report states.“Possible Russian efforts to set up a ‘back channel’ with Trump associates after the election suggest the absence of collusion during the campaign, since the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a ‘back channel’ unnecessary,” the summary states.The document also references former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow. The trip was not on behalf of the Trump campaign, the summary states, but Page provided “seemingly incomplete accounts of his activity in Moscow.”The president’s former national-security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, is also mentioned in the summary. The committee’s Republicans concluded that the FBI “did not detect any deception” on Flynn’s part, even though he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Republicans on the panel also concluded that while the U.S. intelligence community “employed proper analytic tradecraft” when it crafted its assessment on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, it “did not employ proper analytic tradecraft” when it evaluated Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “strategic intentions.”Those intentions, the intelligence community report stated, were to help then-candidate Donald Trump and harm Hillary Clinton’s electoral chances. Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), the Republican who led the committee’s Russia investigation, told The Daily Beast last week that it was still possible that Putin preferred Trump.The authors of the report also made a series of recommendations for federal officials, including the use of mandatory polygraph tests for “all non-confirmed political appointees that have top secret clearances” as part of an effort to crack down on individuals suspected of leaking classified information to the news media. The summary also states that Congress should consider passing legislation to “increase the penalties” for leaks. It names James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, has having “provided inconsistent testimony to the committee about his contacts with the media.”Democrats have contended that the Republicans’ findings are incomplete, and that they shut down the investigation before interviewing key witnesses as part of an effort to shield Trump politically.“Adoption of this flawed report will do little to advance our understanding of the Russian attack on our democracy in the 2016 elections, but it will please President Donald Trump and end the unpleasant task of investigating the President’s campaign and his own conduct, a duty that has apparently proven too onerous or perilous to be continued,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the intelligence committee’s top Democrat, said ahead of the committee’s vote to release the GOP report.The final report will be released once it goes through a declassification process. The committee’s Democrats have vowed to continue investigating the Russia-related issues, even without support from the panel’s Republicans.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen was in communication with the then-presidential candidate the day Cohen wired hush money to Stormy Daniels, according to previously unreported tweets.If Cohen was being truthful in his tweets, it means that he and Trump were in close contact on the day Cohen finalized\xa0payments to the adult film star, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\xa0The Wall Street Journal\xa0reported\xa0that Cohen “missed two deadlines earlier that month to make\xa0the $130,000 payment\xa0to Ms. Clifford because he couldn’t reach Mr. Trump in the hectic final days of the presidential campaign,” citing a source familiar with the matter.\xa0In fact, according to Cohen’s own tweets, he was in contact with Trump on the very day the hush-money deal was signed and finalized. On Oct. 27, 2016, Cohen wired $130,000 to Daniels as part of the hush money agreement. The next day, Oct. 28, Cohen signed the agreement, according to court documents (PDF). That same day, The Hollywood Reporter posted a viral video of a homeless woman named Denise Scott who was assaulted while trying to keep vandals from defacing Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. “Hey, where’s Donald at?” said one of the men harassing her. Cohen sent a host of tweets about the story and asked for help finding the woman. He did so, he explained, at the behest of his boss.“This is one task given to me by @realDonaldTrump that needs to be accomplished quickly,” he wrote at 11:38 p.m. on Oct. 28. Cohen also promised that Trump had a present for Scott. “.@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her…” he tweeted at 6:28 p.m. that same day. When an account called @LowRider81hd tweeted about having a soft spot for the homeless, Cohen replied, “.@Lowrider81hd So do I and clearly @realDonaldTrump does as well as he has tasked me to find her.

Despite Cohen’s efforts, Scott’s life didn’t seem to turn around. Justin Best, who started a GoFundMe page to help Scott, told Fox News for a Jan. 6, 2017, story that he had trouble helping her overcome homelessness. “I had no idea how difficult this would become,” he told Fox News. “We would find Denise, but then she would disappear again.

 {'title': 'Stormy Daniels: I Want to Depose Trump and Giuliani',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Stormy Daniels is asking a federal judge in California to revive her high-profile lawsuit so she can put President Trump under oath.Last month, Judge S. James Otero put a temporary stop on Daniels’ case against Trump and his embattled attorney, Michael Cohen. Cohen, who vowed to plead the Fifth in the suit, had requested a stay because of the FBI raid on his residence and office, and the federal probe into his business dealings in New York. But in court papers filed Thursday, Daniels is asking Otero to reconsider and modify the 90-day stay. The porn actress says her case against Trump can go on without Cohen, as “new facts” have come to light following the court’s order. Those revelations arise from Trump’s comments in a bizarre, long-winded interview on Fox & Friends and his attorney Rudy Giuliani’s statements to Sean Hannity. Now Daniels wants to depose both Trump and his mouthpiece.“There’s no limitation as to who we’re going to seek discovery from with the only exception being that we’re not going to seek to depose Cohen during the stay period,” Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, told The Daily Beast.“We would likely depose Giuliani, we would likely depose Trump,” Avenatti continued. “We have a whole host of people we want to depose.” Other potential witnesses could include Cohen’s wife, his personal assistant, and individuals associated with First Republic Bank, which Cohen used to pay Daniels.“Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump have once again shot themselves in the foot by making these public statements,” Avenatti added.Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, filed a lawsuit to invalidate the “hush agreement” she inked with Cohen and Trump weeks before the 2016 election. Cohen, through his company Essential Consultants LLC, paid Daniels $130,000 in return for her silence on her alleged romp with Trump at a Lake Tahoe golf tournament in 2006. Daniels says her nondisclosure agreement is void, in part, because Trump never signed the dotted line.Trump, who denied an affair with Daniels, had also claimed he didn’t know about Cohen’s payout to the actress. Weeks later, however, the reality TV star-turned-president spoke up about the Daniels deal in an April 26 Fox & Friends phone rant.Asked about Cohen’s criminal probe, Trump said, “They’re looking [in]to something having to do with his business,” rather than his role in paying Daniels. Trump said Cohen was pleading the Fifth because “he’s got other things—he’s got businesses,” and that campaign money wasn’t used for Daniels’ hush money. Meanwhile, on May 2, Giuliani went on Fox News’ Hannity to say the Daniels payoff was “perfectly legal” and “not campaign money.”“That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know. It’s not campaign money. No campaign finance violation,” Giuliani told host Sean Hannity, who was also revealed to be a client of Cohen’s.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.When Hannity asked if Cohen’s payment to the porn star was funneled through a law firm, Giuliani replied, “Funneled it through the law firm, and the president repaid it.” Trump knew “about the general arrangement” Cohen made with Daniels but “didn’t know about the specifics of it,” Giuliani added.“That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do out of his law firm funds or whatever funds, it doesn’t matter,” Giuliani told Hannity. “The president reimbursed that over the period of several months.”In court papers, Team Stormy says these statements “cast doubt on whether Mr. Cohen’s Fifth Amendment rights are truly implicated by continuing with this proceeding.”“Among other things, Mr. Trump—along with his authorized agent Mr. Giuliani—for the first time have confirmed Mr. Trump’s personal involvement in the facts that gave rise to this lawsuit, including in the payment and the reasons the agreement were entered into,” Avenatti states in his motion filed Thursday.“They both assert that no crime was committed,” the filing alleges. “And Mr. Trump states, with great certainty, that Mr. Cohen is being is being investigated ‘for something having to do with his business,’ not with any matters at issue in this lawsuit.”Trump can defend the case without Cohen’s testimony, Avenatti argued in court papers. “Mr. Trump’s newfound voice on facts concerning this lawsuit demonstrates he will be able to testify in his defense,” the filing continues. “He will also have Mr. Giuliani available to testify for him in this case.”A hearing on Daniels’ request is scheduled for June 21 in Los Angeles.

 {'title': 'Why, Yes. It’s Time to Give Trump Some Credit on Russia*',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It’s time we give Donald Trump some credit on Russia. Yes, we are 15 months in to his presidency. And yes, his record is still overshadowed by his obsequiousness to Vladimir Putin. But after Syria’s chemical weapons attack on civilians, Trump blamed the Russian leader by name (as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad) for the “mindless” attack on many, including “women and children,” and he threatened a “big price.”\xa0Coming on the heels of new U.S. sanctions on Russian oligarchs, officials, and state-owned businesses, this is a significant change. And it strikes me that there are two things worth noting here. First, although it’s impossible to know what might ultimately come out of the Mueller probe, Trump’s recent words and deeds could serve to quiet speculation about kompromat. As Commentary magazine’s John Podhoretz (no Trump booster) observed, “If the Russians have blackmail material on Trump that could destroy him, they should probably let it out pretty soon before his sanctions turn on everybody in Putin’s orbit.” Second, is the fact that sometimes it is worth giving credit when credit is due. Now, in fairness, even for a conservative (especially for a conservative?), praising Trump is almost always something you live to regret. There is always a question of “when will the other shoe drop?” The president has hinted that he’s going to get tough on Russia before, only to revert back to his deferential form. Likewise, there a tax reform bill, followed by a ridiculous spending bill—and the decimation of onerous federal regulations, followed by the impending implementation of new tariffs.\xa0You get the point. Still, I may be in the minority on this one, but my position on politicians is similar to my position on prisoners: Rehabilitation is better than revenge. Not all of my friends and colleagues see it this way. Many #NeverTrumpers wouldn’t compliment Trump for saving a kitten from a tree. Likewise, many in the media have preconceived notions about Trump that cloud their coverage and result in a sort of “damned if he does, damned if he doesn’t” style of journalism. Case in point: Trump finally imposed sweeping new sanctions on Russian oligarchs, and NBC News informs us that, “Sanctions for Russian oligarchs [are] unlikely to seriously impact Putin, experts say.” If Trump is for it, after all, it must be bad, right?Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.To be sure, if Trump wants to prove that his newfound tough talk on Putin is not just a one-off in a knee-jerk response to a Fox & Friends segment, he must answer some important question soon, including: How will he protect the midterm elections from Russian interference? What should the extent of his involvement be in Syria? Should he take steps to dissolve the brutal Putin-backed dictatorship? And does the recent chemical warfare attack mean Trump should renounce talk of leaving Syria altogether? Whether Trump’s actions can mirror his new rhetoric is another case entirely. Regardless, political observers should be willing to dole out praise for good behavior, just as we dispense heaping doses of criticism for scandals. And we should be able to recognize those instances in which our preconceived notions may have been offbase—that Trump’s showdown with Mexico may, in fact, result in a new NAFTA deal; that his brinkmanship with China could, in fact, compel that country to actually lower tariffs. We are not infallible. And we should be honest and consistent in our analysis. This is true because the public deserves to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly, but also because the politicians are more likely to behave properly if they believe that there is some correlation between the coverage and comportment. Now, I suffer no illusions that Donald Trump hangs on my every word or even cares what I think of him. But I do know that, in psychology, there’s something called the “pleasure principle,” which essentially says that we all want to seek pleasure and avoid pain. (The pleasure principle is the guiding force of the id, and Trump is most certainly the living embodiment of the id.)Donald Trump is finally showing some moral leadership in the struggle against Russia. It has been a long time coming, but even baby steps must be applauded if we expect our baby to grow up one day. If you want to win converts, then converts should be welcomed—not crucified."},
 {'title': 'To ‘Cash In’ on Trump’s Presidency, Michael Cohen Sold Clients on Secrecy and Access',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In the winter of 2017, the pharmaceutical giant Novartis made a strategic investment. It paid Donald Trump’s longtime employee Michael Cohen a rate of $100,000-a-month over the course of a year to, in its words, “advise the company as to how the Trump administration might approach certain U.S. healthcare policy matters, including the Affordable Care Act.” But for Novartis and other companies that enlisted Cohen’s services, Cohen’s LLC, Essential Consultants, also provided another benefit: total opacity and anonymity. Through the LLC, the pharmaceutical company could try to shape, or at least predict, federal policy without ever having to disclose the work or the sums paid to carry it out. “Fortune 500 companies are risk averse,” said a top GOP lobbyist. “This structure helped them hide the risk.”Novartis now claims that the arrangement was a bust as it quickly became apparent that Essential Consultants, in the company’s words, “would be unable to provide the services that Novartis had anticipated related to US healthcare policy matters.”Nevertheless, the arrangement, now that it’s been made public, is yet another quagmire for Cohen, who already finds himself dealing with probes into the Trump campaign’s potential collusion with Russia and the payoffs made from the same LLC to a porn star alleging an affair with the president. The opacity of the arrangement is the heart of the issue. Ethicists say that the advocacy practiced by President Trump’s longtime right-hand man and fixer speaks to a phenomenon that good government groups call “shadow lobbying.” It’s the practice of influencing policy and policymakers through activity informal enough to fall short of the legal definition of “lobbying.” An army of consultants, government relations executives, and “political intelligence” professionals earn tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of dollars each year through such soft advocacy, and none of its activities are disclosed to the public.“If it is accurate that Cohen touted his sway over Trump and offered to influence the Trump administration on matters that affect the business interests of Novartis, and these companies in turn made payments to Cohen for such services, that crosses the line into lobbying,” said Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for the group Public Citizen. “Since Cohen is not a registered lobbyist and has not disclosed the payment-for-services, he would likely be in violation of LDA if the payments came from domestic sources, or in violation of FARA if the payments came from foreign sources.”For months into the Trump era, Cohen had talked with friends and associates about his plans and opportunities to “cash in,” as one Trumpworld associate described, on his intimate connections to, and knowledge of, the now most powerful person in the world—his former Trump Organization boss. It was long an open secret in pro-Trump political circles that Cohen was one of many Trump-aligned figures who was knee-deep in courting wealthy people based on his reputation and his purported access to the president.He never registered as a federal lobbyist. He made more than they did. During all of 2017, Novartis’ formal payments to outside lobbying firms averaged under $12,000 a month—less than an eighth of what it paid Cohen for the better part of a year in which, the company says, he did exactly zero work.Another Cohen client, AT&T, reportedly paid Essential Consulting LLC up to $600,000 for “actual work done” according to CNBC. That arrangement, too, was hidden from public view. AT&T did pick up one lobbying firm in early 2017 with some Trump administration pull—Sextons Creek, a firm run by Vice President Mike Pence’s former chief of staff—but reported paying that firm just a fifth of what it paid Cohen.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Cohen did not return a request for comment. But how he managed to score big, despite lacking any tangible D.C. experience or notable policy acumen, is perhaps the clearest illustration of the koan that chaos is a ladder. In the weeks after Trump’s surprise victory in the 2016 campaign, there was a corporate rush to get in the good graces of a president who few had expected to prevail.“Everybody was scrambling,” said the GOP lobbyist. “It was, ‘we need some sort of insider who knows the operation.’ It was a black box.”Cohen was one of the main insiders, having worked for Trump for years prior to his presidential bid. But he was far from the only one benefiting from his connections to the president. Numerous Trump associates and former campaign hands remarked on how their respective stock significantly rose after the 2016 election. “It was a gold rush,” said one former senior Trump campaign official. Some said that if you were on cable news routinely during the 2016 race speaking on behalf of the (then future) president, various entities would aggressively reach out after Trump’s election to solicit insight into his thinking and agenda. A few firms with actual ties to the administration stood to benefit tremendously. Sextons Creek was one of them. Others included Avenue Strategies, Ballard Partners, American Continental Group, Jamestown Associates, and Nahigian Strategies, all of which had senior executives with ties to the Trump campaign or to Trump transition veterans.But while business has, indeed, been good for those firms, none of them scored lobbying contracts with the corporations that turned to Cohen.“We have never talked to either one of those companies,” said Keith Nahigian, whose brother Ken was the lead on the presidential transition team.And Jamestown, which doesn’t lobby, also said that it had “never been contacted by any of these companies,” according to Barney Keller, a partner with the company. Indeed, when Novartis went looking for formal lobbying help, it chose more traditional shops. During the first quarter of 2017, when it began paying Cohen’s LLC, it hired three new lobbying firms, including powerhouses Capitol Counsel and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. During that same period, it also spent about $4.15 million on in-house and contracted federal lobbyists to work on issues similar to those for which it ostensibly brought on Cohen: general health policy concerns, and in particular Trump administration efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act. As for AT&T, which has eyed a controversial merger with Time Warner, Sextons Creek has been retained but has never actually done any lobbying. Cohen, likewise, appears not to have been retained for actual advocacy but for access. According to CNN, his pitch to investors boiled down to: “I don’t know who’s been representing you, but you should fire them all. I’m the guy you should hire. I’m closest to the president. I’m his personal lawyer.”It may be the type of setup that gets Trump’s longtime aide off the hook, legally, in so far as Cohen can plausibly claim that he never functioned as a lobbyist per se. But it’s not a good look either way.As Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, quipped, “It’s almost as if our political system is structured so that economic power can be quietly converted into political influence.”Correction: An earlier version of this piece referred to AT&T's merger with T-Mobile. It has been updated to reflect that the merger opportunity is with Time Warner. "},
 {'title': 'Bernie’s Campaign Manager: Clinton Camp Was ‘Exasperated’ With Wasserman Schultz',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The frustrations Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 2016 presidential campaign had with the tenure of former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) are well documented. But in a new book written by the man who ran the insurgent senator’s 2016 run, it is revealed that Hillary Clinton’s team shared many of those frustrations, especially as the 2016 primary was drawing to a close. In his book, How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That’s Taking Back Our Country—and Where We Go from Here, Jeff Weaver details a meeting the Sanders and Clinton teams held prior to the Democratic convention, in which aides to the former secretary of state detailed how “exasperated” they were with Wasserman Schultz. “I knew that there was no love between the Clinton campaign and the chairwoman. Nor was there any in the White House. Or among large numbers of the DNC’s top leaders. When Bernie was on his way to meet President Obama on June 9, Senator Reid had made a point of calling Bernie during the car ride to remind him to ask the president to dump Wasserman Schultz,” Weaver writes, referencing a meeting Sanders had at the White House in the summer of 2016. “Every time I had raised the issue of Wasserman Schultz with the Clinton campaign, they had blamed her continued tenure on the White House,” Weaver continues. “Whenever I raised the issue with the president’s people, they blamed the Clinton campaign. From my calls with them, I knew that the Clinton people were exasperated with Wasserman Schultz. But I could never tell whether it was because she had put her fingers on the scale in such an incompetent way. Regardless, it just always seemed the case that no one wanted to expend the political capital necessary to push her out, especially as her term would be ending soon anyway.”Weaver’s recollections stand in contrast to the conventional wisdom of many Sanders’ supporters: that Wasserman Schultz’s presence at the DNC thrilled the Clinton campaign because she was, during the course of the primary, putting her thumb on the scales for Clinton. Weaver recounts that during a meeting between the two camps, Clinton ultimately elected not to force Wasserman Schultz’s exit but not out of a feeling of gratitude or patronage.“At our meeting at the Hilton, Hillary Clinton balked at forcing her out,” Weaver writes. “My suspicion was that the Clinton campaign did not want to do anything that would impugn the legitimacy of her victory. Forcing out Debbie Wasserman Schultz would be an acknowledgment that the DNC chairwoman had stacked the deck in Clinton’s favor. That was not our point, however. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, as chair of the Democratic Party during a vigorously contested primary, was supposed to be neutral. She clearly was not. This action item would resolve itself at the Democratic National Convention, when the chairwoman was pushed out after DNC emails were released proving how the organization had worked against our campaign.”A request for comment was not returned from either Clinton’s campaign representatives or Wasserman Schultz’s office.Weaver’s book is, fundamentally, an account of a journey on an underdog campaign and the triumphs and mistakes therein. But his time with Sanders saw him move from managing a long-shot presidential bid to one of the most successful grassroots movements in political history. In the text, he relitigates a lot of the hot-button issues of the primary season and the ups and downs of Sanders’ candidacy. Yet in some instances, even as the two candidates butted heads on policy, Weaver writes that Sanders always respected Clinton and “often expressed the fact that he personally liked her.” “I can’t say that was the most popular applause line with his supporters, but it did reflect his true feelings,” Weaver adds. The book is not entirely outward looking. Weaver also reflects on the framing of Sanders’ campaign and says that he and others may not have done a good enough job trying to position the Senator as the continuation of President Franklin Roosevelt’s legacy. “Bernie as inheritor of the legacy of FDR is a topic that we revisited—most explicitly during the New York primary with our ad “Sons of New York,” which drew the connection between the two,” Weaver writes. “But it was a connection that we might have stressed more thematically throughout the campaign. Bernie Sanders represented a rediscovery of the values of the Democratic Party’s modern roots and an articulation of the unfinished business of the New Deal. By contrast, the neoliberals are a recent aberration.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

That has been debated quite a bit. But what was not sufficiently articulated by us was that in many ways Bernie was running for FDR’s fifth term.”As to whether Weaver thinks Sanders should give it another shot next time, he ends the book with “Run, Bernie, Run!” "},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify in front of three congressional committees and, despite a last-ditch media charm offensive, \xa0it’s shaping up to be a good old-fashioned, bipartisan grilling. The fun starts for Zuckerberg tomorrow at the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees Tuesday afternoon and continues on Wednesday at the House Energy and Commerce Committee.This comes after last week’s Facebook media-blitz –where Zuckerberg interviewed with Vox , held a conference call Q-and-A with reporters, and COO Sheryl Sandberg sat down to TV interviews.Zuckerberg spent part of Monday on Capitol Hill speaking to individual members of Congress–including Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley.Judging by his prepared testimony and congressmen who have already spoken about the upcoming hearings, it looks like Zuckerberg will be grilled on a number of topics–ranging from user data privacy to Russian interference.Zuckerberg’s testimony in particular outlined the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the social network’s role in disseminating content from Russian-based organizations. It was revealed by whistleblower Christopher Wylie earlier this year that Cambridge Analytica had been misusing the personal data of 50 million Facebook users to conduct political ad targeting work. That number was later increased to 87 million after Facebook conducted further analysis. A 2011 Federal Trade Commission settlement may also come into play tomorrow, as the FTC alleged that Facebook violated the privacy terms with its users–including how much personal data third-party apps on the site could access.“It’s really a kind of high noon for Mark Zuckerberg,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who will sitting at the Zuckerberg hearing, told the Wall Street Journal. “He has to have a better answer than just, ‘I made a mistake.’ He didn’t just spill milk on the breakfast table. There is a more fundamental issue related to Facebook’s business model—they sell your information without your consent. That’s what has to change,”The testimony also touched Russia-linked groups APT28 and Internet Research Agency’s use of the social platform. Executives from Facebook already testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee last year on Russian disinformation, but the issue is likely to be rehashed due to Zuckerberg owning up to not taking a “broad enough view of our responsibility.”“It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here,” he wrote.Political bias on Facebook may also get some air time tomorrow, as former employees alleged in 2016 that the platform suppressed content with a conservative political lean. Facebook’s research on the political implications within their feed were reinforced in 2015, when the company found that the news stories people see “are in fact skewed toward their ideological preferences.”Sen. Ted Cruz said he was “very concerned” about a potential anti-right bias on the platform. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) echoed Cruz’s sentiments, saying, "Our promised digital utopia turned out not to be all the land of milk and honey.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Scandal-Battered Scott Pruitt, Hanging on, Hopes John Kelly Overplayed His Hand With Decider Donald Trump',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Senior officials in the Trump White House had urged Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt not to embark on a media blitz this week amid a torrent of scandal threatening his job. But Pruitt did it anyway, because, as a source close to the administrator said, he was convinced no one else from the administration would go out and defend him otherwise. He wasn’t wrong. “There is no warmth coming from us [right now],” is how one senior Trump aide put it to The Daily Beast. But it was still a gamble. The result of Pruitt’s media tour was, among other things, a prickly interview with Fox News that immediately angered top White House staffers. Inside the EPA, however, aides and Pruitt loyalists believe the round of unsanctioned interviews was worth those costs. As of Friday afternoon, influential conservative media figures and lawmakers had rallied to Pruitt’s defense, and President Donald J. Trump had not been convinced by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to sack his EPA chief.Everyone involved in the rolling saga surrounding Pruitt cautions that things could quickly change, depending on the president’s passing whims. But as of Friday afternoon, there was a growing sense of hope among Pruitt allies that he could, indeed would, weather the storm.“It’s not over, nor are we in the clear,” said one source. “But there is a sense of optimism.”Should Pruitt survive, it would constitute a remarkable bit of political perseverance. No other Cabinet official in this administration has endured a series of scandals such as the EPA chief has this week. Revelations that he was renting a below-market-price condo from a well-connected lobbyists led to revelations that said lobbyist had business before the EPA (even though Pruitt had denied this was the case), which were followed by revelations that Pruitt had gone around the White House to get raises for two close aides, which were coupled by revelations that he lied about not knowing about those raises, which were drowned out by revelations that he’d reassigned staff who objected to his high-spending ways, which were coupled by revelations that he’d tried to turn the siren on his motorcade to make it more quickly to a pricey french bistro, which culminated in revelations that he had actually been delinquent on the incredibly cheap rent that he was being asked to pay at his lobbyist-owned pad. Inside the EPA, the cascading news has prompted a frantic search to suss out the sources of these stories—or, at least, to point fingers and start “witch hunts,” as one administration official derisively characterized that search.Three sources with knowledge of the situation have alleged internally that Kevin Chmielewski, Pruitt’s former deputy chief of staff for operations, is behind the flood of damning press leaks. Chmielewski, who is one of the staffers Pruitt reassigned, is close to some prominent Trumpworld figures, including Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, whose book describes the former EPA official as one of the few members of “Corey’s original team who had any political experience.”Current EPA officials, however, have not been able to produce any conclusive evidence that Chmielewski was behind anything, and he has categorically denied the charge.Other targets of the frenzied, informal leak investigation include none other than Rob Porter, the disgraced former Trump aide and accused wife-abuser. On Thursday, the subscription-only publication Inside EPA posted a thinly sourced story reading, “Porter, a top former aide to President Donald Trump who was fired earlier this year over domestic abuse allegations, is reportedly a source of information about EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's ethical transgressions that are threatening his future at the agency, after Porter’s relationship with a top former Pruitt aide soured.”Sources confirmed that this has been whispered about within the Trump administration but, again, none could produce any concrete proof. A source close to Porter told The Daily Beast that the “story is absolutely not true.”As agency leadership tried to pinpoint the sources of discord coming from within, they also have been battling a different source from outside the building. Senior officials familiar with the current situation say that the relationship between the EPA and the White House has deteriorated dramatically as Pruitt’s scandals have worsened. Communications between the two entities have been patchy. And Kelly’s push to have Pruitt fired has turned an already tenuous situation into an outright chilly one.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Rand Paul and Gov. Pete Ricketts (NE)—have rallied to Pruitt’s defense. There is also a feeling that Kelly may have misplayed his hand by letting it be known that he wanted the EPA administrator gone. Should Trump not follow through, after all, it would underscore the chief of staff s diminished clout inside 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., both EPA and West Wing officials believe.“The EPA administrator’s success at aggressively implementing the president’s agenda and rolling back regulations has definitely provided him a grace period—but these stories need to stop, so he can continue to do the job he’s doing,” Marc Lotter, a top Trump media surrogate and Vice President Mike Pence’s former press secretary, told The Daily Beast on Friday afternoon. “It’s unfortunate that these stories are taking away from the success that he’s generating at the EPA.” —with additional reporting by Lachlan Markay"},
 {'title': 'Rick Santorum to Student Activists: Don’t March, Learn CPR',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The day after hundreds of thousands of students and their supporters marched across the country and the world to advocate action on gun violence, Rick Santorum told CNN that they might as well give up now.“How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem, do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that when there is a violent shooter that you can actually respond to that?” the former Republican senator suggested on State of the Union. He went on to dismiss the “action” taken by the student activists who survived a mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month as little more than asking someone else to pass a law. “They didn’t take action to say, ‘How do I, as an individual, deal with this problem? How am I going to do something about stopping bullying within my own community? What am I going to do to actually help respond to a shooter?’” Santorum said. “Those are the kind of things where you can take it internally, and say, ‘Here’s how I’m going to deal with this. Here’s how I’m going to help the situation,’ instead of going and protesting and saying, ‘Oh, someone else needs to pass a law to protect me.’”But as CNN’s Van Jones pointed out, it is ultimately up to lawmakers, not students, to pass laws to protect them. Speaking of his own teenage son, he said, “If his main way to survive high school is learning CPR so when his friends get shot—that to me, we’ve gone too far. I’m proud of these kids. I know you're proud of these kids too.”Santorum responded by saying he is “proud” of the students, but in the next breath criticized them for believing “some phony gun law” is going to prevent the next school shooting. “Phony gun laws don’t solve these problems,” he said. More than using the march to try to convince lawmakers to change their views, the student activists have said the main goal is to encourage voters to show up at the polls for the midterm elections this fall. As one Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student told The New York Times this week, if politicians in Congress do not act on guns following the march,“I’m going to vote them out of office. And so is my entire generation. And they’ll be sorry then.”"},
 {'title': 'Fox News Viewers Overwhelmingly Skeptical of Mueller Probe: Poll',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'For months, the early morning and evening programming at Fox News has been a steady stream of hyper-negative commentary on special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into the possibility that Russian actors colluded with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.It’s proved highly persuasive.According to a new public-opinion survey by the progressive messaging group Navigator Research, self-identified Fox News watchers overwhelmingly oppose the Mueller investigation by a 73-23 percent margin. The breakdown was not included in the group’s formal survey but was part of crosstab tabulations provided to The Daily Beast. And it underscores the immense power of media echo chambers in today’s increasingly tribal politics.The survey found almost the near inverse when surveying self-identified viewers of CNN and MSNBC, who, combined, said they supported the Mueller probe by a 79-18 percent margin (officials couldn’t break the numbers down by specific network viewership without getting into a statistically insignificant sample size). But the two camps were different in one key respect: Fox viewers were on an a proverbial island while CNN and MSNBC viewers were not. When surveying consumers of all other kinds of news except Fox—broadcast tv, cable, print, radio and online—Navigator Research found support for the probe at a 64-25 percent margin. As a right-leaning outlet, Fox News has—among cable channels—been zealous in its cynicism of the special counsel’s efforts, with primetime hosts often portraying the investigation of Trump as an sinister, perhaps lawless, effort to undermine his presidency. There are notable exceptions (see: Smith, Shep). But there is a reason that the network is the primary place for the president and his aides to grant interviews when talking about Russia and other matters. To a certain degree, correlation can be confused with causation in these numbers. The survey found that self-described Republicans generally oppose the investigation by a 74-19 percent margin. The survey also found that 42 percent of Republicans were likely to list Fox News as their primary source of news (a percentage higher than for any other outlet). In other words: partisan predisposition may matter more than what cable-news programming when determining if one supports the Mueller probe. But there are also elements of data that suggest Fox News’ programming has had an impact on its viewers. For example, among those 19 percent of self-identified Republicans who support the Mueller probe, just 10 percent listed Fox News as a primary news source. Among the 74 percent who opposed the probe, 50 percent listed the cable channel as a primary news source.So while there is a clear partisan breakdown of opinion with respect to Mueller, within that partisan split, other factors may very well be at play—one of which is media consumption habits. Overall, Navigator Research found that voters want the Mueller probe to continue by a 20-point margin: 55-35 percent.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'One may be forgiven for thinking that Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron are in love. Their remarkable body language—the air kisses, the back pats, the hand-holding, the dandruff brushing—has been the talk of the town on Macron’s state visit to Washington. But after listening to the French president’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, a question arises that could have enormous geopolitical consequences. What happens if the love of the mercurial American president turns to hate? Does Trump understand how often Macron dissed his isolationism and exaltation of ignorance before the largely enraptured American legislators? (There were so many standing ovations it started to look like calisthenics.) Does Trump, who is always jealous of attention, and who demands unquestioning loyalty from the people around him, not see how powerfully opposed to his policies on trade, on the Iran nuclear deal, on climate change Macron really is?Macron’s de rigueur opening joke was about Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin embracing and kissing, which “can remind you of something.” He then went into a long panegyric about the shared history of France and the United States during the American Revolution, World War I and World War II, talking about “the continuity of our shared history in a troubled world.” (Forgotten, it seems, are the “freedom fries” and the snarky American denunciations of “cheese eating surrender monkeys” when the French dared to oppose the U.S. invasion of Iraq as an act of monumental stupidity.)Macron’s talk about the democratic values of the West and its commitment to freedom were not boilerplate, but a direct response to the know-nothingism and ultra-nationalism resurgent in the 21st century, 70 years after World War II. “Both in the United States and Europe, we are living in a time of anger and of fear,” he said. And who has profited more from that than Trump?“Closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world,” Macron warned. “We have to keep our eyes wide open to the risks right in front of us.” Among them, “rampaging nationalism.” On climate change, which Trump finds it politically expedient to question, Macron repeated one of his own favorite aphorisms. “We are killing our planet. Let us face it. There is no Planet B.” And then, riffing on Trump’s trademark slogan: “Let us work together to make our planet great again in order to create new jobs and new opportunities.” (That prompted one of many standing ovations.) Macron even held out hope that the United States—he didn’t say Trump—might rejoin the climate accord.On Iran and Syria, Macron repeated the same points he had made at a press conference Tuesday: Keep the Iran nuclear deal, and then cut new deals on missiles and on what happens when the original deal expires, while using military force to block the Iranian boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria—which the U.S. must not leave before “as soon as possible” is possible.If Macron were telling Trump something significantly different in private than in public, that might explain Trump’s more than affectionate tolerance. But Macron is a fan of the French Nobel Prize laureate André Gide (a close friend of Oscar Wilde) who penned the famous aphorism: “It is better to be hated for who you are than loved for who you are not.” And of the many criticisms that might be leveled against the imperius French head of state, inconsistency should not be one of them.No, the real danger here is that Trump is so taken with Macron’s flattery and pseudo-filial affection that he hears only what he wants to hear. Love is not blind, but it is blinding, and when the moment of revelation comes the consequences can be catastrophic. Let’s hope that is not the case.UPDATE: On Wednesday evening, Macron told a small group of reporters he did not think he had managed to convince Trump to hold on to the Iran deal. Macron said he had tried to play the "honest broker," giving the American president his best evaluation of the situation, but Trump almost always reverts to positions he knows play well with his base. "When a lot of people say Trump isn\'t predictable, I think the opposite," said Macron. "He is very predictable."'},

Throughout Monday there were deliberations about the progressive congressman potentially leaving his seat and pursuing statewide office. “Our pledge of allegiance promises an America with liberty and justice for all—no exceptions,” Ellison said in a statement. “But too often, Minnesota's working families and the most vulnerable among us are taken advantage of or are targets of discrimination. I am running to be the People's Lawyer to hold those in power accountable and to protect and defend all Minnesotans.”He goes on to say that “No one—not even a president—is above the law. From immigration reform to protecting our air and water, it has never been more important to have a leader as Attorney General who can stand up against threats to our neighbors' health or freedoms.”A unique shakeup in Minnesota politics led to this last-minute decision. On Saturday,\xa0Attorney General Lori Swanson did not get the endorsement of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party at its convention. After that, she withdrew and the convention endorsed Matt Pelikan, a Minneapolis attorney and activist. Swanson turned around on Monday and decided to run for governor instead,\xa0with retiring Rep. Rick Nolan\xa0as her running mate.Ellison enters a somewhat crowded race with Pelikan and two other Democrats in the mix. Since 2017, the Minnesota congressman has served as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, where he has been viewed as a key ally of progressives in the party. He was appointed in the role after losing the chairmanship race to President Obama’s former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. “The first decision I made as DNC Chair was to appoint\xa0Keith\xa0Ellison as my deputy,” Perez said in a statement to The Daily Beast on Tuesday.\xa0“Keith\xa0is a born leader, a brilliant organizer, and a fierce fighter for the Democratic values of inclusion and opportunity for all Americans. And as Deputy Chair, he has been an invaluable voice in shaping our party’s future.”The statement continued: “Whether it’s his leadership of our Winning with Partners program or his engagement of grassroots voters across the country, he has helped our party reach new voters and win elections up and down the ballot.\xa0I have come to know\xa0Keith\xa0as someone who is passionate about finding every possible way to help the greatest number of Americans achieve a better quality of life. And I\xa0have witnessed\xa0that passion\xa0in every single decision he has made,\xa0including whether to continue the fight in Congress or to run and serve as Minnesota's chief law enforcement official.\xa0I’m lucky to call\xa0Keith\xa0a friend, and I couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve accomplished together. Thanks to his ideas, his energy, and his steadfast commitment to our shared values,\xa0Keith\xa0has made our party stronger.”The Daily Beast has confirmed that Ellison will remain in his role at the DNC.

 {'title': 'Andrew McCabe Shops a Book as DOJ Refers Him for Criminal Charges',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Despite a looming criminal investigation, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe has been quietly shopping a book.The Daily Beast can confirm that over the past several weeks, McCabe and his reps have been calling and meeting with publishers to discuss printing a book telling his side of the story amid a yearlong dispute with President Trump. The potential deal was first reported by The New York Times.Although the Times reported that McCabe received offers from multiple publishers and had reached an agreement with one, two publishing industry sources told The Daily Beast that the book’s future could potentially be complicated by a possible criminal probe. The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday referred McCabe to U.S. attorneys for possible criminal charges related to an inspector general’s findings that he “repeatedly misled” investigators about an FBI leak about the bureau’s probe of the Clinton Foundation.But if McCabe does proceed with the book, he’ll have plenty of source material to work with. Like his former boss, ousted FBI Director James Comey, McCabe took copious notes of his interactions with Trump, who has publicly accused the ex-deputy of political bias and covering up alleged internal corruption. The agreement would come on the heels of a slew of successful and controversial political books about the 2016 election and its massive repercussions. Comey’s book A Higher Loyalty, Hillary Clinton’s book What Happened, and former DNC chair Donna Brazile’s book Hacks all rocketed up The New York Times’ bestsellers list over the past year.And given their potentially conflicting accounts of McCabe’s conduct, a book by the former FBI deputy could pit his account against those of his former boss Comey.During an interview on CNN on Thursday, Comey said he could become a witness in a criminal case against McCabe. “Given that the IG's report reflects interactions that Andy McCabe had with me and other senior executives, I could well be a witness,” the ex-director said.In a tweet after the interview, Trump seemed to relish a conflict between the two former top officials.“James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe ‘under the bus.’ Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?” he wrote."},
 {'title': 'White House Lawyers Say Trump Wrote Misleading Response to Trump Tower Meeting',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump, according to his own lawyers, helped deceive the public about the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and a Kremlin-linked lawyer. The revelation came in a 20-page memo obtained by the New York Times, which Trump attorneys John Dowd and Jay Sekulow sent to Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Jan. 29, 2018. The memo argues that the special counsel does not have the power to subpoena the president, and that White House officials and document production have already told Mueller and his team everything they could learn from interviewing Trump. The memo lists 16 topics Mueller’s team purportedly wants to discuss with the president, including “[t]he statement of July 8, 2017, concerning Donald Trump, Jr.’s meeting in Trump Tower.”That meeting—first revealed by the Times—generated massive public outcry. The meeting brought Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort together with Natalia Veselnitskaya, an attorney with close Kremlin ties.The Trump campaign officials went into the meeting after being promised that Veselnitskaya and other Russians who attended with her would have damaging information on Hillary Clinton. But instead, Veselnitskaya pushed for the lifting of sanctions on Russian officials. Kushner, according to later Congressional testimony from one of the participants, was outraged that the Russian attendees didn’t bring Clinton dirt. When the news of the meeting was breaking, Trump reportedly participated in drafting a statement saying the purpose of the meeting was to talk about adoptions.“It was a short introductory meeting,” Donald Trump Jr. originally said. “I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.”Trump’s lawyers, in the letter to Mueller’s team, confirmed all that reporting.The letter even says there is documentation of the president’s role in putting together that initial misleading statement. “You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr.,” the lawyers wrote. “The President is not required to answer to the Office of the Special Counsel, or anyone else, for his private affairs with his children,” the lawyers added. “In any event, the President’s son, son-in-law, and White House advisors and staff have made a full disclosure on these events to both your office and the congressional committees.”This is the first public admission by an official spokesperson for the president that he played a role in drafting the misleading statement. Jay Sekulow, one of the attorneys who signed the letter, told The Daily Beast that no one on the president’s legal team played a role in leaking it to the Times.

 {'title': 'Trump’s D.C. Hotel Gave a Sweetheart Rate to a Pro-Immigrant Worker Group',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., commanded more than $40.4 million in revenue in 2017 and it did so with a simple business strategy. To overcome a low occupancy rate, it charged President Donald Trump’s supporters, and organizations hoping to curry favor, one of the highest room rates in the city. One group, however, got a sweetheart deal. And it just so happened to be in Washington D.C. to lobby for a policy benefiting the president’s businesses.The Seasonal Employment Alliance held its H-2B fly-in from February 14–16, 2018 during which members descended on Capitol Hill to push for an increase in the visas that allow businesses to import temporary foreign workers. The H-2B program is popular with landscapers and farmers. It’s also popular among golf course, resort, and hotel operators—like the Trump family—because it allows them to hire foreign workers to perform low-paying seasonal jobs that would often, otherwise, go unfilled. Last year, the Trump administration raised the H-2B visa cap from 66,000-per-year to 81,000. Three days later, the Trump Organization, from which President Trump can still profit, applied for an additional 76 of those visas to use at its properties. According to the Seasonal Employment Alliance’s fly-in Eventbrite page, Trump’s D.C. hotel gave the group a rate of $245-a-night. In conjunction with the fly-in, the Seasonal Employer PAC also held a $250-per-person fundraising dinner with special guest Rep. Tom Cole (R–Okla.) at the Trump Hotel D.C. The PAC paid the Trump Hotel D.C. $15,000 for the event, although the hotel’s name is missing in FEC filings as the line item just shows SEPAC reimbursing the alliance’s director for that expense.The $245-a-night rate offered to SEPAC was an extraordinarily low price for the hotel. The Daily Beast found group rates for 11 other events hosted at the Trump Hotel D.C. The average for those was $394-a-night—61 percent greater than what the alliance paid. After the Seasonal Employment Alliance’s $245-a-night rate, prices ranged from $285 for the Vapor Technology Association’s “Vape and the FDA 2” conference, which Rep. Duncan Hunter crashed, to $584 for the Sovereign Nations Conference, during which Jordan Peterson addressed “the Marxist lie of white privilege.” Good-government ethicists say that the low rate given to a group with legislative interests that overlap the president’s own private business interests raises numerous red flags. "This apparent gratuity to representatives of an organization in Washington lobbying on an issue that directly goes into the president’s pocket raises the legitimate inquiry: Did President Trump have anything to do with this?,” said Norm Eisen, White House ethics czar under President Obama and a senior fellow at Brookings, chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization involved in two emoluments lawsuits against President Trump. “Even if the president wasn’t directly involved, you still have the appearance issue of a presidential business financially supporting a cause on which the president has one set of interests in his personal capacity (a set of financial interests) and a second set of interests in his official capacity. The question of conflict of interest looms over these allegations."When asked why he chose the Trump Hotel D.C, Gray Delany, the executive director of the Seasonal Employment Alliance and organizer of the fly-in, said he used a third-party company to find a location for the fly-in. That company then presented the offers it collected to him. “I was shocked when I saw it,” Delany said of the Trump Hotel D.C.’s rate.“We got a very good, favorable group rate and they do a great job at the hotel,” he added. ”It really didn’t have anything to do with [president] Trump. But also, the added benefit of [the] Trump [hotel] is that you can run into people who do have influence. That’s always a possibility."Delany later said he ran into no such people.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The White House referred questions about any communication between the president and his businesses regarding discounted rates to the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization did not respond to questions about how it determines group rates. Hoteliers consider numerous factors when determining rates and can charge as little as they want to. The Trump Hotel D.C. doesn’t usually charge a little. It charges a lot.In 2017, the Trump Hotel D.C.’s average nightly rate was $652.98, compared to $495 at other D.C. luxury hotels, which “probably makes it the most expensive hotel in the city,” according to the Washington Post. Per STR, a data and analytics specialist, on the nights of the H-2B fly-in, the average rates of 22 D.C. luxury hotels were $281.21 (Feb. 14) and $265.33 (Feb. 15). While the Trump Hotel D.C.’s average rate was 32 percent greater than its competitors’ last year, the Seasonal Employment Alliance was offered a rate 27 percent lower than the average for the nights it was in town. Seasonal workers and H-2B visas are politically tricky issue for Trump. While the president’s company and some of his supporters rely on them, increasing the cap flies in the face of the president’s pledges to crack down on immigrant labor. \xa0Recently, however, Trump has softened his rhetoric on H-2Bs visas. "The unemployment picture is so good, it\'s so strong, that we have to let people come in,” Trump said at an April 2018 rally in Michigan. "They\'re going to be guest workers. They’re going to come in, they’re going to work on your farms. We’re going to have the H-2Bs come in.” He was met with a smattering of applause—until he added, “But then they have to go out.”White House spokesperson Kelly Love referred questions on Trump’s position on H-2B visas to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS declined to comment. '},
 {'title': 'Everyone Is Painting GOP Congressman Dana Rohrabacher as Putin’s Puppet',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Democratic congressional campaigns have largely shied away from using Russia as a campaign issue in 2018. But in one California district, Democrats and Republicans are teaming up in an effort to essentially put Russian President Vladimir Putin on the ballot.The candidates trying to un-seat Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) in the 48th congressional district are running explicitly anti-Putin, anti-Kremlin campaigns. Rohrabacher is among the dozens of GOP incumbents that Democrats are aiming to defeat in what they hope could be a blue wave in November.But Rohrabacher, who has served for 15 terms in Congress, isn’t your average Republican. He has long expressed a fondness for Putin and has routinely defended the Kremlin—and has consistently been re-elected anyway. But at a time when U.S.-Russia relations are hitting a new low, his opponents believe voters will reconsider Rohrabacher’s loyalties.“While every district and elected office is somewhat affected by what’s going on with the Russia situation and the potential collusion or no collusion between Trump and Russia, this district is different because we have a member of Congress who has a long and inglorious history working with and on behalf of better relations for Russia, and at times it’s looked a bit unseemly,” Harley Rouda, a Democratic businessman challenging Rohrabacher, said in an interview.On a national level, Democrats don’t view that as a winning strategy. They plan to instead zero in on issues, mostly economic ones, that affect voters more directly. But Rouda, who has secured the endorsements of lawmakers who represent southern California, is running an unconventional campaign focused almost exclusively on highlighting Rohrabacher’s record on Russia. The campaign put together a digital ad titled, “Represent us, not Russia,” in which Rouda accuses Rohrabacher of “siding with Vladimir Putin over America’s interests.” His campaign also commissioned a poll which showed that Putin has an 87 percent disapproval rating in the district.Rohrabacher also has two Republican challengers, one of whom is employing a similar Russia-focused strategy as Rouda’s campaign. Billing himself as a moderate Republican in the guise of John McCain and John Kasich, Paul Martin has branded his entire campaign as an anti-Kremlin effort. Martin attended PutinCon, an anti-Putin conference, in New York last month, and he plans on hosting a various “Putin events” in Orange County as part of his crusade to tie Rohrabacher to the Russian president. Martin also won the endorsement of Bill Browder, who led congressional efforts on the Magnitsky Act which punishes Russian human-rights violators.“I’m the only candidate in this race making this the single greatest issue. I’m certainly the only Republican in the race even talking about it,” Martin said in an interview. “Generally speaking, they are not concerned [about Russia]. They are concerned with jobs, very high housing costs, and kitchen-table issues. But as they learn about Russia, as they learn about Dana, they are starting to pay great attention.”Although Martin isn’t a Democrat, California’s so-called “jungle” primary on June 5 will push the top two finishers to the general election, regardless of party, leaving him on the same playing field as the eight Democrats vying for that second spot to challenge Rohrabacher. Martin’s goal, he says, is to elevate the Russia issue to the front of voters’ minds—no matter the electoral cost.“I don’t care if it backfires on me. This is an issue of national security and it’s an issue of human rights, and I will not capitulate to politically correct issues or strategies,” Martin said. “The voters here need to know about Russia, about Putin’s new kind of warfare that he’s waging on America and other western countries.”Foreign-policy issues rarely resonate in congressional races, especially in a midterm year. Candidates often focus on economic arguments surrounding taxes, trade policy and jobs. While Democrats don’t plan to use Russia as a wedge issue to defeat Republican incumbents, they’ve brought it to the forefront as part of their efforts to defeat Rohrabacher and, more broadly, to make the 2018 elections a referendum on President Donald Trump. They’re confident that a localized, anti-Putin campaign will work in Orange County.“Because he’s never run in a competitive race, his record has never been actually litigated. He’s been in the news far more over the last 15 months than he has ever been in his entire career,” said a California Democratic strategist who requested anonymity due to involvement in House races. The strategist defended the idea of using Russia in that race, calling it a “useful catalyst” to call attention to a trove of controversial statements and policy positions in Rohrabacher’s past.Rohrabacher is trying to avoid the issue entirely. He told The New York Times last year that his constituents are more concerned with taxes and illegal immigration than with Russia. But that might be impossible for the California Republican, who has been interviewed by congressional investigators as part of the probes into Russian election-meddling and possible collusion with Trump associates.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Rohrabacher met last year with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and sought to brief Trump on his chief conclusion from the meeting: that Russia was not behind the hacked Democratic National Committee emails that WikiLeaks published during the 2016 campaign. That assertion contradicts the findings of the U.S. intelligence community. Last month, Rohrabacher attended a fundraising event on his behalf hosted by Erik Prince, the Blackwater founder who is facing scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller’s team over an alleged attempt to set up a back-channel between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin. A representative for Rohrabacher did not respond to a request for comment about the fundraiser.“The love of Russia by Comrade Rohrabacher is an issue here locally,” Rouda said, not missing an opportunity to tie his opponent to the Russian leader. “But there are other local issues like jobs and infrastructure and homelessness and health care which are all important to the constituents here as well, and we are certainly trying to address all of those issues in a way that Rohrabacher has failed to do for many years.”National Democrats, with the exception of a few, have largely avoided making Russia the focal point of their campaigns to defeat Republican incumbents by tying them to Trump, despite the president’s similar deferential posturing toward Putin. Polling data has shown that Americans will vote in November based on health care, the economy, taxes, and immigration, suggesting that they’ll look to Democratic challengers to propose viable solutions on those issues. But in California’s 48th district, Democrats argue it would be a mistake to not take the bait on Rohrabacher’s Russia record.“In the end, all politics is local. Obviously focusing on jobs and the economy and on issues that are critical to people may be a better strategy anywhere else, but this is a congressman who’s tied to and supportive of the Putin regime in Russia,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist. “It’s definitely going to be a much bigger issue in this district than anywhere else—it may not even be an issue anywhere else. In most other places, it won’t be.”"},

  'body': "House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Wednesday he will not run for reelection again and would leave the leadership job he never wanted in the first place. “You all know that I did not seek this job, I took it reluctantly but I have given this job everything that I have,” he said. “I have no regrets whatsoever for having accepted this responsibility…the job provides incredible opportunities but the truth is, it is easy for it to take over everything in your life.”Ryan will serve out his full term ending in January 2019, but said his reason for leaving the House had to do with his desire to spend more time with his three children, now all teenagers, who have grown up only knowing their father as a legislator. “What I realize is if I'm here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad,” said Ryan, who lost his father as a teen. “I just can't let that happen. So I will be setting new priorities in my life but I will also be leaving incredibly proud of what we've accomplished.”He added he intend to serve on as speaker, which will all but ensure a six-month leadership race among his deputies. It also gives Democrats a shot at picking up his seat in November. Upon Ryan’s announcement, the Cook Political Report moved his Wisconsin district from “Solid Republican” to “Leans Republican.” \xa0Still, the 48-year-old Republican had increasingly struggled to square his brand of conservatism with the brash, mercurial directives that frequently came from the White House.Axios first reported the news of Ryan’s impending retirement on Wednesday morning.His coming departure sends an already spiraling Republican Party into a full-on tailspin ahead of the midterm elections. Ryan for his part said President Trump, the midterms and all the chaos therein played little role in his decision. “If we do our jobs as we are, we are going to be fine as a majority,” Ryan said, almost convincingly. \xa0But in fairness, as he stated several times during his press conference, he never wanted the job. “His coming departure sends an already spiraling Republican Party into a full-on tailspin ahead of the midterm elections.”Ryan was thrust into the top Republican post after then-Speaker John Boehner pulled the ripcord following several years of trying to manage the increasingly unruly and combative GOP conference. \xa0While Ryan’s ascension was largely cheered by the conference, they did not make it an easy ride. Ryan was mired with many of the same issues that plagued Boehner, made worse by an unpredictable frenemy in the White House.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

A spokesman for Ryan said the speaker was “extremely worried” that such tariffs would set off a dangerous trade war and urged the president “to not advance with this plan.”In response, Trump said: “We’re not backing down.”Ryan came to the House nearly 20 ago, a young protege of conservative stalwart Rep. Jack Kemp, who he served as speechwriter early in his career. Ryan long spoke about entitlement reform and aspired to be the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, a post he held for only ten months before until he became speaker in 2015. Still, Ryan said the GOP-led tax overhaul, passed last fall, had fulfilled a lifelong dream.He was known as a policy leader in the House, which spurred former Massachusetts governor and current Senate candidate Mitt Romney to ask him to join the Republican ticket in 2012 as his vice president pick.Ryan, who raised more than $11 million in the first three quarters of the year, was being challenged by far-right Republican Paul Nehlen and Democrats Cathy Myers and Randy Bryce. \xa0\xa0As Republicans in the House were already struggling to maintain a stronghold for the midterms, Ryan’s departure means Democrats could be one step closer to winning a majority. It also could inspire another wave of retirements. At the time of Ryan’s announcement, 41 House Republicans announced they are either retiring or running for another office this year.A little more than an hour after Ryan’s announcement, Florida Republican Dennis Ross announced he too would retire at the end of his term.

 {'title': 'Jeff Sessions Will Lose the GOP’s Battle Over Weed',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In the year-and-a-bit since Donald Trump took office, Americans have witnessed a neck-wrenching 180-degree turn on an array of policy topics. One of the biggest has been with regard to drugs. Between anti-marijuana moves by Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and apparent interest by the administration in making passing a drug test a condition for receiving food stamps in states that request it, Trump and key figures in his administration seem eager to jump back to a time in history when drug use that has become more or less accepted in society is again disqualifying and indeed criminal. And where Trump goes, the GOP often follows.But is the Trump administration truly set on achieving this? Those of us watching drug policy debates in the era of Trump are feeling a little (OK, a lot of) whiplash.The direction in which Sessions wants to take the country is clear. So too are Republicans’ views with regard to food stamps and drug testing.With Trump, things are a bit murkier. He generally cultivated an anti-drug message with his “death penalty for heroin dealers” chat. He’s pushed that message in other ways too, such as the little noticed controversy in February, when Israel put the brakes on a plan to export marijuana to the U.S., apparently because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t want to piss off Trump. Trump also claims never to have smoked pot, something that some pot advocates view as inherently likely to predispose him against cannabis.But during the campaign, Trump was pot-neutral. He exclaimed that he was for letting states decide their own pot and medical marijuana policies. And just weeks ago, he voiced support for Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO)’s bill codifying states’ rights with regard to pot. Reportedly, his campaign manager is making that position a selling point to Colorado voters ahead of 2020.Outside of Trump, the GOP itself seems to be in the midst of an evolution on pot. Or, at least, a process of self-discovery. Gardner was so adamant that states’ rights on the matter be respected that he threatened to hold up any nominees to the Department of Justice until Sessions and Trump backed down. We’ve also learned that John Boehner is joining the board of a cannabis company—a pretty big turnaround for a former speaker of the House known more for his love of wine than weed. So what the heck is going on with the GOP and pot? The short answer is: a lot. But though much of it seems contradictory, there is still an obvious, ultimate direction. The GOP will, in the end, follow Gardner and Boehner’s path, even if that feels like an Olympic gymnast-level flip-flop for a lot of voters.It used to be that the only pro-decriminalization or pro-legalization Republicans were Libertarians who voted GOP because they wanted tax cuts and a tiny bit more fiscal restraint (with the exception, perhaps, of some prominent figures at National Review who always took a surprisingly pro-decriminalization line on marijuana).More recently, however, the pro-decriminalization ranks have been joined by the Koch brothers, especially Charles Koch, who champions criminal justice reform and sees issues like pot decriminalization and mandatory minimums reform as obviously related. There are also Republicans from states where marijuana laws have been liberalized, leading to a booming new sector of the economy. Gardner is one such figure. But more Gardners are on the way. While Sessions may believe the “War on Drugs” has failed because it has been prosecuted with insufficient zeal, you’ve got a whole raft of states represented by Republican officeholders who manifestly believe that the anti-pot aspect of it, at least, is stupid.

Nine states have fully legalized recreational pot (including Alaska, a deep red state, and Colorado, Nevada, and Maine—purplish ones with GOP elected officials). Twenty-nine states have legalized medical marijuana (including the magenta-ish states of North Dakota, Arkansas, Montana, and West Virginia, and swing state New Hampshire).Rank-and-file Republican voters are becoming much more opposed to the War on Weed too, according to an October 2017 Gallup poll. Maybe that’s because veterans (who Republicans love to champion) claim marijuana helps them with physical and psychological battlefield injuries. Maybe it’s because of claims that legalization could help combat the opioid epidemic, which is ravaging Republican areas. Maybe it’s because Republicans are hearing from unlikely marijuana advocates like Michelle Malkin.Or maybe it’s because Republicans still tend to consider themselves “pro-business,” and the pot business is growing—fast. According to a report last year from Arcview Market Research, across North America, legal pot sales in 2017 were on pace to hit $9.7 billion. That’s 33 percent growth against the previous year—evidence of a booming market. Many Republicans may oppose pot use personally. But basically all Republicans love making and keeping money.Whatever it is, the reality is this: The ranks of pro-legalization Republicans, like plants on weed farms, will continue to grow over time, while those sharing Sessions’ views will shrink and shrivel and decline. That’s a good thing, in terms of achieving limited government goals, and expanding personal liberty—something today’s GOP could do with getting back to focusing on.The debate may seem muddied now. But it’s heading in a very clear direction. "},
 {'title': 'Tom Steyer’s Impeachment Campaign Is Building Him a Political Death Star',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Ask a professional Democrat for his or her opinion on billionaire political donor Tom Steyer, and the answer you often get is a variation of the following: Why would someone with so much money spend it all on a fruitless attempt to impeach Donald Trump?Press them for their thoughts in private, however, and many concede that the man funding a $40 million campaign to get rid of the current president is not just a gifted self-promoter, but is, in fact, building one of the true powerhouse entities within the Democratic ecosystem. Steyer is poised to play a massive role in the midterms and pull the party in the direction of his choosing. He’s also set himself up incredibly well—perhaps better than any other potential aspirant—for a serious presidential bid in 2020. “If I were a rich person and I wanted to run for president,” said one top Democratic strategist, “I would be doing exactly what he’s doing.” What Steyer is doing is acquiring the equivalent of prime political real estate. Through his self-funded Need to Impeach campaign, he has now built an email list of more than 5.1 million members, a total that one former presidential campaign manager called “staggering” and a top digital adviser called “one of the biggest Democratic lists out there.” Perhaps even more remarkable is how Steyer came about doing it. Kevin Mack, the lead strategist on the impeachment campaign, said the first million members signed up in just six days. He added that open rates remain high—“probably at least double the industry standard”—allowing them to take two to three campaign actions at a given time. Approximately 1,975,000 of those on the list are identified as infrequent midterm voters. “They care more about digital than the DCCC and the DNC,” said one of the party’s top digital strategists. As formidable as Steyer’s data operation is, there may still be room to grow. The group has only spent one-third of its budget on digital and, according to Mack, its typical email list member is an elderly woman—a reflection of the cable-heavy ad focus but also an indication that a younger, internet savvy demographic is still there for the taking. Even Republicans are impressed. Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former adviser to California Republicans including former Govs. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Pete Wilson, thinks the emerging voter database portends a potential presidential bid.“I look at Tom Steyer and I see what is the equivalent of Cambridge Analytica,” Whalen told reporters at a Hoover conference on Sunday, referring to the Trump-aligned firm at the center of controversy over the use of allegedly pilfered Facebook data. Whalen wasn’t suggesting that Steyer has engaged in similar malfeasance but simply that his data-centric operation is a potent political force.“He is collecting signatures and he is building a potential voter database, which puts him in a rather interesting spot for 2020,” Whalen added. “I don’t know where impeachment goes if the Democrats get the House, but he’s been there from the beginning of that topic.”In an age when the political parties are growing less influential, Steyer has, in essence, built a mini-party of his own. By latching on to the issue of impeachment, he has become both a leading figure in the resistance movement and the standard bearer for how anti-Trump a presidential candidate can and should be. Allies say he’s tapping into the sense among Democrats that their country is being taken away. More neutral observers hear echoes of how birtherism was used against President Obama, albeit absent the racist dog whistles and lack of sophistication.“He is using Trump the way Trump used Obama,” said Tad Devine, a top Democratic operative who helped run Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) presidential campaign. “It as an organizing point. There is so many people who dislike Trump at such a basic level that that is the single most popular issue out there… The guy has an ability to repel voters like nothing else out there, and if you can be associated with taking him on, it is a big deal.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Steyer’s team is hardly coy about his political ambitions. Mack confirmed that Steyer not only eyed a run for California governor and Dianne Feinstein’s Senate seat, but also polled how he would do in those contests. The results aren’t known. But Mack did reveal that among those on the Need to Impeach mail list, Steyer enjoys an 89 percent name recognition and an 86 percent popularity rating. “Tom’s number one priority is winning back the House in 2018. We see that as the first step in the impeachment process,” said Mack. “If that doesn’t occur, I think Tom will look at all his options and make the decision he thinks is best for the country.” What Steyer has in money, issue appeal, and email addresses, however, he lacks in political roots. He cut his teeth at the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, which he founded in 1987 and led until 2012, when his net worth was pegged at $1.3 billion (Forbes now estimates it’s $1.6 billion). It was only in 2014 that he fully thrust himself into federal electoral contests, but he quickly became by far the largest political donor in the nation. Initially, his focus was almost exclusively on climate change. But his ad campaigns had limited success, and Steyer’s preferred candidates lost a majority of the federal elections in which he got involved in the 2014 and 2016 cycles.He didn’t drop the climate focus. He just added impeachment into the mix. At first, it was merely in bringing up the topic during media hits. Elected Democrats begged him to stop. But a source close to Steyer said he was amazed at the feedback he’d get for those hits, which, in turn, convinced him that there was a strong political appetite for the issue. And he didn’t half-ass it. Mark Putnam, widely considered one of the top ad men in Democratic politics, has produced the TV spots, while top party officials such as Bruce Reed (Joe Biden’s former chief of staff) and Chris Lehane (Al Gore’s former press secretary) have previously served as advisers. Steyer’s critics—and he has a few, all of whom would rather not have their thoughts on the record—argue that the campaign is a political vanity project, one that doesn’t poll well among the broader public and could deeply damage the party’s messaging during the midterms. But even they concede that there is a maddening ingeniousness to it.“I think he is someone who thought about running for governor and thought the job was too small,” said one longtime Democratic strategist. “He is like many other people who have significant wealth and are looking at the person in the White House and thinking, ‘Heck, I’d be better than he would.’ I don’t think he’s unique in that. But he has been active longer and doing it more creatively than many of these people.”Even if it is all being done to further the interest of one Steyer, Tom, Democrats elsewhere may stand to benefit too. Money for Need to Impeach comes directly from Steyer, making it difficult to track exactly how much he’s spending on the effort. But his foremost political vehicle, NextGen Climate Action, has raised more than $16 million during the 2018 election cycle. And more than half of those funds have been passed along to other groups or spent on political activity in support of specific candidates. Foremost among the latter was Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, for whom NextGen provided more than $765,000 in in-kind goods and services during his run last year. (It was not lost on Virginia operatives that on the night of Northam’s win, Steyer was doing cable appearances from the victory party.)The group has donated millions more to leading left-wing political organizations, including prominent Democratic groups such as opposition research group American Bridge 21st Century, labor union-backed super PAC for Our Future, and, most recently, a $1.5 million contribution to a new state-level political outfit called State Victory Action.Some of NextGen’s financial and in-kind contributions are of particular note given the states to which they’ve been directed. Virginia Democrats—including Northam, Attorney General Mark Herring, and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax—have been prominent beneficiaries. The group has also donated to Democrat-aligned organizations in Nevada, Ohio, and Florida, all states with competitive 2018 Senate races, and all key presidential swing states. NextGen Rising, the youth turnout entity housed in one of Steyer’s nonprofit groups, has been highly active in 10 states, including the crucial battlegrounds of Florida, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Virginia. Need to Impeach is turning toward campaign organizing as well. Mack said the group conducted voter turnout efforts during the special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th district, where it had 4,800 people on its email list. They plan to distribute tool kits for voter registration and turnout to those members in competitive congressional districts as November nears.Recently, Steyer has begun holding town halls on impeachment—an effort pitched as a way to gin up grassroots support but one seen by operatives as a campaign-training exercise for its benefactor. “It’s like a boxer getting a sparring partner” is how Devine put it. As Steyer’s profile has grown, so too has the wariness among a faction of Democrats. Lawmakers on the Hill who support impeachment say they’re frustrated by how little interest Steyer seems to have in their legislative efforts. “It’s a good message, but if you’re trying to be effective, mention there is a bill and urge representatives to get on that bill,” said one Democratic House member, who nevertheless conceded that Steyer had been helpful in raising the profile of the issue.And party leadership, including House Minority Leader and fellow San Franciscan Nancy Pelosi, have made their discomfort with the topic abundantly clear. Steyer, who didn’t consult Pelosi before launching his Need to Impeach campaign, seems to be taking the criticism in stride, more than content to be at the vanguard of the party’s digital operations and its resistance movement. “Frustrating members of Congress is not really our concern. It’s our job to shine a light on the problem, and their job to fix it,” said Mack. “Tom is giving voice to the American people who want to take action. They have an affinity for him and what he is doing.” "},
 {'title': 'How an Actual GOP Hero Spoke Truth to Power—68 Years Ago',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Politicians have long tried to paint themselves as the modern day incarnation of their party’s former heroes. Everyone fights to be labeled the new Reagan or the next Kennedy, who were themselves the new Lincoln or the next Roosevelt, all of whom were just the latest incarnation of Washington and the founders. It lends credence to the old adage that history never repeats itself, but it does rhyme.But the glorification of partisan forerunners bypasses less known but nonetheless important party scions and dismisses the ignominies of the past. We ignore our history at our peril in today’s political climate, which harbors frighteningly familiar echoes of the past.Sixty-eight years ago today, one of the most influential yet underappreciated speeches of the modern era was delivered on the Senate floor. It came from a voice that was not well known at the time, belonging to a woman who is only occasionally remembered by the Republican party at times of convenience: Senator Margaret Chase Smith. And it came at a time—the beginnings of the Red Scare—when her party was losing its way. Dubbed the “Declaration of Conscience,” Smith’s speech was revelatory.Just a few months prior, in February of 1950, a largely unknown Wisconsin Senator named Joseph McCarthy waved a paper on stage and boldly declared that he held the name of 205 communists who had infiltrated the State Department. The ensuing shock and fright provided McCarthy a meteoric rise to prominence.People caved to McCarthy in fear that he would publicly accuse them of communist sympathies. Even without a shred of evidence, he could ruin careers. He often turned his ire to journalists at his raucous public rallies. He even assaulted a reporter once. He drove his supporters to believe fevered conspiracies about communists in the closet, while silencing the truth through wild, slanderous accusations. He was brutally effective, and many of his Republican colleagues embraced, if reluctantly, his bombast and deceit..Margaret Chase Smith shared McCarthy’s concerns that Communists might infiltrate the government. Yet, after months of asking for proof, she realized that there was none. And unlike many of her GOP colleagues, Senator Smith wasn’t willing to debase herself and the institution she served by engaging in McCarthyism. So on June 1st she took to the floor, standing mere feet from Senator McCarthy, to deliver her Declaration of Conscience. In it, she reiterated her commitment to her party, but also warned them against the destructiveness of their path. “I don’t want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horsemen of calumny—fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear,” Smith declared.Margaret Chase Smith’s words are every bit as relevant today as they were in 1950. GOP leaders have forgotten the lessons of McCarthy’s disgrace, turning once again to the destructive allure of the four horsemen. President Trump tweets daily, leveraging tools of deceit to rally his base and distract from investigations into his campaign and close associates.If we lived in the world painted by the president’s twitter account, it would be a frightening place indeed. We get a look at this potemkin dystopia daily, as his false claims are echoed and amplified by a fear-driven media machine comprised of personalities like Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Dan Bongino, and Alex Jones. It’s a surreal mixture of anti-immigrant scapegoating and impossible conspiracies of shadowy anti-american infiltrators undermining the country from the ranks of our Department of Justice. Like McCarthy, the president and his media backers are waving a blank paper before our noses, declaring he has proof of conspiracy that almost never materializes.But the modern McCarthyism neither begins nor ends with Trump. Among the ranks of Congressional Republicans are a litany of elected representatives clamoring to outdo one another in sycophantic regurgitation of Trump’s deceit. So far, the lead horse is House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Nunes has fully embraced the McCarthy model of fear and slander. From his stunning but false accusation that the FBI wiretapped and unmasked Trump campaign staff, to his memo on supposed FISA abuse which flatly misled about the warrant process, he has repeatedly driven the baseless narrative of a “deep state” working against the president and the country.As in the case of McCarthy, Nunes isn’t acting alone. When Margaret Smith gave her stirring rebuttal to McCarthyism, six other Republicans signed her Declaration of Conscience. Today you would be hard pressed to name six Republicans in all of Congress who would sign such a declaration. The allure of political momentum rooted in fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear again proves too tempting.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Arizona Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake come to mind, speaking out against the assault on democratic norms even as their service comes to an end. Senator Ben Sasse has also stood up at times. Recently, Trey Gowdy has been vocal in debunking the President’s ludicrous claims that the Justice Department ‘spied’ on his campaign. It may be that Gowdy’s willingness to stand up against McCarthy-like attacks on the DoJ is a crack in the GOP’s foundation of calumny.Or it may still be that the current GOP is ill-equipped to provide that commitment to conscience. Either way, the modern incarnation of Margaret Chase Smith might very well be on the horizon. We should look for her spirit this November, and hold both incumbents and challengers to her high standard. \xa0It will be up to us, the citizens, constituents and voters, to make our own Declaration of Conscience, and reject the calumny and conspiracy of the modern McCarthyism.Mindy\xa0Finn is the co-founder of pro-democracy organization Stand Up Republic and the founder of Empowered Women.

  'body': 'Appearing Tuesday morning on the Fox Business Network, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) issued a stern warning to President Trump over his recent tirades against the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.The president has reportedly been fuming over the news that his personal lawyer Michael Cohen’s home and office were raided Monday by the FBI—based on a tip passed along from Mueller’s investigation. Trump described the raid, and the ongoing Mueller probe, as “a disgraceful situation” and “an attack on our country.”“I have confidence in Mueller, the president ought to have confidence in Mueller,” Grassley said Tuesday morning, “and I think it would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller.” Grassley offered some unsolicited advice to Trump on how best to navigate the situation: “The less the president says on this whole thing, the better off he would be, the stronger his presidency would be.”'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Medical professionals on Monday slammed former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) for his claim that school-shooting survivors should just learn CPR instead of protesting for “phony gun laws.” Santorum, who currently serves as a CNN commentator, knocked the youth-led March for Our Lives protest on Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union, a day after 800,000 students and families rallied in the Washington, D.C. demonstration against gun violence. “How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem, do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that when there is a violent shooter that you can actually respond to that,” Santorum said.While Santorum said he is “proud” of the students for voicing their opinions, he also dismissed their efforts. \xa0“They took action to ask someone to pass a law,” the ex-presidential candidate said to CNN. “They didn’t take action to say, ‘How do I, as an individual, deal with this problem? How am I going to do something about stopping bullying within my own community?’”David Hogg, one of the more prominent student activists and survivors of the Parkland, Florida massacre, responded Monday on CNN, telling Santorum: “At the end of the day, if you take a bullet from an AR-15 to the head, no amount of CPR is going to save you, because you’re dead.”Physicians and CPR specialists also trashed the ex-senator’s suggestion.Dr. Joseph Sakran, a six-year trauma surgeon at John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore told The Daily Beast that Santorum’s comments were a “false” representation of CPR’s effectiveness.“CPR saves lives for sure, but just not in this situation,” said Sakran, who was shot in the throat at 17 years old with a .38-caliber bullet. “If someone gets shot in your school and they are bleeding to death, the biggest thing you can do is get them to a trauma center as quickly as possible. So, they can stop the bleeding and resuscitate the patient.”The American Red Cross states that CPR, an acronym for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a life-saving tool during a cardiac or breathing emergency. But medical professionals said that isn’t as useful as in an active-shooter situation, where there are life-threatening bullet wounds.But Anthony Rose, a CPR instructor of more than 18 years in New York, told The Daily Beast that Santorum’s idea would be a “grossly inappropriate” response in an active-shooter situation. \xa0“What you need to do is stop the bleeding and put direct pressure, which slows the blood loss,” Rose said. “Once you die from blood loss, it’s like the soul has left the body, there’s no way to put it back in.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

It buys time,” Caruthers said. “A mass shooter [is] coming down the hallway and you’re going to stop, kneel down next to them, tap and shout to ask them if they’re okay and then spend the next 10 seconds assessing whether or not they’re breathing? All the while the shooter is coming toward you?” In active-shooter situations, specialists say, it’s often too late to rely on CPR for a victim’s recovery. “It’s already happening,” Caruthers said, adding: “Everyone has the responsibility to defend their own lives. You can’t wait for someone else to arrive in 18 minutes to do it for you.” "},
 {'title': 'Trump’s ‘Fine People’ on Trial for Terror',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A major terrorism trial began last week in a Kansas federal court involving religious extremists who wanted to kill hundreds of people on U.S. soil using machine guns and explosives in the hopes of starting, in essence, a holy war. If you are wondering why Donald Trump hasn’t tweeted even once about this, the answer is simple: These accused terrorists are white Christians. Add to that, they are Trump fans.The defendants in this case, Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright, and Curtis Allen, were charged in the fall of 2016 after an eight month FBI investigation with plotting a massive terrorist attack on U.S. soil. These three man called themselves “The Crusaders,” as in Christian crusaders. And just like their namesake, these men were waging a holy war versus Muslims. However, this war wasn’t going take place in the Holy Land, but against Somali Muslim immigrants living in Garden City, Kansas.As federal prosecutor Risa Berkower argued in her opening statement on Thursday, the three “wanted to send the message Muslims are not welcomed here—not in Garden City, not in Kansas, not in America.” And to this end they came up with a bone chilling plan. These three white supremacists plotted with military precision a terrorist attack against the local Muslim American community that would slaughter everyone there, including the children, in the hopes it would “wake people up” and inspire others to take up arms and slaughter Muslims living in our country.The three “brainstormed various methods of attack, including murder, kidnapping, rape, and arson” that was all recorded by an undercover FBI agent. And this was far more than the rantings of anti-Muslim bigots. They engaged in extensive reconnaissance by mapping out with maps and photos the possible places they wanted to attack. “These three men didn’t want to just kill some Muslims, they wanted to ‘exterminate’ them, referring to Muslims as ‘cockroaches.’”Finally they decided on attacking an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, that was populated primarily by Muslim immigrants. One of the apartments served as the community’s mosque.As Stein, the apparent leader, was recorded as saying, “The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim,” adding, “If you’re a Muslim, I’m going to enjoy shooting you in the head.” Stein suggested “kicking in the doors of the Somali apartments, and kill[ing] them one by one.” The three defendants even spoke of raping the Muslim women and killing Muslim children in the apartment complex.Stein was a big Trump fan, publicly praising him while slamming Hillary Clinton on Facebook in the lead up to the 2016 election. In fact, Stein spoke of dipping bullets in pig’s blood before shooting the Muslims. If that sounds familiar that’s because it’s the same story Trump told countless times on the campaign trial when he recounted the debunked tale\xa0of Gen. John Pershing dipping bullets in pigs blood before shooting Islamic terrorists as an effective way to stop “radical Islamic terrorism.”Another defendant, Allen, had planted a “Make America Great Again” sign on his front lawn during the campaign. He had also complained to neighbors about “Crooked Hillary,” demonized Muslims and vented that Somalis where “taking all of our jobs.”These three men didn’t want to just kill some Muslims, they wanted to “exterminate” them, referring to Muslims as “cockroaches.” “If I could get ahold of a warthog [an A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft] or an Apache helicopter, I would be after that, too,” Stein stated per the court records. What the three settled on to carry out their terror plot was 300 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, the same raw material Timothy McVeigh used in 1995 to bomb the federal building in Oklahoma City. They would then fill two cargo vans with this explosive material and park both in the parking lots of the apartment complex, later detonating them to slaughter the Muslim immigrants living there.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But before they could carry out their terrorist plot, they were arrested after one of them delivered the 300 pounds of fertilizer to an undercover FBI agent who the men believed was going to help them transform the substance into a bomb. Trump did not make these men hate Muslims. It’s clear their views on Islam and Muslims pre-date Trump’s campaign. But Trump has emboldened them and others like them with his openly anti-Muslim rhetoric. It was in December 2015 that Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” That’s exactly what these defendants wanted. The difference is the defendants were planning on using violence, not government policy, to send the message that Muslims are not welcomed in the United States.There’s no doubt other Trump supporters share the view that Muslims should be banned from the United States—after all 65 percent of GOP primary voters in 2016 were on board the total Muslim ban. That helps explain why the defendants’ lawyers in this case made a motion to the judge to add more people to the pool of prospective jurors who lived in the more rural western part of the state. While Kansas is a red state, the rural western part is even redder and heavily went for Trump. As the defendants’ lawyer wrote in that motion, this case in their view is “uniquely political” because much of the evidence will relate to the 2016 election. The judge denied their motion. Add to that, the defense lawyers, taking another page from Trump, are attacking the FBI. In this case, the lawyers claim that it was FBI wrongdoing, namely entrapment, that unfairly persuaded the defendants to go along with the terrorist plot.The trial will continue for the next six weeks. If convicted the defendants face life in jail. And if that happens, you can forget Trump slamming these men as terrorists. Based on Trump’s track record, it’s more likely he would praise them as “fine people” before using the word “terrorist” to describe his white supremacist supporters. "},
 {'title': 'Forget Samantha Bee—Donald Trump Has Called Women ‘C*nt’ for 30 Years',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Two days after President Donald Trump tweeted that he would be “focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more,” the White House has aimed the combined efforts of its entire communications staff on getting a comedian fired for calling White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt.”“The language used by Samantha Bee last night is vile and vicious,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. “The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling. Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network.”The White House’s war on the Full Frontal host, however, risks calling more public attention to the president’s own alleged use of the word “cunt” to describe at least three women since the 1980s—including a journalist, a former acting attorney general, and a woman who has accused Trump of groping her aboard an airplane.On Thursday, Bee attacked the president’s eldest daughter and adviser during a monologue responding to Trump’s posting of a picture holding her youngest son. Amid scrutiny of the administration’s policy of separating undocumented children from their parents if families are caught crossing into the United States, Bee accused the post of being “the second most oblivious tweet we’ve seen this week.”“You know, Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another,” Bee said. “Do something about your dad’s immigration practices, you feckless cunt!”The late-night host has since apologized to Trump “for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable.”Trump himself has been accused of leveling the same language at three women over the span of more than three decades, most recently in author Michael Wolff’s blockbuster book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. In Fire and Fury, Trump is reported to have used the oath in reference to former acting attorney general Sally Yates, whom Trump fired after she reached the conclusion that an executive order banning people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States was unconstitutional.Wolff notes that while the president was facing off against the entire Justice Department, “to Trump, he was just up against Sally Yates, who was, he steamed, ‘such a cunt.’”Not all accusations that Trump used the word “cunt” to describe a woman stemmed from questions of constitutional law. In one instance, Trump is alleged to have used the word because he didn’t like the headline of a journalist’s article.After reporter Jennifer Lin, then a financial correspondent for the Philadelphia Inquirer, wrote a story about Trump’s attempts to underbid shareholders for increased control of an Atlantic City casino project in 1988, Lin received a call from a Trump Organization secretary asking her to “hold for Mr. Trump.”“There was no hello. But there was yelling, lots of yelling,” Lin wrote of the exchange in 2016, five weeks before the presidential election. “The word ‘shit’ was used repeatedly as a noun and adjective. I had shit for brains. I worked for a shitty newspaper. What sort of shit did I write.”Before she could reply, Lin wrote, Trump hung up on her—and then called her editor, who “was treated to the same Trumpian wordplay, but got an added treat.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Trump referred to me as ‘that cunt,’” Lin wrote, a word she would later tell CNN was, “in my opinion… the worst word in the English language to refer to a woman.”When pressed by her editor, Lin recounted, Trump couldn’t name any particular inaccuracy in her piece—in part because Trump hadn’t actually read it.“No one reads the story,” Trump allegedly told Lin’s editor. “I read the headline and I didn’t like it.”Another woman has alleged that Trump called her a “cunt” simply because she resisted his sexual advances aboard an airplane.Jessica Leeds, now 76, was one of the first women to publicly accuse Trump of sexually aggressive behavior during the presidential campaign. Five days after The Washington Post released video showing Trump boasting about his fame allowing him to grope women without their consent, The New York Times published Leeds’ accusation that Trump had groped her breasts and attempted to reach up her skirt while they sat next to each other onboard a plane in the early 1980s.“He was like an octopus—his hands were everywhere,” Leeds said at the time. “It was an assault.”In December of last year, Leeds told NBC’s Megyn Kelly Today that three years after the incident, she ran into Trump again at a charity gala in New York City.“I knew, and I recognized him, immediately—he’s the guy on the airplane,” Leeds said. “But he stands there, as I’m handing him this table assignment, and he says, ‘I remember you. You were that…” Leeds paused, indicating a missing word, “...woman from the airplane. He called me the worst name ever.”Asked by Kelly to give the audience a hint, Leeds confirmed that the word began with a “c” and ended with a “t”: “It’s the worst one, it really is.”“It was shocking,” Leeds said. “It was like a bucket of cold water being thrown over me.”The White House did not return requests for comment about Trump’s alleged use of the word “cunt” to describe Yates, Lin, or Leeds. Trump has, however, suggested that Leeds was too ugly for him to be credibly accused of sexually assaulting her.“Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you,” Trump said in October 2016. “That would not be my first choice—look at her.”"},
 {'title': 'Nancy Pelosi’s Last Stand',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Nancy Pelosi has never lost the vote in a leadership fight, or on the floor of the House, and she intends to reclaim the speaker’s gavel should the Democrats win back the House. Had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, Pelosi planned to give up her San Francisco seat and move on, confident the Republic was in safe hands. Instead, she stayed to fight the good fight, and her future will be determined by what happens in November. If the Democrats fail to regain the House majority after a year of anticipation, those dashed hopes would surely end Pelosi’s storied career.But with most forecasters predicting a Democratic win in the House, the leadership picture gets complicated. Will Pelosi dig in her high heels for another tour of duty as speaker, and will newly empowered Democrats drawn from the Resistance remain loyal to a leader that some of them ran on opposing?“No one thinks Nancy is about to give up without a fight,” says David Wasserman, who tracks House races for the non-partisan Cook Political Report. “The question is whether there are enough Democrats to get her to 218. If they take back the House by 5, I can name you 5 Democrats who won’t vote for her. If they take it back by 25, there may be enough wrangling room for her to get the 218.” If Democrats win, they will have elected an historic number of women to the House. “I don’t think anyone is going to turn around and say let’s get rid of the only woman who’s ever served as leader of a political party in Congress, and replace her with an older man. I just don’t buy it,” says a House leadership aide, who asked for anonymity.The older man is House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who has been the second in command to Pelosi for the last 16 years. Hoyer is popular with his colleagues, and facilitating his lifelong dream of becoming speaker would be a Hollywood musical ending, but in the 21st century, how do Democrats, if they win the majority championing change, go from Pelosi to a 79-year-old white male Democrat to lead a majority minority caucus? “That’s not the trajectory of the party or the country,” says John Lawrence, Pelosi’s former chief of staff and founder of the blog, DOMEocracy. Lawrence recalled to The Daily Beast his discussions with Pelosi in past leadership fights. In 2016, almost a third of House Democrats voted against Pelosi in a secret ballot. Pelosi is fine with Democrats doing what they must do to win in November. “Her focus is winning the majority, and the rest will take care of itself,” says Lawrence. “She always says, ‘If you don’t have 218 votes, we’re just having a conversation.” The leadership vote is a two-step process with a secret ballot first in the caucus, followed by a public vote on the floor of the House. There is a lot of loyalty to Pelosi in the caucus. She’s been assiduous in placing women and minorities in key posts, and her fundraising prowess is unparalleled. Democrats owe her. She’s had their backs for 16 years, since becoming the first woman to lead one of the parties in 2002, and later as speaker for four years after Democrats reclaimed the House in 2007.Whether Democrats will continue to honor that debt to Pelosi after the midterms depends on the outcome. “Democrats who campaigned on opposing Pelosi could find themselves in a dilemma,” says Lawrence. “If you wanted to avoid that dilemma, you can say I voted against her in the caucus, which is a secret ballot.”Then on the floor, when the choice is Pelosi or, say, Republican Kevin McCarthy, it’s a party-line vote. “If you’re new to Congress, and you’re part of the resistance, is your first vote to launch the Democratic Party into chaos? You may have to have your head examined to do that,” says Lawrence.The focus has been on the Republicans, and their succession fight now that Speaker Ryan has called it quits. But it could be as much of a mess on the Democratic side, says Wasserman. “Democrats are looking for a woman and a new generation and a moderate,” and Pelosi, Hoyer and a third top contender, New York Rep. Joe Crowley, a congenial Irishman from Queens, don’t meet those qualifications.

Cheri Bustos, a 56-year-old Democrat who represents a working-class district in Illinois, checks all the boxes and is working hard to mentor candidates, especially women.There’s even some buzz about drafting Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who has impressed his colleagues with his serious bearing on television in the face of repeated taunts from President Trump. But no one is directly challenging Pelosi. The first move is hers to make, and it will hinge on the outcome of the November elections. Crowley, her most obvious successor, recently introduced Pelosi as the next Speaker at an event in Washington honoring women. After the November elections, it will come down to what a newly emboldened Democratic caucus decides. “Our focus is on winning,” says Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s longtime spokesman. “But Nancy Pelosi always says her future is up to the members.”"},
 {'title': 'Welcome to Donald Trump’s Gelatin Presidency',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "This week brought yet another humiliation of a Trump cabinet official at the hands of the president himself. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley suffered the latest indignity when she claimed more sanctions on Russia would be coming shortly, only to have top White House officials say she was “confused” and—in a bit of damage control that really didn’t control much damage—out of the loop. The flap is just the latest example of the Trump presidency eschewing the traditional presidential practices of leadership, communications, and management. Not only did President Trump fail to adequately communicate his shifting positions regarding the potential sanctions, he hung one of his most respected assets out to dry—and then publicly blamed her. Why does this nonsense keep happening?It would be easy to write off the Trump Administration as a chaotic joke, but the incompetence we are witnessing is Trump reaping what he has sown. When you elect an inexperienced, “norm-breaking” president, you don’t get to pick and choose the norms you want to break. Trump’s managerial style is so unorthodox that you would be hard-pressed to find any successful leader who would honestly endorse his approach. Rather than studying great servant leaders (Jesus, Washington, Lincoln, et al.) or business and leadership gurus (Dale Carnegie, John Maxwell, Peter Drucker, et al.), Trump’s guide to leadership appears to be the cynical and Machiavellian 48 Laws of Power—and it shows.Let’s start at the beginning. A good leader must have a clear vision. Dr. Martin Luther King’s was a dream “that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” This was simple, inspirational, and motivational. What is Donald Trump’s vision? Trump’s campaign slogan—“Make America Great Again”—was a pretty good one. Good enough, in fact, that a similar (if more inclusive) slogan appeared on campaign posters for Ronald Reagan in 1984. It offered voters a Rorsach test; whatever they thought would make America great again, they could ascribe to the candidate. Amidst the blistering criticisms Trump leveled against his 2016 opponents, this core message even offered a hint of optimism: the suggestion was that it was still within our power to make America great again, if we elected Trump. However, the reason it works as a slogan is also the reason it fails as a governing philosophy. The way to make America great is generally left open to interpretation. “Don’t expect the president to ever have your back if things go wrong—even if it’s not your fault.”This choose-your-own-adventure style is problematic for people serving in an administration. In their book Leaders: Strategies for Taking Charge, Warren Bennis and Burt Nanis argue that a shared vision is important so that, “People can make difficult decisions without having to appeal to higher levels in the organization each time because they know what end results are desired.” The same principle applies to running a presidential administration. “Everybody around [Reagan] had a good idea of who he was and what he would do,” wrote Peggy Noonan. “He’d been in public life for twenty years, [and] they knew what he stood for.” Donald Trump never served in public office before, and nobody knows where he stands on big issues in part because, it seems, he doesn’t know where he stands either. Contrast that with Reagan: The Gipper’s promise to Make America Great Again was backed by a governing philosophy and conservative agenda that his subordinates intuitively understood.Now, consider the cases of Haley and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. They surely knew that Trump wanted to “make America great again,” and I’m sure they knew he wanted to put “America First.” But it’s unclear from one day to the next how that applies to diplomacy or sanctions. As said by Leon Panetta, former Secretary of Defense, Director of the CIA, and White House Chief of Staff: Trump is “erratic and very unpredictable.” As a result, not only are Trump’s subordinates not empowered to make decisions, they’re not even sure what those presidential decisions are. Of course, Trump’s subordinates aren’t the only ones left guessing. U.S. Senators also have no idea what he wants them to do. Should America re-enter the TPP or not? Nobody knows. How about DACA? Trump said he would “take the heat” regarding an immigration bill, but that promise didn’t last long. Okay, then how about gun control? Chuck Schumer said it’s “like negotiating with Jell-O.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.I hate to keep coming back to Reagan, but I think it’s instructive because Trump is in some ways like Reagan (see Henry Olsen). And yet, in so many other ways pertinent to this discussion, the two men couldn’t be more different. Aside from being the “great communicator,” Ronald Reagan was known as the great delegator. It sometimes got him in trouble (see Iran-Contra) but it also made him effective. “The way I work is to identify the problem, find the right individuals to do the job, and then let them go to it. I've found this invariably brings out the best in people. They seem to rise to their full capability, and in the long run you get more done,” Reagan explained in 1987. Reagan also backed up his people when the heat was on. James Strock, author of Reagan on Leadership, notes that, “Reagan’s unequivocal backing of the strong stance advocated by Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis in the PATCO strike put people inside and outside the administration that the chief executive would back up subordinates under challenge.” Now, compare this with Donald Trump’s version of leadership, which involves micromanagement and undermining his underlings. What message did Trump send to other subordinates by throwing Haley under the bus? I think the message is clear: Risk aversion is better than boldness. And don’t expect the president to ever have your back if things go wrong—even if it’s not your fault. If you wonder why morale is low, leaks occur, and staff turnover is high, this is the probable reason. In the end, these problems stem from a fundamental flaw. The president lacks integrity, grace, humility, dignity, courage, and empathy. As Steven Covey put it in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, “Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty. Honesty is telling the truth—in other words,\xa0conforming our words to reality. Integrity is\xa0conforming reality to our words—in other words, keeping promises and fulfilling expectations.”What is the impact of a capricious president who lacks vision and undermines his aides? Nobody knows. But what’s become pretty evident is that Schumer was right: This presidency is Jell-O. "},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Samuel Rayburn served as speaker of the House for over 17 years. Tip O’Neill held the position for 10. Both were exceptions to the rule. Most speakers don’t serve long terms and most go on to leave a legacy within Congress and over legislation. Rarely, if ever, do they become personifications of a national moment. That’s because the speaker’s gavel comes with a ticking clock and the knowledge that, like buying a boat, it sounds fun but your happiest days with it will be your first and your last.You are, at the heart, a caretaker of a body that will last beyond you—a political leader in the institutional, not personal, sense. And yet, despite that, and despite short terms being the norm, ambitious members of Congress have always sought the position. Today, the familiar refrain in Washington about being speaker is “who would want that job?” But the truth is, a lot of lawmakers do. With Paul Ryan’s announced retirement on Wednesday, we are reminded once more that for all the power and allure, the speakership is now term-limited in spirit, with the pressures of the conference and national politics slowly eating away at any mandate you have to serve and making even two-year terms look like an eternal race for survival.A speaker must have five things to succeed: 1) Policy expertise; 2) Process expertise; 3) Support of the conference (party); 4) Fundraising prowess; and 5) Support among national primary electorate. The last one is new. The support of the conference used to be enough, but in today’s Congress intra-party support depends on your broader popular appeal. Ryan used to have that by the truckload. Until he didn’t.Going back to when Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate, one must recall that Ryan was the symbol of the party’s future: youthful, wonkish, humble, and solidly conservative. The old joke (or insult depending on your audience) was that Ryan was created in a laboratory in The Heritage Foundation. As a national candidate, he was more than appealing, he was the face of serious governing. Fast-forward to John Boehner’s departure. Ryan became the only logical successor. He had the policy and process expertise after serving as chairman of the Ways and Means and Budget Committees. He had also consistently been in the room with leadership when big decisions needed to be made, which made him both trusted and someone whose guidance was considered invaluable. Ryan had the support of the conference. And when Boehner left, he was practically forced into the job. But the support among the party faithful was waning as his name ID grew and inside agitators rose. He became the face of a supremely unpopular institution and the target of a group of members whose only purpose is to thwart leadership and score conservative media and grassroots adulation. The cliques within the conference became increasingly tribal and began serving little interest other than self-promotion and the lust over pointless scorecards.Ryan’s support within the broader conference also waned, not because he had become a different figure from the one they’d previously loved. He was speaker now, and thus the place for them to lay all the blame of their broken promises and unmet expectations fell at his feet. Shouldering that burden is so much a part of the job that leaders often tell reluctant but vulnerable members to do so. Ryan knew this and played along gamefully.Indeed, one of the most misunderstood parts about being speaker is who he or she actually represents. Yes, they represent their district. But inside the Capitol, they represent their conference: a group that grows more polarized by the day with safer districts, unrealistic demands, and a shallow depth of policy acumen.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.When Ryan critics say he didn’t stand up to President Trump enough, it stems from this misunderstanding. Members of the conference expected him to represent their collective will, and the will to defy and castigate the president has never existed. That was to my great regret as the well as the regret of others. But Ryan chose to see it as an opportunity to pass an agenda largely in line with his own: tax cuts and other unheralded items but probably not as much as he would’ve liked. He will leave with a spending record that surely aggravates him.There was still dysfunction, of course. But that is a result of the incremental loss of the leverages of leadership that preceded his tenure. The loss of earmarks not only abdicated fiscal decisions to the faceless and unaccountable bureaucracy, but it took members attention away from their districts. Without individual spending priorities, all of their attention is placed on the day-to-day grind of national politics. Budgets don’t get passed and compromise within the party and across the aisle becomes a daunting if not insurmountable task.Ryan’s critics on the left (and among a number of conservatives too) will ask why he didn’t serve as more of a protector of the institution of Congress against a seemingly unhinged executive. Certainly, President Trump will loom large over Ryan’s legacy, much as it will the tenure of Ryan’s successor. The first question in the first interview Ryan received after his announcement was about a porn star, illicit payments, and Access Hollywood tapes.Ryan’s critics on the right will question the timing of the announcement as the Republican Party enters, what is objectively, one of its most difficult electoral paths in recent memory. With his retirement, a Democratic wave seems more certain. A Democratic speaker seems closer to a reality. But a change in party control won’t wipe away the factors that led to Paul Ryan’s departure. Whether it’s Nancy Pelosi or Steny Hoyer, or a more youthful Democrat (perhaps someone under 75 years old) who becomes the next speaker, he or she will face many of the same problems: polarized members, tribal caucuses, and unrealistic expectations.Maybe it’s better to just buy a boat.Rory Cooper is a former communications director to Majority Leader Eric Cantor, former White House adviser to President George W. Bush, and currently a managing director at Purple Strategies."},
 {'title': 'Senator Jeff Flake to Harvard Law Grads: Trump ‘Debased’ Presidency',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In highly charged and notably ominous terms, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) on Wednesday laid bare his fears about the damage Donald Trump was inflicting on the office he holds, and called out his fellow Republicans for lacking the spine to fight to it.“Our presidency has been debased by a figure who has a seemingly bottomless appetite for destruction and division and only a passing familiarity with how the Constitution works,” Flake declared, according to an advanced copy of the commencement address he was delivering to graduates of the Harvard School of Law. “And our Article I branch of government, the Congress, is utterly supine in the face of the moral vandalism that flows from the White House daily.” Flake’s rebukes of Trump are hardly new. Since announcing his retirement from Congress, he has been one of a handful of vocal Republican critics of the president, even going to the well of the Senate to deliver his broadsides. But the language he offered on Wednesday was of a different scale and scope than speeches past. And it was peppered with a dourness not usually seen at generally optimism-tinged commencement speeches. “All is not well,” Flake told graduates at one point, “We have a sickness of the spirit.” At another moment, he openly wondered whether, societally, the country had bottomed out. \xa0“This is it, if you have been wondering what the bottom looks like,” he said, per his prepared remarks. “This is what it looks like when you stress-test all of the institutions that undergird our constitutional democracy, at the same time. You could say that we are witnesses to history, and if it were possible to divorce ourselves from the obvious tragedy of this debacle, I suppose that might even be interesting, from an academic perspective. The way some rare diseases are interesting to medical researchers.” In an interview with The Daily Beast hours before he took the stage, Flake stressed that the latter half of his speech was more upbeat; which it was, in its encouragement of graduates to go into the breach of civil and political service at a time of both great need and opportunity. “[O]pposing this president and much of what he stands for is not an act of apostasy—it is, rather, an act of fidelity,” Flake says at one point. \xa0But the main thrust of the speech, Flake told The Daily Beast, reflects his belief  that the calamities facing the country had only “deepened” since his speech on the Senate floor last fall, inching the country closer and closer to a “constitutional crisis.” Under such stress, certain political institutions have held. The press, he argued, was one. The Department of Justice was another, he said, \xa0giving specific kudos to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for navigating the proto-authoritarian demands of a president to, among other things, investigate those investigating him. It was the institution he was in, and the party which he occupies, that had so far failed the test. “I hope that more of my colleagues would speak up,” Flake told The Daily Beast. “Sometimes we are starting to look more and more like the cabinet meeting [with members exhibiting overwhelming obsequiousness to Trump]. And that’s concerning. This is an independent branch of government. We have to more jealously guard our prerogatives.”For all his tough words, Flake’s vision of a Congress actually standing as a bulwark against Trump is notably less combative than some the president’s liberal agitators would prefer. The senator, for instance, supported a bill to shield Special Counsel Robert Mueller from a presidential firing. But he also said he recognizes concerns over that bill’s constitutionality. Flake acknowledged that he votes consistently with the president’s legislative agenda but argued that it was misplaced to demand that he “ought to hobble” Trump on items in which they had ideological agreement. He had opposed certain Trump nominees, including just confirmed CIA Director Gina Haspel, and worked behind the scenes with the White House to defeat others before they were announced. But “my feeling is that unless there is something disqualifying, the president ought to get his or her choices,” he explained.

Passing an Authorization for Use of Military Force is a start. Moving an immigration bill to the president’s desk even if the president vetoes it, would be another step forward. Flake suspects that this is what voters want too. And as he gets set to depart the Senate, his suspicion is that things actually might get better—that the country has, indeed, reached bottom—once those acting in a “supine” manner are forced to depart too. “I do think that elections are pretty clarifying. Nothing clarifies like a bad election loss and we may be heading there as Republicans,” Flake said. “Whether I wish it or not, I do think it is coming. And I think we brought this on ourselves.”"},
 {'title': 'Dem Groups Are Ratcheting Up the Judicial Wars—And They’re Targeting Fellow Democrats',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In a rare political volley in the judicial wars, a trio of outside Democratic-aligned groups is going after members of its own party in a newly launched ad campaign. The campaign, spearheaded by the new outfit Demand Justice, demands that Democratic senators commit to voting en masse against any of Donald Trump’s judicial nominees should Senate Republicans advance one without the formal sign-off of his or her home-state senator. Such a sign-off is known, in congressional parlance, as the blue slip. Though it was always an informal courtesy, for decades it was treated as a procedural backstop for the confirmation of federal judges. But this past October, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), with his eyes on stacking the judiciary with conservative justices, announced his intention to dispense with the concept. A month later, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) followed suit. Because of Sen. Al Franken’s abrupt resignation, the Senate in full has never formally voted on a nominee who made it through the committee without a blue slip (the Minnesota Democrat was gone by the time David Stras was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals). But such a scenario is likely to present itself his week, when the Senate is expected to consider the nomination of Michael Brennan, a Milwaukee lawyer, to serve on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Brennan does not have a blue slip from one of his home-state senators, Tammy Baldwin. But what’s further enraged Democrats is the history of the post he is set to occupy. For years, that seat on the Seventh Circuit was held open because Wisconsin’s other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, refused to return his own blue slip for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Victoria Nourse. Brennan himself was quoted as applauding the resulting vacancy. “[T]here are now two senators from Wisconsin from different political parties,” he wrote, “so to exclude Johnson and those citizens who voted for him would be a purely partisan move.”In the newly launched ad campaign, Demand Justice—along with progressive-minded groups People for the American Way and Leadership Conference and Alliance for Justice—paints the Brennan vote as a Rubicon moment for the chamber and Democrats in particular. “We need you to tell Democratic senators this is not business as usual,” the ad reads. “If Brennan is confirmed, all Democrats must commit that they will not vote for any more of Trump’s judicial nominees, full stop.”The advertisement is digital-only and designed, in part, to juice the number of email addresses the groups can collect for future calls-to-action. But according to a Demand Justice spokesman, there will be “five-figures” behind the push. So far, Senate Democratic aides say there has not been talk of getting a commitment within the party to vote against any Donald Trump nominee—or, even, any nominee who does not have a blue slip—should Senate Republicans reject the blue-slip process. But that’s partially the purpose of the ad campaign: to up the pressure for such talks to begin. And there is some urgency, Demand Justice argues. In addition to Brennan, the Senate Judiciary Committee is set to hold a hearing for Ryan Bounds’ nomination to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. A federal prosecutor for the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Bounds does not have a blue slip from either of his home-state senators—Ron Wyden or Jeff Merkley. But the bigger battle looms on the horizon, with three seats for the liberal-leaning Ninth Circuit that would, traditionally, require the sign-offs of California’s senators (both Democrats).Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

And Trump will be able to move our courts even further to the extreme right,” the Demand Justice ad reads. “Already, Republicans are starting to push through a Trump pick from Oregon who is opposed by both of his home state senators and after that, Trump could steamroll Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris on a group of judge picks from California.”"},
 {'title': 'Exiting House Republicans See a ‘Big Wave Coming’ After Speaker Paul Ryan Calls It In',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Tears were shed in the closed-door Republican meeting Wednesday morning when House Speaker Paul Ryan formally announced his retirement. The sorrow spilled into the marble halls of the Capitol, giving the building the air of a funeral parlor throughout the day, but critics say that had more to do with the rotting corpse that is the contemporary GOP than with Ryan’s early departure.Still, most Republicans followed Ryan’s lead and tried to put on a happy face, arguing that his retirement had to do with his desire to spend time with his kids, not the dire odds facing the GOP this fall. “I really do not believe whether I stay or go in 2019 is going to affect a person’s individual race for Congress,” Ryan told reporters at a press conference overflowing with reporters. “I’m grateful that we have unified government, that the president with his victory gave us, so we got all these big things done. We’re going to have a great record to run on. We have a great economy. Great accomplishments.”Ryan’s record since taking the speaker’s gavel is largely the same as Trump’s, which means he’s ushered through a sweeping tax reform proposal, rolled back a slate of Obama-era regulations, and unwound the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. That’s why many Republicans had anticipated Ryan’s retirement.“Being speaker in this environment, with the dynamic in the Congress the way that they are, there’s a tremendous amount of wear and tear, right? So, how long do you do it and what are your objectives?” retiring Rep. Ryan Costello (R-PA) told The Daily Beast.Ryan also was able to keep many of the inter-party food fights that dragged down former Speaker John Boehner from seeing the light of day on his watch, in part because he had a Republican in the White House. But that Republican was Donald Trump who, Costello argued, Ryan handled perfectly, especially when it came to Trump’s knee-jerk Twitter habit.“I think he handled that expertly and spent very little time dealing with it. I mean, what did he do? He said, ‘I didn’t read it this morning’ or ‘I haven’t really thought about it.’ I mean, I don’t think he really spent much time worrying about that stuff. I think he got, candidly, I think he got a hall pass on that stuff largely,” Costello argued. But Ryan also helped Trump and the GOP balloon the federal deficit, and the speaker carried water for the president at every turn. He did that even as polls continuously showed Trump with historically low approval ratings. Ryan never pivoted to the middle or changed the party’s agenda, even as his party lost election after election after election since taking over the White House and reclaiming the Senate. That has some in the GOP warning their colleagues to stop pretending that positive short-term economic indicators and an election map that largely tilts in their favor will be enough to carry the party to victory this fall. On Wednesday Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL) also announced he’s retiring, which means more than 40 Republicans are leaving open seats up for grabs. “Sure, I mean, open seats are open seats. Whether they’re Republican or Democrat, depending on where they are they’re much more competitive than the seat that is held by the incumbent,” Rep. Phil Roe (R-TN) told The Daily Beast. “It’s amazing to me. I didn’t realize it when I got here what an advantage being an incumbent is. You’re out there and you just have this built-in advantage if you take advantage of it, if you go do those kinds of things. If you’re going to four or five, five or six days a week you’re meeting and getting a lot of name recognition. You get a lot of publicity.”Since Trump became president, Democrats have now won gubernatorial contests in Virginia and New Jersey, a special election in Alabama, and last month the party shocked political watchers when Conor Lamb won a special election in a Pennsylvania district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016.“I’ll tell you what. If people didn’t get the message from that race in southwestern Pennsylvania, well they’ll never get a message,” retiring Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) told The Daily Beast. “If you live in a swing or marginal district, if a member represents a swing or marginal district, he or she knows that they have to run the hardest, most serious campaign in their lives.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Let’s be honest,” Dent said. “We shouldn’t be kidding ourselves about this: Big wave coming—get off the beach.”Party leaders, though, are sticking to Ryan’s talking points and arguing his early exit won’t impact other races. \xa0“I don’t think so,” Rep. Steve Stivers (R-OH), who is in charge of the House Republican re-election efforts, told The Daily Beast before he hastily stormed onto the House floor. “Yeah, I don’t. Thank you.”Democrats say the GOP leadership under Trump has remained in a perpetual state of reality-TV-induced mental coma about their party’s unpopular president and agenda. Now they say it extends to how they’re spinning Speaker Ryan’s departure. “What else are they going to say? They’re not going to declare defeat,” Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), the deputy chair of the DNC, told The Daily Beast. “They’re going to fight back. I mean, they’re in it to win it just like we are, but I mean it’s not a good sign. It’s chaos.” Ellison said Ryan’s departure won’t change his party’s strategy this fall, which he said includes registering new voters and continuing to excite voter turnout nationwide. But other Democrats argue Ryan is smart and that his departure at age 49, after serving a mere three years as speaker, shows that he saw the writing on the wall.“A sitting speaker… throws in the towel halfway through the year, a midterm election year where the stakes are enormous? I call that seismic,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) told The Daily Beast. “I mean, it’s almost tantamount to admitting ‘We’re unlikely to maintain our majority. I’m unlikely to be speaker again because of that, and I’d rather retire than face that.’”Connolly argued that members of his own party wore similar beer goggles not so long ago. “There’s no end of delusional thinking in Washington,” he said. “Especially when you’re facing the prospect of your own demise, you grasp at all kinds of straws to avoid dealing with it forthrightly. I would say on our side, in the 2010 midterm election there was some of that on the Democratic side, but I don’t think it equips you for coping with it.”"},

However, he did hint that Wednesday was a tumultuous day for him. “Yesterday, in frustration, I said I don’t know if I want to do this anymore,” Garrett said. “Legislatively, it’s like pounding your head perpetually against a brick wall,” he told reporters of his job. When asked why Garrett thought he might not run again, the congressman replied: “the frustration.”More specifically, Garrett spoke for a while about his frustration with the fact that former University of Virginia women’s basketball coach Joanne Boyle has had a complicated path to obtaining citizenship for her adopted daughter Ngoty, who is from Senegal. He also praised his chief of staff and said he wasn’t fired but declined to go into further details on what happened. “Stuff happens,” Garrett summarized, effectively capping off a press conference about nothing.'},

It’s the type of place where the wealthy mingle, and where diplomats and businessmen gather to share stories and, occasionally, talk business. The main restaurant in the five star hotel, La Terrazza, advertises its “fine dining experience with equally spectacular views.” The cheapest option on its a la carte menu runs at 130 Euros per person; the most expensive option (which came with a wine pairing) ran at 280 Euros. Pruitt dined with two others that night: Ryan Jackson, his chief of staff, and Samantha Dravis, his former top aide who has since left the EPA.The stop at Hotel Eden was just one, two-hour window on a two-day swing through Rome. But for Pruitt’s critics, it, and the trip in general, is emblematic of a cabinet official who has spent lavishly on himself while living off the taxpayer dime; a proclivity that extends to a taste in fine restaurants in Washington D.C. as well. The total cost of the Italy trip, which included an swing to Bologna to meet with environmental ministers, ran $120,000, according to previously reported EPA documents. Pruitt defended that price tag by stressing that he was taking “very important meetings” along the way. He called the trip “an obligation” and said he was “a little bit dumbfounded by the kind of media narrative that these things are somehow not the focus.” His aides point out that the administrator and each of his staffers are given per-diems when traveling abroad, and that any expenses exceeding them are paid out of pocket, not billed to taxpayers (though much of the costs Pruitt ran up related to the massive security detail he used while abroad).But the specific details of Pruitt’s trip, which were published on Monday as part of a massive trove of documents obtained by the environmental group Sierra Club, show that official work events made up a relatively small portion of his time in Rome. In all, Pruitt held four work events over the course of just under 48-hours in the city. They included a meeting with Kelly Degnan, the U.S. Mission Italy's Deputy Chief of Mission; a roundtable of business leaders to discuss environmental innovation, a meeting with the Vatican’s ministry of foreign affairs; and a judicial roundtable on environmental law. All told, those four work-related events took up four hours of Pruitt’s time, according to his schedule. By contrast, Pruitt had three private, non-work related meals, including his stop at Hotel Eden, which took up 5.5 hours of his schedule. He also took a private tour of the Vatican Library, a private tour of the Scavi, and a private tour of the Apostolic Palace, which took up 3.5 hours of his schedule. Pruitt also had a private mass at the Vatican, which was reportedly arranged for him Leonard Leo, the head of the conservative Federalist SocietyEPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox defended the trip on Monday, noting that it was comparable in activity and expense to previous junkets taken by Pruitt’s predecessors in the Obama administration.Wilcox provided documentation showing that Gina McCarthy, Obama’s second EPA administrator, spent about $71,000 on a trip to Italy and the Vatican, and brought eleven staff members with her. Pruitt’s trip, on which he was joined by ten staff members, cost about $120,000, though Wilcox noted that that sum included a chartered military jet from Cincinnati to New York, where Pruitt boarded a flight to Italy. That chartered flight cost about $36,000, according to an ABC News report.Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune on Monday, noted that the group had to take Pruitt to court in order to get a copy of his schedule.

 {'title': 'Beto O’Rourke: I Would Vote to Impeach Trump',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Democratic lawmaker challenging Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in the 2018 midterms said Monday that he would vote to impeach President Trump.Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) was asked by host Chad Hasty of KFYO-AM in Lubbock whether he has seen enough evidence thus far to support a hypothetical impeachment of the president. O’Rourke initially responded: “The answer is yes.”“I want to be straight with you,” the rising Democratic star continued. “I’ve seen an attempt—no matter how ham-handed—to collude with a foreign government in our national election. I’ve seen an effort to obstruct justice in the investigation of what happened in the 2016 election.”However, as O’Rourke continued, he said that impeachment is not something that will happen imminently or prior to the conclusion of special counsel Bob Mueller’s investigation. “We must await all the facts, all the truth, all the information forthcoming from the Bob Mueller investigation,” O’Rourke explained. “So the most important thing to me is to safeguard the independence and the integrity of the Mueller investigation. Because here’s the thing: impeachment doesn't make any sense right now. Until you have reached the point that the facts are so compelling that a Republican colleague—it may be Jodey Arrington, it may be someone else—is able to come before their constituents and explain how they voted to impeach the president of their own party.”He concluded: “We are not there yet. So I’m going to stay focused on the issues that we can make a difference on right now. And we’ll leave this until we get the conclusion of that investigation.”These remarks are not entirely new for O'Rourke, as he said last August that he was supportive of the notion of impeachment but wanted Trump to be “successful” and spoke of areas where the two of them could work together.The Democratic challenger has ignited a firestorm in Texas, raising more than $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2018—all while streaming his incessant treks across the state of Texas as he attempts to meet every possible future constituent.  The O’Rourke campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},

  'body': "Of course, he’s going to fire Mueller.Of course, it’s going to trigger a constitutional crisis.Of course, Republicans will do nothing.Every single day, Tyrannosaurus Don tests the limits of his enclosure. Every day, he pushes against the walls, looking for weak spots and for places where the electric fence isn’t working. Outside, the zookeepers in this Jurassic political park toss a cow carcass over the wall, praise their big boy dino, and marvel how large his fingers look. They smile and congratulate themselves that they’ve appeased the monster for another day, managing its violent, ravenous urges.The beast never rests, though. It’s never satisfied with boundaries, limits, laws, or traditions. Every day, Trump wants what he wants, even if it destroys everything around him. What he wants right now is to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, end the Russia investigation, and prevent his allies, friends, and family members from being sent to the Graybar Hotel and his legacy to the dustbin of history. Republicans who believe firing Mueller will change the political dynamic and free Trump to do whatever the hell they think he’d do without the special counsel on the scene are dreaming. Trump is already permanently stained, a president with an asterisk next to his name, a joke, a con, and a political poison that’s devouring their campaigns and their legacies. Even the White House clown bus of mooks, slowcoaches, edge case cranks, and kissers of his double-wide backside seem to understand more than the GOP in Congress; he’s crazier than a rat in a septic tank, and only Congress has any power over his behavior. The Trump signals that he’s going to fire Robert Mueller need a more real, vigorous, and blunt response than any member of the House or Senate has yet provided. For being such fans of the Constitution, Republicans seems to have forgotten they’re in a co-equal branch of government and swore an oath to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Dismissing the special counsel in the middle of an investigation of foreign interference, obstruction of justice, and ties to hostile foreign powers isn’t just reckless; it’s politically idiotic.I understand the argument that both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell need to calibrate their remarks to stay in the middle of the sentiment of their respective caucuses. Paul Ryan knows the Trump-hadis, yahoos, InfoWars conspiracy fanboys (looking at you, Matt Gaetz), dead-enders, and political anarchists on his right flank are restive, worrisome, and would stone him to death in a hot minute if Trump asked them to do so. In the center of the GOP caucus, the sense of doom is so thick you can cut it with a knife. For McConnell, his crafty, baroque mental calculus is less clear, but with Jeff Flake and John McCain headed out the door, he’s left with almost no one willing to publicly stand up and take on this president. For all that, both men are on the hot seat this week as Trump edges closer to Muellerdämmerung. McConnell’s statement on Tuesday was a Rorschach test. Some praised it for being a clear signal, and it was to the D.C. media. For Trump? Not as much. “Bob Mueller should be allowed to finish his job. I think it was an excellent appointment. I think he will go wherever the facts lead him and I think he will have great credibility with the American people when he reaches the conclusion of this investigation. So I have a lot of confidence,” McConnell said. “This is a thoroughly credible individual, I think it was an appropriate appointment, and we all anticipate his finishing the job and telling the American people what they need to know about this episode.”Ryan’s statement on Mueller was deeply embarrassing. “I received assurances that his firing is not even under consideration,” said the speaker of the House, before noting he had to get back and reply to an urgent email from a Nigerian prince, finalize a bridge purchase, and order some totally legit Viagra from ReelMedz4U.ru.My first response was, “Are you kidding me?” For this president, these statements didn’t even rise to the level of a mild, hypothetical caution, much less a reprimand. Just as a rat can crawl into spaces that seem impossibly tight, Trump looks at these elliptical, subtle signals as a sign he can fire Mueller and get away with it.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In Trump’s mind, their statements were nothing. They weren’t warnings; they were permission slips.Donald Trump isn’t subtle. He isn’t strategic. He needs to be told in vivid, sharp, clear words, “If you do this, you’re going to be impeached, dragged hard, humiliated, investigated, have your taxes made public, pictures of your junk on poster boards as we discuss porn star payoffs on the Senate floor.” He needs to hear it loud and clear; “We know you’ve already wrecked our chances of holding the majority, but we’re not letting you drag the country down with us.”The way to accomplish this is by passing legislation that protects the special counsel from Trump’s obstruction and tampering. The chances of that are roughly the same as me waking up tomorrow 50 pounds lighter and with a full mane of luxurious golden hair.Understanding how to contain Donald Trump isn’t complicated. In every single domain of his entire life, Donald Trump is a cheater. This isn’t ad hominem. It’s documented fact in every part of his career in business, marriage, and politics. He will take advantage of any leeway, loophole, gullibility, or porn starlet he sees. Donald Trump views red lines as green lights. The transgressive, disruptive nature of Trump is beloved by his base, and by an army of formerly conservative writers now eagerly fluffing the president’s rampant statism, corruption, and obstruction. They desperately want the narrative to become, “Donald the Magnificent girds his loins, defeats Mueller and evil sorceress Hillary in single combat, as bountiful harvests and happy peasants follow. Bards sing his praises for a thousand years.”Even if Republicans believe Mueller ought to be fired, and hate him for being the skunk at the garden party of Trumpism, their political fortunes rest in part on whether voters see them as accomplices to a lawless, dishonest, corrupt president. If Trumpism is so powerfully hypnotic that they put their political survival after this president’s whims, I suppose they’re beyond counsel and help, but it hasn’t stopped me from trying. For over a year, I have warned members of House and the Senate that Trump’s erratic behavior, shitbird affect, Putin-philia, moronic economic beliefs, hair-trigger temper, evident political disloyalty, and grunting, reckless dick-swinging bravado would rebound on them, and hard. The things Trump does please a narrow base repel everyone else. Trump voters are loyal to Trump, not to the GOP and certainly not to its members. Other Republicans take all the damage and reap none of the benefits. In race after race, we’ve seen the future, and for Republicans, it’s dark. I’ve warned Republicans before he is driving an electoral and demographic wedge in American politics we can’t easily overcome, and imposing on the party a suite of problems no amount of money or Democratic Party campaign incompetence will solve.The idea that the tax bill would save the GOP is so three months ago. It won’t. Trump has consumed the political space like a hungry singularity, dragging every issue, every policy, every one of the precious, focus-grouped “this’ll work” message points into the well of his entropic gravity. Firing Mueller will set off a chain of political consequences so far-reaching, and a crisis so sharp that Republicans will be marked by it for generations in the political wilderness. This will make 1974 look like high tea. Trump repays loyalty with betrayal, obedience with abuse, and compliance with humiliation. Inaction, silence, acquiescence on firing Mueller and the political firestorm to follow is inevitable unless Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell personally step up, give Trump a clear warning even the slowest president in modern history could understand, and pass legislation to protect the special counsel’s work."},

  'body': 'Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Sunday that the United States was temporarily halting its planned tariffs on Chinese imports while the two nations continue to negotiate.“We’re putting the trade war on hold,” Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday, adding that the U.S. and China agreed to a framework whereby China would buy more goods from the U.S. in order to make up for the trade deficit between the two countries.The announcement came after top Chinese officials visited Washington last week for negotiations on the Trump administration’s trade policies. The president had previously revealed plans to impose tariffs on $150 billion on Chinese imports, a move that angered conservatives economists and members of his own party on Capitol Hill. China responded at the time by threatening tariffs on American goods, which could have sparked an all-out trade war.Mnuchin declined to discuss the details of the framework, which the White House and Beijing said included “meaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a statement on Sunday commending President Donald Trump but warned that the negotiators “shouldn’t blow it” by allowing intellectual-property concerns and Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE—which has been the target of and has violated U.S. sanctions—to go unaddressed.“[Trump] could always decide to put the tariffs back on if China doesn’t go through with their commitment,” said Mnuchin, addressing concerns that a simple promise from China to buy more U.S. products wouldn’t be sufficient.Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, said on ABC’s This Week that ZTE would not “get off scot-free,” but added that the U.S. was willing to work with China on “some small changes around the edges” to the company.The U.S. trade deficit with China topped $375 billion last year. Kudlow said China would increase its purchases of American goods by a “rough ballpark estimate” of $200 billion.'},
 {'title': 'Team Hillary: Comey Should ‘Beg Forgiveness,’ Not Hawk Book',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "While James Comey’s upcoming book tour seems bound to trigger President Donald Trump in potentially dramatic ways, another group of politicos also remains on edge over the former FBI director’s return to the national stage. Veterans of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign say they expect the former secretary of state to take a few shots in the pages of\xa0A Higher Loyalty. And while there is no consensus plan to push back on Comey, they won’t be holding their counter-punches either. “Just because Jim Comey sees himself as a hero, I don’t think the rest of the country will necessarily see him as a hero,” Philippe Reines, former adviser to Clinton told The Daily Beast in an interview. Few book tours have come with as much anticipation as the one on which Comey is about to embark. That’s largely because of the conditions under which the former FBI Director was fired by Trump, and the possibility that he could shed some light on the remaining vagaries of the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. But the promotion of A Higher Loyalty seems likely to be as much about Comey’s desire to rehabilitate his own image as it is about settling old scores. And for that reason, it is widely expected that the former FBI Director will use a good chunk of his pages to address his handling of the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. For Reines, the expectation is that Comey will leave out the self-reflection as he casts himself as a stalwart beacon of justice who was repeatedly confronted with the worst of the swamp. \xa0“I just have the hardest job in the world doing the right thing all the time,” said Reines, playfully mocking the tone he predicted the former FBI director would take. “And. Lordy, people make that tough on me to do the right thing and no matter how hard they get on me, I just keep doing the right thing and boy am I exhausted of doing the right thing.” The Clinton political operation is famous for gaming out ways to undermine critical books, going so far as to get their hands on early copies to call into question the veracity of the work before it is released. But sources inside the Clinton alumni network insist that there is no such formal plan for Comey (perhaps because the book has been under lock and key). “No large scale pushback has been organized” and maybe none at all, is what one Clinton insider said. “I’m sure some folks have put their heads together. But they haven’t convened a conference call for the wider universe and no talking points have been pass around widely.”The absence of a plan doesn’t mean that there will be an absence of any pushback at all. Reines is buying the book, he said— “It’s not like I spent my one Amazon book credit on Jim Comey”— and he and others continue to harbor anger at Comey for—in their estimation—costing her the election, both with his decision to castigate Clinton on live television in the summer of 2016 and in announcing a reopening of the email investigation in October.“Why the fuck does he think it’s ok to just reopen an investigation 10 days before an election?” said Reines. “He feels a need to tell the country that Hillary Clinton is the most guilty innocent person that he’s ever looked into but neglects to mention to the same country that Donald Trump appears to be the most guilty guilty person he’s in the middle of looking at. Why? I don’t think these are things his book is going to answer for us.”Though lacking her long-time aide’s colorful language, Clinton has pushed back on Comey herself. In her book, What Happened, she said she regretted not going after Comey harder in a public setting during the campaign. “My first instinct was that my campaign should hit back hard and explain to the public that Comey had badly overstepped his bounds—the same argument [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein would make months after the election,” Clinton wrote. “That might have blunted the political damage and made Comey think twice before breaking protocol again a few months later.”Comey, for his part, has defended his actions during the campaign by portraying them as the result of taking the best of two bad options. The thought of possibly swaying the election’s outcome made him “mildly nauseous,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee—a statement that may have mollified some lawmakers but has remained too bitter for many Clinton vets to swallow.

Aides to the Democratic nominee are also interested in seeing if he provides additional insight into the role Russia played in undermining her campaign. That’s especially true as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion heats up, and with news on Monday that the FBI raided the office and home of Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen. “James Comey has had ample opportunity to explain why he made a public spectacle of the email issue against Department of Justice protocol and it’s still a mystery,” Nick Merrill, communications director for Clinton told The Daily Beast. “An even bigger mystery is why he did so while keeping an investigation into Trump and his ties to Russia under wraps. There is ample evidence that his actions affected [the] outcome of the election, so unless his book includes directions on how to build a time machine, I’m not sure what value it will have at this point.”While some in the Clinton orbit remained skeptical that they would get any new answers to their questions, others suggested that the former FBI director will be forced to lay out some specifics. Comey, after all, is untethered now and detached from the difficult balance he had to strike as an FBI Director. He is now a private citizen. “I welcome the book tour,” a staffer close to the Clinton campaign, requesting to speak on background, told The Daily Beast. “I want him to answer a lot of questions. \xa0He has never been held accountable for what he did because he used his official position to evade questions from Congress and wouldn’t talk to the press. But this isn’t Director Comey anymore, this is citizen Comey and citizen Comey can’t choose what he answers and what he doesn’t. The press will force him to answer questions about the election and won’t allow him to dodge.”Jackie Kucinich and Sam Stein contributed reporting."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Republican senators really want Rudy Giuliani to stop talking—about hypotheticals, about crimes that nobody has been charged with yet, and about the special counsel’s investigation.On Monday, those lawmakers were peppered with questions about whether President Donald Trump can pardon himself, and whether the president—any president—can be indicted for obstruction of justice. It was mostly thanks to Giuliani, who over the weekend asserted, among other things, that Trump, as the president, could not legally be indicted even if he had shot former FBI Director James Comey instead of firing him.“I think it really is a distraction and I wish he wouldn’t comment on things like that because it raises questions that really have been laid to rest,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said.Cornyn echoed his GOP colleagues in expressing frustration that Giuliani, who in addition to his legal work has become a de facto political adviser to the president, has been publicly raising issues that they view as counterproductive—including the suggestion that the president could pardon himself if he is convicted of a federal crime.“I don’t know why we’re talking about it, honestly. We’re about to go into the North Korea summit. We’ve got to deal with immigration,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. “I don’t know why Rudy brought it up.”Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) bluntly suggested that Trump should fire Giuliani for even raising the possibility that the president would pardon himself, telling CNN: “If I were President of the United States and I had a lawyer that told me I could pardon myself, I think I would hire a new lawyer.”Republican senators pushed back substantively, too, against Trump’s lawyers who, in a January letter to special counsel Robert Mueller that The New York Times published on Saturday, argued that the president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice because his office gives him broad power over federal investigations. (A central aspect of Mueller’s inquiry is whether Trump obstructed Russia-related federal probes when he fired Comey last year.)“It is entirely possible for a president to obstruct justice—if a president committed perjury to lie to or mislead investigators, if he encouraged others to, if he destroyed evidence,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told The Daily Beast. “I could think of lots of ways that a president could obstruct justice. So it is theoretically possible.”Under the Constitution, members of the Senate would be responsible for voting to convict a sitting president and throw him or her out of office if the House of Representatives approves articles of impeachment. Several Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice are still serving today, and for the most part, they pledged to remain consistent on the matter.“I’ve always said I didn’t think anybody was above or below the law,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) told The Daily Beast. Added Grassley: “Nobody’s above the law. Otherwise we wouldn’t have a system of law.” On the issue of whether the president could pardon himself, GOP senators said such a move would amount to political suicide for Trump. But they questioned why Trump’s attorney—and the president himself, in a tweet early Monday morning—would even bring it up when Trump has not been formally accused of a crime.“He likes to get you guys writing and talking about stuff. He’s pretty good at it. But you can only pardon someone who has been charged with something. The president hasn’t been charged with anything,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Mark Warner (D-VA), the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “What’s he want to pardon himself for? Which of the various crimes that he said didn’t exist is he thinking about pardoning himself for? This is a disturbing pattern.”For his part, Giuliani told The Daily Beast on Monday that Trump would never pardon himself, adding that the “practical control” for such a move would be for Congress to impeach him. Republicans essentially promised to do just that.“If you buy the idea that the president—even though he’s the chief law enforcement officer of the land—is not above the law itself, then I think everything else falls in line,” Graham told The Daily Beast.Asawin Suebsaeng contributed reporting."},
 {'title': 'Center Holds for a Day, as No Labels Helps Right-Leaning Democrat Dan Lipinski Save His Seat From Progressive Challenger',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The empire struck back Tuesday in Illinois. After more than a year of the Democratic Resistance sucking up all the oxygen, Dan Lipinski, a 51-year-old conservative Democrat in a Southside Chicago working class district narrowly beat back a challenge from Marie Newman, a local activist endorsed by Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Emily’s List, and an impressive array of progressive groups. \xa0\xa0The primary was seen by both sides as emblematic of which wing of the party would dominate, and the surprise was not the narrowness of Lipinski’s win but that he won at all given all the energy on the Sanders side of the equation. The Democratic establishment represented by the DNC and the DCCC had pretty much given up on Lipinski. No Labels, a bipartisan centrist group, was the only outside group that spent significantly in support of the seven-term Democrat. “For us it was so important to make people understand all these races can’t be about one or two litmus test issues,” says Ryan Clancy, lead strategist for No Labels, whose ally Country Forward, put over a million dollars into the race to save Lipinski’s seat. \xa0\xa0Lipinski is not pro-choice, but he had Nancy Pelosi’s endorsement. Despite the Speaker’s personal views, she’s always taken the position that it is self-defeating to turn the choice issue on abortion rights into a litmus test for party identity. If Democrats are to regain the majority in the House, they will have to win in districts that are not solidly blue. One lesson from Lipinski’s win and before that the special election victory of Democrat Conor Lamb in a working-class district in Pennsylvania that had strongly supported Trump in 2016 is that lots of people may hold contrary views on social issues, but can be reached on bread-and-butter, kitchen table issues.Lipinski, now on an easy path to an eighth term after Republicans nominated despite party’s leaders repudiation a Holocaust-denying Nazi, is a member of the House Problem Solvers Caucus (PSC), which has 48 members evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. They have formulated proposals on health care and immigration, but have not gotten a vote on those proposals in the gridlocked Congress. No Labels expects to intervene in dozens of races this year against candidates on the left and the right, and they have the funding. “This is No Labels 3.0,” says Bill Galston, a Brookings scholar who advises the group. “We learned early on we were going to have a hard time mobilizing the center unless we gave concrete assurances that we would have their back if they took tough decisions and tough votes.” Financial investments in politics typically come from the left and the right, with the Koch Brothers and George Soros the poster boys. Mobilizing the center is a novel idea. “Many of them live in mortal fear of a primary. If we can show them that there’s an organized well-funded effort to protect them and push back against extremists, maybe we can embolden them to do the right thing even when it doesn’t make their base happy,” says Clancy. No Labels criteria: One, if any of the Problem Solvers Caucus members is facing a credible challenge, the group will step in, as they did with Lipinski.

And thirdly, “we may go after some incumbents who are being challenged,” says Clancy. No Labels and its PAC, Country Forward, are well funded. Ryan Clancy emailed at my request, the names of some of their biggest funders, three who lean left – Howard Marks with Oaktree Capital, Peter May with Trian Investors, and Peter Solomon, an investment banker—and three who lean right—Nelson Peltz with Trian Investors, Jerry Reinsdorf , owner of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Red Sox, and Craig Duchossois, chairman and CEO of the Duchossois Group. “This really is a bipartisan effort,” Clancy wrote.\xa0While the maligned and beleaguered center has bragging rights after Tuesday’s primary election in Illinois, the progressive groups that backed Marie Newman are not backing down and there are many more primary fights ahead. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee said in a statement: “Marie Newman did something few thought possible — she closed a 30-point gap against an entrenched incumbent. If she can come so close against an entrenched incumbent with all the power of incumbency and the local Democratic machine, progressives will win big in dozens of primaries this cycle when running on inspiring ideas against moderate Democrats who lack those advantages.” As a conservative anti-choice Democrat, Lipinski is way over on the outer edge of where most Democrats are today. He voted against the Affordable Care Act initially on religious freedom grounds, and he has a long record of anti-LGBT votes.The Democratic Party of yesteryear had many lawmakers like him, but they have fallen out of favor with primary voters, just as their more moderate GOP counterparts have been hallowed out by the far right. Lipinski Democrats are no longer the majority within the party, but the party needs them. Their voters gave Donald Trump the presidency. In Pennsylvania, where Democrats hold just five of the 18 congressional districts, a new map drawn by the state Supreme Court has made 11 of those districts competitive for Democrats. The same team that did the Conor Lamb victory worked for Lipinski, so there’s a pattern here that they hope can be replicated in the primaries ahead with candidates that are not necessarily drawn from the Resistance, but can win in November, and legislate across party lines. \xa0"},

  'body': "When Stormy Daniels’ former attorney spoke to CNN earlier this month, he said President Donald Trump’s loyal fixer had encouraged him to speak out. “He suggested that it would be appropriate for me to go out into the media and spill my guts,” Keith Davidson said of Trump’s embattled lawyer, Michael Cohen, a man who was supposed to be his legal opponent. Davidson negotiated hush agreements for two of the president’s alleged paramours—Daniels, the porn actress, and Karen McDougal, a onetime Playboy model—in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election.He inked Daniels’ deal with Cohen, who personally paid the adult actress $130,000 for her silence about the alleged Trump affair. And he was in touch with Cohen, too, after McDougal signed her “catch and kill” agreement with the publisher of the National Enquirer, which bought her story for the purpose of burying it.Indeed, the lawyers on opposite coasts appear to have developed a symbiotic relationship in recent years, beginning when details of Stormy Daniels’ Trump affair first surfaced in 2011.“Are you here at the behest of Michael Cohen?” CNN correspondent Sara Sidner asked during Davidson’s early April sitdown.“No, no. No,” Davidson chuckled, shaking his head and smiling awkwardly. “Not in any way, shape or form.”Davidson may not be chuckling for long, after a run-in with the feds last week.On Friday, Davidson revealed he’s cooperating in the criminal probe of Cohen’s business dealings, led by federal prosecutors in New York. Just one week before, the FBI raided Cohen’s office, home, and hotel room for records related to, among other things, Cohen’s payoff to Daniels in the home stretch of the election.“I am very confident that Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson and others will have to account for the things that they have done.”— Peter Stris, counsel for Karen McDougalDavidson provided “certain limited electronic information” to the Cohen inquiry, said his spokesman Dave Wedge. “He has done so and will continue to cooperate to the fullest extent possible under the law,” Wedge said in a statement sent to multiple media outlets, including The Daily Beast.The news follows reports that the FBI seized recordings Cohen made of his phone conversations with Davidson. During one call, “Cohen was being unusually simplistic, like he had bullet points that he was reading from to try and make himself look good,” a source told CNN. “He was trying to clarify the timeline of the agreements made with Davidson in his favor.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Davidson didn’t consent to the recordings and “will pursue all his legal rights under the law” if they do exist, Wedge warned.Cohen did not respond by press time to requests for comment about his relationship with Davidson, which has come under scrutiny in recent weeks.Indeed, Daniels and McDougal both fired Davidson and filed lawsuits to invalidate the hush contracts that he helped to negotiate. In a now-settled lawsuit, McDougal accused Davidson of conspiring with Cohen behind her back as she worked out her $150,000 agreement with the Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc. (AMI).AMI has released McDougal from her contract in a settlement that frees her to dish about Trump—and to possibly pursue Davidson and Cohen in court. “For the avoidance of doubt, neither Keith Davidson nor Michael Cohen is an AMI Released Party,” the settlement states, adding that McDougal isn’t barred from making claims against the men.McDougal’s counsel, Peter Stris, suggested legal action against Davidson was on the table. During an appearance on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, Stris wasted no time linking him to Cohen and accusing the pair of committing legal fraud.“The reason people like Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson are creating all of this mischief is because they’re not faithfully representing people,” Stris told Maddow, adding, “We see this pattern of powerful men—and it often happens to be the same ones here, Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson—doing these deals.“I am very confident that Michael Cohen and Keith Davidson and others will have to account for the things that they have done,” Stris said. Stris is representing a third woman once represented by Davidson: Shera Bechard. The former Playboy model and actress was at the center of another hush agreement negotiated between Davidson and Cohen in late 2017 and for which she received $1.6 million.Cohen’s client, Republican donor Elliott Broidy, a vice chairman on Trump’s inaugural committee, allegedly paid Bechard for sex and impregnated her. Broidy said Bechard did not go through with the pregnancy. According to The Wall Street Journal, Cohen facilitated the quarterly payments to Bechard on Broidy’s behalf. Stris, on Twitter, said Bechard was “deeply distressed” that her confidential agreement with Broidy was leaked to the press and accused Cohen and Davidson of “profoundly disturbing and repeated collusion.” For his part, Broidy said Cohen “reached out to me after being contacted by this woman’s attorney, Keith Davidson.” Broidy hired Cohen, he said, after Cohen “informed me about his prior relationship with Mr. Davidson.”Cohen even used the same aliases for Bechard’s contract as he did with the infamous Daniels NDA: “David Dennison” and “Peggy Peterson,” the Journal reported.Meanwhile, Cohen referred another Trump ally to Davidson. Chuck LaBella, a former producer on The Apprentice, enlisted Davidson over a dispute with actor Tom Arnold, who on Twitter accused LaBella of having damaging intel on Trump. Davidson told CNN he wasn’t paid for sending an email to Arnold’s attorney, asking that the actor stop implying LaBella was a witness to any misconduct. In a statement to The Daily Beast, Wedge acknowledged Davidson and Cohen have a history of hammering out deals. “Attorney Davidson has represented a few clients referred to him from a variety of different sources in which opposing counsel was Michael Cohen,” Wedge said in a statement. “He is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyers Attorney Davidson has dealt with over his 18 years as a lawyer. “Their relationship is purely professional and they have met in person only a couple of times in professional settings,” Wedge continued. Responding to Stris’ allegations, Wedge said Davidson “dispute[s] many of the descriptions of these situations by media and others, and strenuously denies any insinuations of unethical or inappropriate behavior.”“In these matters, and in all of his cases, Attorney Davidson has always advocated strongly for his clients’ best interests,” Wedge stated.Keith Davidson has made a career of selling—or trying to sell—sex tapes and other dirt back to celebrities, who’ve ponied up to prevent Davidson’s clients from releasing their mortifying secrets to the media.Called “the ‘Better Call Saul’ of D-list celebrities,” Davidson represented a woman soliciting cash for a sex tape of Austin Powers actor Verne Troyer. He also tried to profit off a sex tape of reality TV star Tila Tequila, who sued him.The Smoking Gun reported Davidson beefed up his client rolodex of Hollywood hangers-on with the help of TMZ co-founder Mike Walters. Walters and TMZ employees enjoyed Davidson’s legal services in return, according to the report. One hot tip Walters allegedly delivered to Davidson was the Hulk Hogan sex tape. TMZ first reported about the tape’s existence in March 2012. Five months later, Davidson emailed Hogan’s lawyer, David Houston, saying he represented the “rights holder of the footage.” Over the phone, Davidson told Houston that the first sex tape received by Gawker was “a warning shot” and that Hogan should pay up or risk “increasing problems,” according to Houston’s deposition in a lawsuit filed by the wrestler.Davidson has declined to comment on the Hogan case, and Walters doesn’t appear to have denied any involvement with the sex-tape imbroglio. According to court filings in the Gawker lawsuit, Walters had a personal relationship with Hogan, whose son worked with Walters’ father on a business venture. (Houston said he was shocked to learn Walters, a source of intel for Hogan’s camp, was the middleman between the leaker and Davidson, The Smoking Gun reported.)In a second call, Davidson again inquired whether Hogan “would pay him” and warned there was “more than one” tape, court filings allege. Houston contacted the FBI, which set up a sting operation at a hotel in Clearwater Beach, Florida, targeting Davidson, who was suspected of extortion but never charged.At the hotel, Davidson’s team handed over what they claimed were all copies of the Hogan recordings in exchange for a $150,000 check and the promise of $150,000 more. When Houston handed Davidson and a go-between the money, FBI agents stormed in with guns drawn, arresting the duo, states a lawsuit filed by Hogan under his real name, Terry Bollea, in May 2016.“The 47-year-old sleaze-chaser was in touch with Cohen as early as 2011, when a gossip site published details about Daniels’ alleged romp with Trump.”Federal prosecutors declined to file charges against Davidson, though it’s unclear why. According to The Smoking Gun, Houston argued the government “had more than ample evidence” to prosecute.Davidson’s law license has been suspended twice since 2010, California Bar records show. The first time, Davidson was accused of misconduct in cases, including his failure to appear at a hearing and case management conference in a medical malpractice suit. He was suspended a second time for failing to pay bar membership fees. The 47-year-old sleaze-chaser was in touch with Cohen as early as 2011, when a gossip site published details about Daniels’ alleged romp with Trump. In his recent CNN interview, Davidson said he called Cohen after Daniels asked him to demand the website, The Dirty, remove the story about the alleged affair.Daniels was connected to Davidson through her former manager, Gina Rodriguez, according to an October 2016 Smoking Gun report. Davidson told the site that Rodriguez, a former adult actress who’s represented Michael Lohan and “Octomom” Nadya Suleman, has referred him multiple clients over the years.Nik Richie, founder of The Dirty, claims Rodriguez came to him to break the Daniels-Trump story, and that Daniels emailed him the salacious details in October 2011. But when Rodriguez secured a paid interview with In Touch magazine (which never ran), she hired Davidson to press The Dirty to remove its exclusive story “because she was shaking down Donald Trump,” Richie wrote on his site.Aside from Rodriguez, Davidson appears to have other connections to the gossip blog. Karen McDougal’s ex-husband, James Grdina, invested in the website. And Grdina’s brother, Jay, had previously retained Davidson for his hangover-prevention drink company, SEC filings show.Richie claims that Davidson sent his site a cease-and-desist letter, but that Cohen was involved behind the scenes and “negotiated directly with Stormy Daniels’ attorney.”“Cohen would call Davidson weeks later—after hearing rumors that Stormy Daniels was getting interest in her story from media outlets.”In the CNN special, Sidner asked Davidson what his initial conversation with Cohen was like.“Well, I think there’s a lot of chest pounding,” Davidson answered. “To the best of my recollection, it was a lot of, you know, ‘How dare you’ and, you know, ‘We’ll chase you to the ends of the earth,’ and ‘This is not a true story’ and, you know, ‘We’re going to come and get you.’”Davidson recalls telling Cohen to calm down. “I said, ‘Whoa. Hold on. Hold your horses’ and ‘That’s not at all the reason for our calling.’ And we said that Ms. Daniels does not want the story out and we’re going to do our best to take that,” Davidson said. The opposing lawyers lost contact until summer of 2016, Davidson claims, when McDougal retained him to sell her story.Davidson claimed he phoned Cohen as a “professional courtesy” and informed him a matter that “may or may not have involved his client” was resolved. Dylan Howard, a senior AMI executive, interviewed McDougal in Los Angeles about her 10-month tryst with Trump. But after the hours-long meeting, Davidson informed McDougal that the company wasn’t interested in buying her story. Yet Davidson never mentioned that “he and AMI updated Mr. Trump’s representatives about Ms. McDougal” following this interview, her complaint alleged. AMI renewed interest in McDougal’s story after she began talks to spill the beans with ABC News. In early August, Davidson sent McDougal an AMI contract and allegedly rushed her into signing it, she says. Then Davidson allegedly emailed Cohen, who was not a party to the legal matter, requesting a phone call.“He then told Mr. Cohen on the phone that the deal was done—Ms. McDougal had been silenced,” her lawsuit said.When asked about the supposed call, Cohen told The New York Times, “I don’t recall those communications.” The Times reported the men regularly communicated, however, via phone, text, and email after McDougal’s contract was signed.Cohen would call Davidson weeks later—after hearing rumors that Stormy Daniels was getting interest in her story from media outlets. “I called Mr. Davidson and asked if this was true. He told me that he would find out,” Cohen told Vanity Fair last month. (Davidson himself confirmed this during his CNN interview.)The Trump stalwart then asked if Daniels had a price in mind, and Davidson allegedly replied with the $130,000 figure. “He said that she needed the money,” Cohen recalled. “I didn’t come up with this number.” Daniels signed her NDA with Cohen in late October 2016, and he wired the hush money to a client-trust account for Davidson, the Journal reported.Davidson has mostly kept quiet about his role in Daniels’ payout, which was exposed by the Journal in January, and the McDougal contract.One month later, Davidson suggested to a New York magazine scribe working on a profile about him that they should contact his legal opponents for comment. His first suggestion for comment was Michael Cohen, who called him “a true gentleman.”“Keith Davidson… is a tireless advocate for his clients,” Cohen told the reporter in an email. “In each and every interaction I’ve ever had with him, he has always been professional, ethical and a true gentleman.”Davidson, during his CNN interview, said he met with Cohen at least once this year. In their last conversation, Cohen called and told Davidson he believed Daniels and McDougal waived their attorney-client privilege by speaking to the media. Asked why he agreed to go on TV, Davidson said, “I’d like the truth to come out. To the extent that I can assist in that endeavor, that’s really why I’m here.”“Is the whole truth out yet?” Sidner asked. “I don’t believe so,” Davidson concluded. “I think most of it. Not the whole truth.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Might Pardon Jack Johnson. Why Didn’t Obama?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s unexpected announcement that he is mulling the pardon of legendary boxer Jack Johnson raises the obvious question: Why didn’t Barack Obama do it first? After all, lawmakers and civil rights advocates have argued for years that Johnson’s conviction for violating the Mann Act was a clear example of a racist application of the law. Johnson’s real crime wasn’t the trafficking of women, it was dating white ones in an age when it was socially unacceptable for a black man to do so. The campaign to grant Johnson a pardon began back in 2004 with high profile supporters, like Sens. Harry Reid (D-NV) and John McCain (R-AZ). But it really gained steam early in the Obama years, when the resolution passed through Congress in 2009. And yet, Obama never acted, neither then, nor when the pardon push reemerged in 2013, nor during his last year in office when it re-emerged once more. “It befuddled all of us,” said one congressional aide involved in the push. “We couldn’t for the life of us understand why he didn’t do anything or the administration didn’t.”So what gives? Gavin Parke, a former senior leadership staffer for Reid, said that his early impression was Obama didn’t want to act on Johnson out of political discomfort. “[R]eading between the lines,” he emailed The Daily Beast, “our conjecture was that they didn’t want to engage in divisive racial issues that were largely symbolic.” But the main reason that Obama held back, Parke added, was out of a rigid dedication to preserving norms. “The Obama White House was stringently opposed to the pardons process becoming politicized in any way. They felt so strongly about that, it may have extended even to posthumous pardons.” Such a position seems, as one Obama veteran conceded, “quaint” in the Trump years. But it was a thing. As one senior official, who asked to speak on background not to characterize the president’s thinking, put it: “President Obama relied on the Department of Justice to make recommendations and it is against DOJ’s general policy to accept posthumous pardons.”The general policy of the Department of Justice is, indeed, to not “accept for processing applications for posthumous pardons for federal convictions,” out of “belief that the time of the officials involved in the clemency process is better spent on the pardon and commutation requests of living persons.” And, indeed, when it formally weighed in on the Johnson matter in 2009, the DoJ specifically declined to make an exemption to that rule.But the department did note that it was in Obama’s power to grant a pardon should he choose to do so. For that reason, another senior Obama official—who, for the same reasons, spoke on condition of anonymity—told The Daily Beast: “I doubt the issue was the posthumous granting.” Other presidents, after all, have granted pardons to the dead, though admittedly rarely. As McClatchy reported, Bill Clinton granted one for Lt. Henry O. Flipper, the Army’s first African-American graduate of West Point, while Bush pardoned Charles Winters, an American businessman who transferred two B-17 aircraft to Israel. When he was pressed on the matter in 2016, former Attorney General Eric Holder conceded that posthumous pardons are, in fact, given; but that they “are very rarely done.” He then offered a slightly more nuanced explanation as to why Obama never offered Johnson a pardon; mainly, that while Johnson was clearly a victim of racism, he also had some flaws. “Jack Johnson,” said the man who’d been the nation’s top legal authority from 2007 to 2015, “no question was convicted unfairly. That might be a historical injustice that might need to be rethought.”However, he added, “there are on the other side, countervailing concerns about the way [Johnson] treated women, physically treated women. So all of this has to be balanced before this president or his successor would make a determination that a pardon is appropriate.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Holder’s statement came toward the tail end of the Obama presidency, when Johnson’s advocates were making one last effort to convince the administration to act. By that point, the administration was making a full-on blitz to direct the presidential pardon and commutation powers toward those who were both still alive and enduring lengthy sentences for small-time drug offenses. Trump has dropped that push entirely and used his pardon power sparingly. The first person he pardoned was disgraced ex-Sheriff Joe Arpaio. And it was reportedly done without going through the formal processes and channels that defined the Obama-era approach. When he announced that he was considering a full pardon for Johnson, Trump also revealed who gave him the idea to do so. It wasn’t McCain, who remains at home in Arizona, battling brain cancer. It was the actor, Sylvester Stallone. "},
 {'title': 'Trump ‘Pee Tape’ Could Be Real, Says Ex FBI Director James Comey',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "We regret to inform you that James Comey, the former director of the FBI, says it’s “possible” that a pee tape involving Donald Trump and Russian prostitutes actually exists.The most infamous section of the Steele dossier, which was full of salacious claims involving Trump and Russia, included a totally unverified claim that the now-president paid prostitutes in 2013 to pee on a Moscow hotel bed where Barack and Michelle Obama once slept.In his new book, Comey revealed Trump asked him to investigate the claim that any such video existed in order to prove that it wasn’t true. In an interview Friday on Good Morning America, Comey said for the first time that the near-mythical tape could really exist.“I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013,” said Comey, in one of the most extraordinary sentences ever broadcast on breakfast television. “It’s possible, but I don’t know.”Elsewhere in the interview, broadcast ahead of the April 17 release of his book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership, Comey told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos that he discussed the allegations with Trump on more than one occasion—experiences which he justifiably described “really weird.”Comey said that during a private dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, the president brought up the dossier and said that “he may want me to investigate it to prove that it didn’t happen. And then he says something that distracted me because he said, you know, ‘If there’s even a 1 percent chance my wife thinks that’s true, that’s terrible.’”The former FBI director added: “And I remember thinking, ‘How could your wife think there’s a 1 percent chance you were with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow?’ I’m a flawed human being, but there is literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true. So, what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think [that] there’s only a 99 percent chance you didn’t do that?”Comey advised Trump that it would be unhelpful to start an investigation into the prostitute allegations as it might lend weight to them and also because it would be nearly impossible to prove once and for all that it didn’t happen.The former FBI director recounted a separate private meeting with Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, at Trump Tower, where he first told Trump about the contents of the dossier in a surreal one-on-one conversation. The president appeared concerned about how the dossier may undermine his election victory and asked Comey to confirm it had no impact on the election.Comey recalled thinking ahead of the tricky conversation: “I’m about to meet with a person who doesn’t know me, who’s just been elected president of the United States, [and] by all accounts, and from my watching him during the campaign, could be volatile. And I’m about to talk to him about allegations that he was involved with prostitutes in Moscow and that the Russians taped it and have leverage over him.”He described the sensitive conversation as an “almost out-of-body experience, adding: “I was floating above myself, looking down, saying, ‘you’re sitting here, briefing the incoming president of the United States about prostitutes in Moscow.’”He went on: “I started to tell him about—the allegation was that he had been involved with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow in 2013 during the visit for the Miss Universe pageant and that the Russians had filmed the episode, and he interrupted very defensively and started talking about it, you know, ‘Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?’” Comey recalled.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“And I assumed he was asking that rhetorically, I didn’t answer that, and I just moved on and explained, ‘Sir, I’m not saying that we credit this, I’m not saying we believe it. We just thought it very important that you know.’”Comey said he told the president he had no idea if the allegations were true, saying: “I said … ‘I’m not saying that I believe the allegations, I’m not saying that I credit it… I never said, ‘I don’t believe it,’ because I couldn’t say one way or another.”Speaking after his interview aired on Good Morning America, ending with Comey saying it’s “possible” the Russian pee tape exists, ABC’s Stephanopoulos said: “I gotta say, that took my breath away.”If the supposed prostitute tape really was recorded by the Russians, it would give Russian President Vladimir Putin a powerful means of influence over Trump, potentially leaving open the ability to blackmail or attempt to bend the president of the United States to Russia’s will.The Steele dossier, put together by a former British intelligence officer, contains multiple allegations of misconduct and conspiracy between Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government. The section including the “pee tape” allegations included other examples of so-called kompromat—or compromising information—including alleged bribery and other sexual acts involving prostitutes. Some of the allegations in the document have been verified, but large parts have either been disproved or are yet to be proved.Elsewhere in the book, The Washington Post reported Thursday, Comey writes that Trump told him during a January 2017 White House meeting that the pee-tape allegation “couldn’t be true” because he didn’t stay at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton overnight and “only used the hotel room to change his clothes.”“I decided not to tell him that the activity alleged did not seem to  require either an overnight stay or even being in proximity to the  participants,” Comey writes, according to the Post.However, as The Atlantic’s Natasha Bertrand pointed out early Friday, NBC News reported in November that Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller told a congressional panel that a Russian wanted to send prostitutes to the room, but that Trump declined the offer and went to bed alone at the Moscow hotel. “One source noted that Schiller testified he eventually left Trump’s hotel room door and could not say for sure what happened during the remainder of the night,” the report stated.Trump hasn’t responded to the substance of the claims by Comey, but he questioned his integrity in a Twitter outburst against him shortly after the interview was aired Friday morning, saying: “James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst ‘botch jobs’ of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!”"},
 {'title': 'President Trump Issues Memo Banning Most Transgender Servicemembers',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "On Friday night, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum seeking to ban nearly all transgender Americans from serving in the U.S. military, a move that the White House said would “enhance our military’s readiness, lethality, and effectiveness.”The president’s actions on Friday follow through with a tweet, sent in July 2017, declaring that he would no longer allow “transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.”The memo, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle and released shortly after President Trump landed for a weekend vacation in Palm Beach, Florida, declared that “the accession or retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria—those who may require substantial medical treatment, including through medical drugs or surgery—presents considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality.”The memo did not say what would happen to the thousands of transgender troops estimated to currently serve in the military, although the president did cite the recommendations of Secretary of Defense James Mattis. In February, Mattis issued a report on transgender troops, citing his own “personal judgment,” calling on the Pentagon to bar almost all transgender troops from military service, with a few narrow caveats.“I firmly believe that compelling behavioral health reasons require the Department to proceed with caution before compounding the significant challenges inherent in treating gender dysphoria with the unique, highly stressful circumstances of military training and combat operations,” Mattis said. “Preservation of unit cohesion, absolutely essential to military effectiveness and lethality, also reaffirms this conclusion.”Therefore, Mattis continued, the Department of Defense should view all transgender people with “a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria” as disqualified from military service, unless they have been “stable” in their “biological sex” for 36 months prior to accession into the military, or are willing to be deployed without “a change of gender.”Currently serving transgender individuals, Mattis recommended, “may continue to serve in their preferred gender and receive medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria.”Transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition, Mattis concluded, “are disqualified from military service.”LGBTQ groups immediatey condemned the president’s decision, dubbing the memorandum “transphobia masquerading as policy.”“This policy is not based on an evaluation of new evidence,” Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project, said in a statement. “It is reverse-engineered for the sole purpose of carrying out President Trump’s reckless and unconstitutional ban, undermining the ability of transgender service members to serve openly and military readiness as a whole.”Peter Renn, a senior attorney with LGBTQ legal advocacy group Lambda Legal, dismissed the plan as “nothing more than a transparent ruse cobbled together with spittle and duct tape designed solely to try to mask discrimination.”“A plan to implement an unconstitutional decree,” Renn continued, “is an unconstitutional plan.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The Rand Corporation released a study, commissioned by the Pentagon, evaluating the potential effects transgender troops would have on unit cohesion, military readiness, and the overall military budget.That study found that medical treatments for trans servicemembers would cost the military between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually.By comparison, the Department of Defense spent $84.24 million on erectile dysfunction prescriptions in 2014."},
 {'title': 'Giuliani: Michael Cohen Might Have Made Other Hush-Money Payments for Trump',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R), one of President Donald Trump’s top attorneys for the special counsel’s investigation, suggested on Sunday that the president’s longtime attorney Michael Cohen might have made hush-money payments on behalf of Trump that were similar to the $130,000 wired to porn star Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 presidential election.“The agreement with Michael Cohen, as far as I know, is a longstanding agreement that Michael Cohen takes care of situations like this, then gets paid for them sometimes,” Giuliani said on ABC’s This Week.“There were other things involved that had nothing to do with Stormy Daniels,” Giuliani added. “In other words, other amounts of money.\xa0This was not uncommon for him to do that.”Last week, Giuliani appeared to contradict Trump’s account about when the president became aware that Cohen made the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Appearing with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Giuliani said Trump reimbursed Cohen “over a period of several months.” But on April 5, Trump denied that he had any knowledge of the payment.Giuliani—whose media appearances last week set the White House scrambling—said that if he were Cohen at the time the payment to Daniels was arranged in October 2016, he would have kept it from the president so as to not “bother him two weeks before the election with this thing.” He also said the payment did not amount to an illegal campaign contribution, but rather was intended “to protect [Trump], to protect his family.”Cohen, who is under criminal investigation for alleged “acts of concealment” and “fraud,” is no longer representing the president, Giuliani said. But the previous arrangement between the two men might have led to other payouts, the former mayor and federal prosecutor said.“I would think if it was necessary, yes. He made payments for the president or he’s conducted business for the president,” he said. “Which means he had legal fees, monies laid out and expenditures, which I have on my bills to my clients.”The president’s legal team expects Cohen to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to Giuliani, who said, “I don’t think they’ll be happy with it because he doesn’t have any incriminating evidence about the president or himself.”'},
 {'title': 'Keith Ellison Is Seriously Considering a Run for Attorney General in Minnesota',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'On Tuesday, the House of Representatives could lose one of its most progressive members and the Democratic National Committee might be without a deputy chairman. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) is considering running for attorney general in Minnesota, multiple sources close to the congressman told The Daily Beast. “I will make a decision tomorrow because it’s the filing deadline,” Ellison told Politico on Monday evening after the rumor of the move spread throughout the day. A source directly familiar with the deliberations told The Daily Beast after the article was posted that there had been no final decision yet. “It is being seriously looked at,” said the source, requesting to speak on background about the discussions. Ellison had previously filed to run again in his district but can make a decision to jump into the attorney general race by Tuesday. Should Ellison choose to run for AG, it would spark a major shakeup at the DNC, where he is often seen as a direct line to the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party. It would also be yet another political shift in a state that has had a number of them in recent memory. On Saturday, Attorney General Lori Swanson failed to get the endorsement of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. After that, she withdrew and the convention endorsed Matt Pelikan, a Minneapolis attorney and activist. Swanson turned around on Monday and decided to run for governor instead, with retiring Rep. Rick Nolan as her running mate. That’s when Ellison came in.“I haven’t talked to him but heard he is very interested,” another source told The Daily Beast. “I do know if he runs it could be a big boost to the statewide ticket because he will mobilize progressives with his race and an open seat in his progressive Minneapolis district will also increase turnout.”This is not the first time Ellison has considered a run at the attorney general position.

 {'title': 'Comey Memos: Trump Said Flynn ‘Has Serious Judgment Issues’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In May 2017, President Donald Trump declared that “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!”One year later, no such tapes have materialized, but the American public has just been given access to the next best thing: 15 thorough pages of contemporaneous notes, taken by Comey in order to document his increasingly fractious encounters with Trump.The Department of Justice delivered Comey’s memos to relevant congressional committees on Thursday, after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-SC), and Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) demanded their release, with Goodlatte going so far as to draft a subpoena to obtain them.After consulting with “relevant parties,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said in a statement, the Department of Justice “concluded that the release of the memoranda to Congress at this time would not adversely impact any ongoing investigation.”The seven memos, written between January and April 2017, largely comport with Comey’s public statements detailing his tumultuous relationship with Trump—that he found the president obsessed with personal loyalty, frequently preoccupied with allegations of sexual impropriety lodged against him during the presidential campaign, and a habitual liar.In the second memo, for example, written after a dinner for two in the Green Room of the White House, Comey noted that Trump told him that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus had no idea Comey was dining with him, before moments later telling him that Priebus did, in fact, know he was there. In their final conversation before Comey’s unceremonious firing, Comey wrote that Trump told him that “I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.”The memos do, however, appear to shed new light on how the nation’s top law enforcement official attempted to navigate interactions with a White House largely staffed—and helmed—by people unfamiliar with the day-to-day functioning of American government.During that dinner, Comey noted, Trump said that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn “has serious judgment issues.” Flynn would resign from his position only weeks later, after press reports revealed undisclosed contacts with Russian officials, about which Flynn later lied during conversations with Vice President Mike Pence.Trump “illustrated” Flynn’s judgment issues, Comey wrote, by relaying the national security adviser’s fumbling of a congratulatory call from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who waited six days for Trump to return his message.“This isn’t [redacted nation] we are talking about,” Trump said, according to Comey, presumably referring to a world leader who could wait six days for the president to call him back.“In telling the story, the president pointed his fingers at his head and said ‘the guy has serious judgment issues,’” Comey wrote. “I did not comment at any point during this topic and there was no mention or acknowledgment of any FBI interest in or contact with General Flynn.”It wasn’t just Trump who breached traditional barriers between the White House and the FBI intended to maintain the bureau’s independence, Comey wrote. During his first one-on-one meeting with Priebus, Comey wrote that the White House chief of staff asked if Flynn was being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?” Priebus asked, in reference to warrants obtainable under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allow for surveillance warrants to be signed against foreign spies inside the United States. Comey “paused for a few seconds and then said that I would answer here, but that this illustrated the kind of question that had been asked and answered through established channels.”Comey’s response is redacted, although it was later revealed that Flynn was under FISA surveillance at some point.Trump repeatedly, and without prompting, discussed allegations of sexual impropriety, and occasionally requested that Comey and the FBI help “lift the cloud” by investigating some of them, according to Comey. During their first meeting, Comey wrote, Trump “started talking about all the women who had falsely accused him of grabbing or touching them (with particular mention of a ‘stripper’ who said he grabbed her) and gave me the sense that he was defending himself to me.”It is unclear to what the president was referring. There is no public record of a stripper accusing Trump of groping her.Trump’s obsession with what he called “the golden showers thing,” according to Comey’s notes, was constant during his meetings with the FBI director. During an Oval Office meeting with Comey and Priebus, Trump reiterated that the accusations were “nonsense,” but also declared that “Putin had told him ‘we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.’” Comey parenthetically noted that Trump “did not say when Putin had told him this and I don’t recall.”(Trump may have confused a remark Putin made in an interview with Bloomberg one month before with a private communication with the Russian president. In that interview, Putin said that while he found it “hard to believe” that Trump would need “to meet girls of loose morals… ours are undoubtedly the best in the world.”)In a statement, Goodlatte, Gowdy, and Nunes said the publication of the memos demonstrate that Comey’s scorched earth book tour pegged to the publication of his memoir, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, is born of sour grapes. “[Comey] was willing to work for someone he deemed morally unsuited for office, capable of lying, requiring of personal loyalty, worthy of impeachment, and sharing the traits of a mob boss,” the statement read. “Comey was willing to overlook all of the aforementioned characteristics in order to keep his job. In his eyes, the real crime was his own firing.”In an interview on Thursday afternoon, ahead of the memos’ release, Comey said he was happy for Congress to have access to his notes.“It’s fine by me,” Comey told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I don’t care. I don’t have any views on it. I’m totally fine with transparency.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump Does Trump, and Things Get Worse',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Amidst the numbing chaos that is the Trump administration, these past few days are worth reflecting on because three events have moved the needle in a bad direction.1. The hiring of John Bolton highlights Donald Trump’s instability, his total lack of any coherent worldview, and most of all—and most dangerously of all—his need to feel that no limits are being imposed on him. Here’s what I mean. When talking foreign policy, sometimes Trump sounds like Bolton, with all that overheated rhetoric he’s thrown at Kim Jong Un. But at other times, he’s an isolationist. At still other times, like when he’s agreeing to meet with Kim with no preconditions, he’s a Neville Chamberlain in the making. (By the way, is Lloyd’s of London taking odds yet on whether that summit will actually happen?)So if he wasn’t happy with H.R. McMaster and wanted new blood, he could have gone in any number of ways. That he chose the guy who will reinforce his worst instincts tells us, I think, that what he values most (aside from unquestioning loyalty) is someone who won’t hem him in; in other words, Trump may decide to launch a first strike against North Korea, or he may not. But if he does, by God, he doesn’t want some globalist ninny telling him not to. So the principle at work here is not hawkishness per se. It’s having someone who won’t tell him no.Remember how Fred Flintstone, when he was thinking of stealing the vacation money to buy a new bowling ball, would have a little angel and little devil pop up on each shoulder making their respective cases? Bolton is Trump’s little devil, and clearly, Trump wanted things that way.2. Trump’s slapstick handling of the budget shows us—again, but probably more than anything before it—just how massively in over his head he is in the job. As Michael Grunwald wrote in Politico last week, Trump just got rolled by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. They didn’t get their Dreamers request, but they got everything else, and Trump got very little. Thirty-three miles of border fence but no sanctuary cities defunding, no Planned Parenthood defunding, and not much else.Yes, it was congressional Republicans who cut these deals, not Trump. But Trump couldn’t cut them, or credibly refute cutting them, because he doesn’t know enough to do one or the other. He knows nothing about the ins and outs of the budget. And that ridiculous feint last Friday morning that he was going to veto it…\xa0He relented after a few people with some actual knowledge told him how suicidal that would be, let alone on his way out to another weekend at Mar a Lago. But it was embarrassing.3. The Stormy Daniels story was kind of non-newsy on certain levels. That Trump slept with a porn star and behaved crudely toward her is about the least shocking thing in the world. But the threats made against her are the real story here. That’s going to be the new iteration of this story, and depending on how it plays out it stands the chance of reminding the country of something that many have forgotten, or never knew: The president of the United States has mob ties.Here’s David Cay Johnston cataloguing a few of them, like how Trump went out of his way to use Mafia-controlled companies to pour the concrete for Trump Tower. The great Wayne Barrett was the master chronicler of all this, going back to the 1990s. All you need to know for now is that back in the day, the government of Australia denied him a permit to open a casino in Sydney because the government deemed him to be too mobbed up. Trump will say of this failure that he lost interest in Australia, but Australia also lost interest in him.We’re bound to see some more reporting about the nature of these threats that Daniels discussed on 60 Minutes Sunday night. What else do Daniels and that swashbuckling lawyer of hers have with regard to these threats? Is Robert Mueller maybe looking into who made them on Trump’s behalf? Is Mueller going to interview Michael Cohen one of these days? That might be Mueller’s best path to Trump. Depending on where this goes, Americans could learn some interesting things about the past associations of the man who now embodies our democratic republic.And now we hear that Trump may want to be his own chief of staff. Hey, why not? A president needs a chief of staff only when he relies on staff. When he does things like read, and look at evidence. Trump doesn’t need anyone. He has his TV. If they don’t say it on Fox & Friends, how important can it be, anyway?As we think back over these 14 months, we recall that the madness started literally on the first day, with the speech about “carnage” and the protests about his crowd size. And every week has brought jaw-dropping moments, too many to count.But this is different. Trump has spent a year-plus feeling that he was heeding the advice of these wise people in Washington (he wasn’t really, but in his mind he was), and it hasn’t made him happy. Now he’s finished with that.

 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Is Trump’s Newest Louise Linton',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Under Administrator Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency has shifted its focus from environmental stewardship to stalwart advocacy on behalf of the polluters it was created to regulate. But while Pruitt has taken the axe to the government agency in the name of draining the swamp of government regulation, there is one swamp that Pruitt seems hell-bent on protecting at all costs: the Washington milieu wherein a bureaucrat’s clout can be directly correlated to the number of taxpayer-funded bodyguards protecting his delicate constitution.Not since Louise Linton—the Real Housewife of the United States Treasury who swanned into America’s collective consciousness with an Instagram rant defending taxpayer-funded trips on military jets and her use of hashtags like #hermesscarf and #valentinorockstudheels—has a member of President Trump’s coterie so aggressively courted the perception that public service is a smashing opportunity for graft.But where Linton only used her spouse’s position to build her online brand and catch the occasional $33,000 solar eclipse, Pruitt has used his position at the top of an underfunded federal agency to enjoy trappings fit for a head of state.Documents obtained by The Daily Beast found that Pruitt spent roughly $105,000 on first-class airfare since taking over the EPA. When he wasn’t enjoying the complimentary mimosas and legroom of first-class airline cabins, Pruitt spent approximately $58,000 on private and military flights to speak in front of lobbying groups and make tight connections to Rome. Pruitt’s appetite for luxury air travel was so ravenous that aides briefly considered leasing a private jet for his use, The Washington Post reported, at a cost of roughly $100,000 per month. Federal regulations for bureaucrats flying the friendly skies stipulate that “government travelers are required to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business when making official travel arrangements,” which actually might explain Pruitt’s profligacy. During his tenure as Oklahoma’s attorney general, Pruitt commuted almost daily from his 5,500-square-foot residence in Tulsa to his offices in the state capital of Oklahoma City—a 200-mile round trip—at government expense.EPA security officials initially defended the airline expenditures as necessary for Pruitt’s protection, citing “profanities” yelled at him by strangers who may have heard about how much Pruitt’s airline tickets had cost them.The EPA administrator’s Sun King delusions have extended far beyond the Delta Sky Club, however. On terra firma, Pruitt ordered, at a cost of $43,000, the installation of a soundproof phone booth at EPA headquarters for his use, in addition to spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on anti-surveillance sweeps of his office. Pruitt has also requested a bulletproof vehicle and a 20-person protective detail, according to The New York Times, having apparently mistaken the position of EPA administrator for that of Beyoncé. His current retinue of bodyguards have traveled with him to his home in Tulsa, as well as to a family vacation to Disneyland.At least five EPA officials have reportedly been reassigned, demoted, or requested new jobs after they raised concerns about Pruitt’s spending and management style. Their concerns included Pruitt’s demand that his bodyguards use the lights and sirens equipped on his government sedan to beat D.C. traffic snarls on his way to dinner at Le Diplomate, a francophone Buca di Beppo popular with hungover D.C. gays and the kind of people who crane their necks to see whether Ivanka Trump ordered the moules frites or the trout amandine.After a public backlash comparing her to ill-fated French queens, Linton has been waging a charm offensive, acquiescing to a soft-focus Washingtonian profile that pondered whether society doyennes hadn’t been a little harsh in their condemnations.Pruitt, meanwhile, seeks the approval of only one man: his boss, who has reportedly floated promoting Pruitt to attorney general as recently as this week.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Don’t Mess With This Muslim From Texas—He Just Got Elected!',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Something truly wonderful happened in Texas on Saturday night. In between a rodeo championship in Fort Worth, a country music festival in Austin and people honky tonkin’ from Amarillo to San Antonio, history was being made in the mid-size city of Euless, Texas. In this north Texas city that boasts a population of a little over 50,000, the good people there elected the first minority ever to the Euless City Council. And not only that, the person they elected by a 37-vote margin was both a Muslim and a Pakistani immigrant by the name of Salman Bhojani. A Muslim immigrant winning an election in Trump’s America, where he’s made anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant bigotry a cornerstone of his campaign, is truly inspiring—especially in a red state like Texas. While\xa0Bhojani was subject to anti-Muslim attacks during the campaign, his win\xa0truly represents a victory of American values over Trump’s un-American views. But this wasn’t an easy win for Bhojani, who possesses all the qualifications of someone who should easily win a local race. He’s a Boy Scout leader, a family man, has served on the city’s parks board for four years and is a lawyer practicing in the area. If he were Christian and white, I bet the GOP would’ve loved to recruit Bhojani.But he’s not. Bhojani is a brown, Muslim Pakistani immigrant who came to America in 1999. And while the election was non-partisan, that didn’t stop a Republican state representative—who was not even a candidate in the race—from trying to gin up anti-Muslim animus. So there was Texas representative and Trump wannabe Jonathan Stickland doing his best to scare local voters about the dangers of a Muslim American seeking elected office.Stickland, a Tea Party darling (but of course!), warned in a Facebook post that Bhojani was a Muslim, adding that “His ideas for our community would scare a majority of our residents but he’s very sneaky in how he presents himself.” (Interestingly, Stickland uses “sneaky” which historically had been used to smear Jews but now is also used to demonize Muslims.) Stickland warned that if elected, Bhojani would make "massive changes" to their mid-size city, clearly playing on fears of changing demographics and anti-Muslim sentiment.“The response to Stickland’s anti-Muslim bigotry was swift, with local faith leaders uniting to denounce it.”While Stickland also slammed Bhojani for being a “lifelong Democrat who supports raising your taxes,” it was his Muslim faith that Stickland tried to use as a wedge issue just like his beloved Trump. So Stickland posted a video on Facebook of Bhojani in his volunteer work as a Scout leader at a 2017 Euless City council meeting. There, Bhojani presented an American flag and then recited a general prayer from the Quran to start the council meeting that spoke of being welcoming and tolerant of other faiths.Well, Stickland was appalled. “How dare any faith other than Christianity be invoked at government meetings?!” has long been a theme by the far righters who truly want to impose Christian sharia law. So Stickland stated in connection with the video that it was “thanks to Mr. Bhojani that the Koran was read for the first time at a city council meeting.”And bingo, there you have good, old-fashioned “dog whistle politics,” as Stickland was warning people that Bhojani is not like them. The response to Stickland’s anti-Muslim bigotry was swift, with local faith leaders uniting to denounce it. As one of the Christian ministers who joined in condemning Stickland’s “hateful rhetoric” stated: “We are committed to following Jesus better today than yesterday, thus loving God and loving our neighbors as ourselves. This means all of our neighbors, whether we look alike, think alike or believe alike.” Amen to that!Sadly, anti-Muslim hate is a big part of mainstream Republican politics. After all, Trump openly employed it with his call for a complete Muslim ban and by declaring that “Islam hates us.” That’s why it’s not surprising that in the current race to be the next governor of Michigan we’re seeing anti-Muslim bigotry being spewed by a Republican elected official against Democrat Abdul El-Sayed, a 33-year-old medical doctor who previously headed Detroit’s health department. The Michigan born El-Sayed is the living example of the American dream. The son of Egyptian immigrants, he was captain of his Michigan high school football team, played lacrosse at University of Michigan and went on to win a Rhodes scholarship and earn a medical degree from Columbia University. But as is the case with Bhojani, all many on the right see is that he’s a Muslim. So in the last few weeks El-Sayed has been smeared with lies by Michigan Republican state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, who is trying to use anti-Muslim bigotry to bolster his own failing run for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. Colbeck, offering zero evidence to support his vile attacks on El-Sayed, has claimed that the Democrat is part of the Muslim Brotherhood and is waging a “civilization jihad” to in essence take over America. Funny, you know who else uses the idea that any visible Muslim American is waging a “civilization jihad”?! Anti-Muslim bigots Frank Gaffney and Brigitte Gabriel, who are closely tied to Trump’s new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his new national security adviser, John Bolton.

 {'title': 'Dems’ Job Guarantee Isn’t Nearly as Easy as It Sounds',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "There has been a surge of interest in the last year in the idea of a government job guarantee. A number of economists associated with the Levy Institute at Bard College and University of Missouri at Kansas City have long pushed the idea. In recent months, several potential candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have publicly raised the idea, including senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, and of course Bernie Sanders, who has fully endorsed it. While the idea of guaranteeing a decent paying job to every worker who wants one is appealing, it is likely to prove a difficult lift in implementation. A guaranteed job would radically transform the labor market in a way that could put tens of millions of workers on the public payroll. This would almost certainly put many low-wage employers out of business and raise the costs to consumers of services like restaurants, haircuts, and house cleaning. It also effectively gives the government direct responsibility for allocating workers across regions.The basic issue is that the program is designed to guarantee all people decent pay through their work. The problem is that this guarantee will not only provide an opportunity to those currently unemployed or under-employed; it would provide a better option for tens of millions of workers who already have jobs.A key issue here is determining the number of people who might opt for this public program. That will depend on the wage rate. In the plan being pushed by the Levy Institute (politically, most closely associated with Sanders), the wage rate is $15 an hour. This is around the 25th percentile of the wage distribution, meaning that 25 percent of the workforce, or roughly 40 million workers, now gets less. The proposal also calls for health-care insurance equivalent to that received by federal employees. This would make the plan attractive to even more low-wage workers, most of whom do not get employer-provided health-care benefits. In addition, government jobs are likely to offer job security and protection against abuses by an employer, like sexual harassment, which is yet another reason why they may prove attractive to workers in the private sector. “A Federal Reserve Board committed to a 2.0 percent inflation target would send interest rates soaring in response to this rise.”Given the number of workers who currently are paid less than the $15 an hour proposed wage, plus health care benefits that are worth at least $4 an hour, it might be that 10 million workers would leave private sector jobs for a guaranteed federal job. \xa0And that’s a conservative estimate; it could quite possibly be more than 20 million. With 10 million or so unemployed and underemployed workers, we are likely talking about having at least 20 million people in the program and perhaps over 30 million. Currently the federal workforce, excluding the Postal Service. is 2.2 million, so this is increasing the number of workers employed by the federal government by a factor of at least ten. The proposal calls for the program to be administered at the state and local level. This also presents issues (many of these governments have serious corruption problems), but even using state and local employment as a denominator, we would still be talking about doubling current levels. It requires some serious faith in government to think that this sort of leap in employment levels can be well-managed if done in a short period of time. It doesn’t help that many of these workers will have little education and job experience. There is also the issue of what happens in the private sector. The opportunity to get a public-sector job, with health-care insurance, paying $15 an hour, effectively imposes a floor on wages in the private sector. If we say that 50 million people now earn less than this package (the median wage is around $23 an hour – 80 million workers earn less), and the average gap is $4 an hour, then the additional cost to matching this wage in the private sector will be roughly $350 billion a year (this calculation assumes 1750 hours per worker and 50 million workers). That sum comes to roughly 1.8 percent of GDP. There also has to be some spillover effect. Workers who had been earning $16 or $17 an hour will have to see some bump in pay when the pay for those at the bottom jumps to $15 from levels that are currently as low as $7.25 an hour. If 20 million workers are in the bump range, and they get an average pay increase of $2 an hour, that raises the cost by another $70 billion, putting the total at $420 billion, or 2.1 percent of GDP.And this brings us to inflation. As a first approximation, this 2.1 percent figure would be the impact on the level of prices, although it would be dampened by reduced profit margins and increases in productivity. In any case, a Federal Reserve Board committed to a 2.0 percent inflation target would send interest rates soaring in response to this rise.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But even if the Fed can be controlled, this rise in pay for those at the bottom will mean a reduction in living standards for those higher up. They will have to pay more for restaurants and haircuts, as well having their house cleaned and their lawn mowed. Most of us won’t shed any tears for the “hard to get good help” crowd, but if we haven’t taken steps to weaken their economic power—which won’t be easy because they are powerful—we can expect to see doctors, lawyers, and other high-end earners getting pay hikes to protect their living standards. This is a story of serious wage-price spiral, unless we introduce other measures.None of this means we should reject a job guarantee out of hand. We can start with a lower wage and limit the program to long-term unemployed, or in other ways restrict the size. But we should also look to measures to weaken the economic power of those at the top. It is government policies, like restricting the entrance of qualified foreign doctors and allowing pension funds that pay private equity partners to lose them money, not laws of economics, that gives us a situation where doctors get $260,000 a year, hedge fund boys over a million, and CEOs more than $20 million. Reversing these policies will open the door for much higher pay and living standards for those lower down the income ladder."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump’s legal team is bigger than it looks. Two sources familiar with the president’s team have told The Daily Beast that about half a dozen attorneys affiliated with a conservative non-profit have been helping Jay Sekulow represent the president. Since the departure of lawyer John Dowd, American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) head Jay Sekulow has become the lone public face of the president’s personal legal team. But he isn’t alone. Andrew Ekonomou, Mark Goldfeder, and Ben Sisney are among the attorneys who have helped him handle legal matters related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, The Daily Beast has learned. Jay Sekulow told The Daily Beast that everyone working for the president’s legal team is paid through his private law firm, the Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group. Ekonomou is in private practice in Atlanta. He was formerly an acting U.S. attorney and head of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Northern District of Georgia. He has worked with the ACLJ on their litigation but is not an employee of the organization. He also worked on an amicus brief defending Trump’s travel ban. Goldfeder is a lecturer at Emory University’s law school and has also worked alongside ACLJ. Sisney works for ACLJ as senior counsel for litigation and public policy, and former clerk to U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzel. Sisney signed the same amicus brief defending the travel ban that Ekonomou did. Politico previously reported  that these lawyers have assisted Sekulow. The Daily Beast reported last week that Trump’s legal team has worked out of ACLJ’s Washington D.C. offices. This all highlights the growing prominence of ACLJ, a 501(c)3 non-profit best known for litigation related to social conservative matters. The non-profit has represented abortion clinic protesters and pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, as well as people opposed to LGBT rights. And it’s currently suing the State Department for documents related to the Uranium One deal, a favorite hobby-horse of Hillary Clinton’s critics. '},

If you compare maps showing the county results of the 2012 presidential contest, the 2016 presidential race, and Dallet’s win over Michael Screnock, you’ll see that she won back the famous lost Obama-to-Trump voters—all of them and then some, in certain cases.A few examples. In Grant County, a rural county over near Minnesota, Barack Obama got 56 percent, Donald Trump 51 percent, and Dallet 55 percent. In north-central Lincoln County, Obama nipped Romney 49-48, Trump clobbered Hillary Clinton 57-37, and Dallet actually outperformed ’12 Obama a little, winning 51-49. In Door County—that scraggly arm that juts up into Lake Michigan above Green Bay, famous for its cherries—Obama won 53-46, Trump won 49-46, and Dallet clubbed Screnock 62-38. And in Winnebago County, home to Oshkosh, Obama won 51-47, Trump won 50-42, and Dallet romped 57-43.Trust me, I’m not plucking out the four out of 72 counties that make my case. This was the pattern across the state. There were of course deep red counties were Dallet didn’t perform well and navy blue counties where she romped, but in the counties that have swung back and forth, she mostly equaled or bettered Obama’s 2012 numbers and far outperformed Clinton.Republicans really ought to look at that and worry. She won in exactly the kinds of places Democrats need to win this fall to bring out the brooms: suburban and exurban counties with working-class white voters. The fact that she outperformed Obama in a number of these counties sure looks like a sign of something big to come in those kinds of counties in Wisconsin and in other states outside the South where Democrats can gain ground.When I last wrote about the midterms five weeks ago, it was on the heels of two special elections won by Democrats in New England districts that were basically Republican. If anything, Dallet’s win is even stronger evidence of a building wave. This isn’t New England—this is Wisconsin, where Democratic luck lately has been uniformly bad. And she won as a liberal by 12 points. So the indicators are looking way up—except for the indicators that aren’t. The main one of those is the famous generic ballot. Take a look. This goes all over the place. The Democrats are always ahead, which is to be expected when a Republican president has a low approval rating, but it jumps from about six to 14 points. And in general, the Democratic lead has gone down in the last month by about four points.At the same time, Trump’s approval rating spikes and dives, too. This one is even harder to track. If you follow the POTUS Twitter feed, you’ve read that thanks to Rasmussen, Trump is at 50 percent. Right. And Laura Ingraham is more popular than David Hogg. In the real world, though, Trump is much closer to 40. Mind you even 40 is completely mystifying. I can see 30 percent of the country loving Trump, maybe a third. The remaining 7 to 10 percent truly vex me. My best guess: They’re basically apolitical people who don’t find Trump appealing but also don’t find him especially repulsive, and are with him as long as the economy is strong and they’re doing fine. I want to shake these people, even more than the MAGAheads. What is the matter with you? Can’t you see that this man is gross and dishonest and corrupt and would sooner take a piss on the Constitution than try to read it? Is your own economic situation really the only thing that matters to you?These people probably won’t vote in the midterms in large numbers—if all politics means to them is how it affects them personally, their ideological commitments are very shallow. But they matter anyway, because they’re keeping Trump within striking distance of somehow treading water on approval rating, and presidential approval rating is historically the most important indicator of how the midterm election will play out.It’s possible, between now and November, that Trump’s numbers could improve, if the economy holds out. Jobs numbers are due out this morning. The smart people are expecting a number around 200,000 again, or more. Seven more months of that combined with no World War III and a little luck on the Mueller front could well have Trump at 46-46, or more realistically 44-48.That is Trump’s best-case scenario. Then there are the worse scenarios. Those might not include recession or war, but they likely include more corruption (EPA chief Scott Pruitt is just one of several Trump agency heads who would be gone in any other administration), more unstable, non-genius-y behavior by the chief executive, and more revelations from Mueller. Who for example is George Nader? If you don’t yet know that name, you may want to familiarize yourself.No—the odds are very slim that Trump is going to get any more popular between now and November. But the odds are also slim that he’ll drop down to 30, unless Mueller delivers some bombshell. So he’ll probably still be around 40.

And he will turn the midterms into a total culture war, worse even than the 2016 election. It’s the only thing he’s ever done with any success. It’s how he won, or “won,” and it’s the only mode he knows.Democrats are going to have to be ready for this. But the track record so far is pretty hopeful. Roy Moore wanted a culture war. So did Screnock in his way, endorsing an ad by an independent group that tried to peg Dallet as soft on child molesters and that the victim’s family asked to be pulled off the air. That’s how it’s going to be all fall, all across the country. But it’s starting to look like Trump can only sell snake oil once, and America, or enough of it, is coming to its senses."},
 {'title': 'Justice Neil Gorsuch Gives Immigrants Big Win Against Trump’s Deportation Machine',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Supreme Court delivered a win for immigrants battling the Trump administration, with the justice Trump put on the high court, Neil Gorsuch, providing the margin of victory.The case, Sessions v. Dimaya, will immediately impact thousands of immigrants who are here legally but have committed crimes that trigger deportation. It also illustrates how judicial “originalism” like Gorsuch’s can lead to functionally liberal results.Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), any non-citizen who commits a “crime of violence” forfeits their right to remain in the country, regardless of their immigration status, how long they’ve lived here, and whether they have family here as well. Indeed, the INA makes their deportation mandatory. Such immigrants were often considered low-priority by the Bush and Obama administrations. Yes, they were technically supposed to be deported, but if they were here legally and didn’t have a serious criminal record, they’d be de-prioritized by the INS (now ICE). Since January, 2017, however, thousands have been caught up in ICE’s dragnet, with millions more at risk. The examples have been heart-rending. Thousands of Vietnamese refugees who came here in 1975 after helping America in the Vietnam War, are now set to be deported for relatively minor criminal infractions. An HIV-positive asylee is being deported to Venezuela, where HIV medication is unavailable, because of a minor drug infraction—effectively a death sentence. A father and grandfather who has lived in the United States for 40 years is arrested because of a 1996 marijuana offense, and is now rotting in detention. These are all people who came here legally, but whose criminal acts have triggered mandatory deportation.Today, that ends. In a 5-4 decision, with Justice Gorsuch joining the Court’s liberals, the Supreme Court held that this part of the INA is unconstitutionally vague. Because it never defined what a “crime of violence” is, courts had to figure out how to do so themselves. And, the Court said today, the way they did so – grouping crimes into categories and determining which categories were typically violent – is so vague that it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Nor can courts decide on a case-by-case basis, the Court noted, because that, too, deprives defendants of due process. Part of due process means having an orderly system of justice, with penalties clear in advance.The decision is yet another in a long line of defeats (with some exceptions) for the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. Courts have sharply limited the government’s anti-Muslim travel ban, refused to rubber-stamp its rollback of DACA, and rejected Trump’s attempt to target sanctuary cities.Does this mean that Gorsuch has gone soft, and is now a bleeding-heart liberal moved by the plight of immigrants?Not at all. On the contrary, in a concurring opinion, he reaffirmed his philosophy of “originalism” with a strong dose of libertarianism as well. “Vague laws invite arbitrary power,” the opinion begins. It proceeds to give a Scalia-like history lesson about the background to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.“Vague laws invite arbitrary power.”— Justice Neil GorsuchIndeed, the whole case is, in a sense, a testament to Justice Antonin Scalia’s legacy. The Court’s opinion, written by Justice Elena Kagan, relies heavily on Scalia’s opinion in a 2015 case that invalidated part of the federal “Three Strikes and You’re Out” law for identical reasons: part of the law was so vague that it violated the Due Process Clause.Contesting that legacy today was Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote that the vagueness doctrine is, itself, a judicial invention not found in the text of the Constitution. In a sense, Gorsuch and Thomas are debating who’s the real originalist, who’s the heir to the late Scalia. On one side, Thomas is clearly correct that the word “vagueness” is not in the Constitution. On the other, Gorsuch devotes eight pages to musty, old sources showing that the Founders considered specificity and fair notice to be intrinsic to the meaning of due process.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Ultimately, Gorsuch found enough common cause with the civil-libertarian wing of the Court to join in the result. Kagan’s opinion is clearly written more narrowly than it might otherwise have been, relying entirely on Johnson and refraining from comments about the fundamental injustice of the INA’s deportation scheme. There’s no bleeding-heart rhetoric to be found.Conversely, none of the liberals joined in Gorsuch’s history lecture. For them, the unfairness of the vague deportation trigger is manifestly in violation of due process, regardless of what Blackstone wrote in 1769. And, to be sure, the conservative justices have ample citations of their own, which is one reason “originalism” is not taken seriously by the vast majority of legal scholars. Give me a position, and I’ll find an “original” source that supports it.But originalism is taken very seriously by conservatives. If applied by the Supreme Court – as it will be if Trump gets one more justice on it – it would wipe out the right to privacy, which undergirds the rights to abortion and contraception, since “privacy” isn’t found in the constitution and doesn’t have the same history as “vagueness” does (at least according to Gorsuch).It would also sharply limit equal protection law, endangering recent curbs on racial, gender, and sexual orientation discrimination. And it would likely limit all kinds of federal regulations based on the commerce clause. Originalism is the judicial key to rolling back the administrative state.Today, however, originalism led to a liberal result. The government has been deporting people based on crimes that are vaguely defined. And that, liberals and Justice Gorsuch agree, violates the Fifth Amendment. Today, the unlikely hero for legal immigrants caught in ICE’s web is Justice Neil Gorsuch."},
 {'title': 'How Bobby Kennedy’s Funeral Train United America',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Robert F. Kennedy funeral train of June 1968 has become an American icon. As it rumbled slowly through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, we see the faces of a lost country, frozen for history from grief and reverence.Thanks to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, that national moment has been brought back to us, especially the faces. We see them both in the photographs taken from the train and by those taken by regular people from alongside the tracks. Look at them—African Americans in Philadelphia and Baltimore, smaller groups of whites in the open country in between—the old Democratic coalition. This is the alliance Bobby Kennedy tried so hard to hold together amid the then-deepening national divide over civil rights and the Vietnam War. Kennedy knew himself the power of pictures, “optics” as we say in today’s politics. Running for president the spring of 1968, he sent a message of civic unity by the way he rode through racially tense Gary, Indiana, in an open car. On one side sat the middle-weight boxing champion Tony Zale, a white man, and on the other side sat Richard Hatcher, the city’s first African-American mayor. The presidential candidate in the middle wanted the city and the country to see he cared about both communities, which he did.African Americans knew, of course, his record on civil rights. When President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas, even Bobby wondered why it had not been he who’d been targeted that tragic November.And for good reason.BEASTPHOTO1/5Bobby had been President Kennedy’s enforcer in integrating Ole Miss and the University of Alabama. What many didn’t know is how he got the young Birmingham, Alabama, street protesters out on bail, or how he pushed his brother to give that famous national TV address pushing the historic civil rights bill.But if it defined him to millions, it didn’t limit him.What made Bobby Kennedy unique, the liberal columnist Jack Newfield wrote, “was that he felt the same empathy for white workingmen and women that he felt for Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans. He thought of cops, waitresses, construction workers and firefighters as his people.” That was a fact. The senator from New York was noticed as the lone Democratic liberal to make a point each morning to say hello to members of the Capitol Police as he passed. When I heard that from an eye witness, it told me something about the man.We’ve gotten so used to treating our politics as zero-sum. If you are for the cause of minority rights, you must be anti-police. If you’re sympathetic to the white factory worker in the Rust Belt, you must be against the aspirations of the young African American in the city. But why can’t there be a patriotism that joins us together instead of dividing us? Don’t we need leaders eager to champion the future of black, Latino, and white working people together?The proof that this is possible is on display right now in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in an exhibit\xa0co-curated by Clément Chéroux and Linde Lehtinen. We see the photographs taken from that Robert Kennedy funeral train, also those taken and saved by the on-lookers themselves.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.It’s no surprise that one of the professional photos, taken by Paul Fusco, encouraged me to write my biography of Kennedy. His picture is of a small white family, obviously very poor. It shows the father and son saluting, the mother her hand to her chest, all in reverence for their lost hero.There were the larger crowds, of course. None of us who watched that day will forget the African Americans in Philly singing “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”What grabs me even now is not so much that either group is there showing their patriotic respect but that both are there together.The best way to honor Bobby Kennedy’s memory, beyond this great exhibit at SFMOMA by Clement Cheroux, is to find ways to bring that unity back.I can still see the expressions of their faces that grey June afternoon—young, old, black, white, men and women, few well-off, all caught up in their shared devastation.Why? Because the man whose body was being carried to Arlington Cemetery was the one American leader of their lives who refused to turn his eyes from the people swept aside in our country’s rush for economic prosperity and global prominence. Nobody knew it better, more deeply than they themselves.\xa0It shows in their faces.Chris Matthews is host of MSNBC’s Hardball and author of Bobby Kennedy: A Raging Spirit."},
 {'title': 'Trump Misses Hope Hicks as ‘Traitors’ Keep Leaking',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As Donald Trump’s communications operation has reached a Lord of the Flies level of infighting, the president and many of his staffers find themselves waxing nostalgic about a bygone Hope Hicks era.Hicks’ departure nearly two months ago left a leadership vacuum in the West Wing that has yet to be filled. Even the contest to replace her was racked by characteristic internal drama and knife-fighting, as press leaks related to two leading contenders to succeed Hicks—White House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp and Treasury Department public affairs chief Tony Sayegh—quickly split staffers into competing camps.More recent leaks have fueled tensions in the White House comms department, with the leak of press aide Kelly Sadler’s cruel comment about Sen. John McCain’s health last week setting off a round of internal recriminations. Details on internal meetings on the persistent problem of press leaks were also subsequently and very quickly leaked to various news outlets.“Not sure how sustainable this is going at this rate,” one senior White House official warned. The lack of a steady hand, the official suggested, will continue to hamstring any attempt to stem leaks and more effectively execute a cohesive communications strategy. According to two sources who have spoken with the president about this issue in recent days, he has expressed his desire for at least one prominent “leaker” to be conclusively identified and “dealt with,” in order to make an example of him or her. Some Trump allies outside the White House are equally, if not more, livid and threatening to name and shame West Wing staffers whom they believe to be among the most egregious of Trump-subverting leakers.Despite the recriminations, few people close to Trump or his senior staff actually believe that such a show of force will do anything to fundamentally fix the root problem.“This is a culture problem,” one former Trump administration official assessed. “You’re not going to stop the leaking by shuffling around lower-level staff. The only way to change the culture in the White House is if you start making changes with senior-level staff.” But while Trump has fumed about and discussed removing lower-level communications staffers, those close to the president do not expect him to make the one move that many agree is needed: hiring a Hicks successor to guide a chaotic White House communications operation.It has been less than two months since Hicks, one of Trump’s most trusted aides and his White House communications director, departed the administration under a cloud of the Rob Porter scandal, Trump-Russia fallout, and deep frustration with what she viewed as the mean-spiritedness of Washington politics. Hicks’ stint in the Trump White House saw no shortage of infighting, tumult, or aggressive leaking. But some of her former colleagues in the White House in part blame her absence—or the absence of a likable leader—for the current state of chaos, backbiting, and potentially looming leak hunts roiling the West Wing.Trump himself has personally reached out to Hicks in the weeks following her exit, according to a White House official, having staff deliver her a dictated message that he wished “Hopey,” as he calls her, well. It is unclear if they have spoken on the phone since Hicks ditched her White House job.“He obviously misses her and still talks about her often,” the West Wing aide noted, comparing it to “empty nest syndrome.”Hicks’ value to Trump often had little to do with her official title. She was a prominent source of personal support and comfort for an increasingly isolated president, and considered like close family.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“I don’t know that anyone else can really do the job the way it needs to be done because of how the president operates,” a former Trump White House official previously told The Daily Beast. “Hope always seemed like the only workable solution to that. Big loss in that respect.”The duties typically landing on a White House communication director’s desk have since been scattered, divided between senior officials such as Schlapp, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and, often for longer-term message strategy, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, according to three sources familiar with the post-Hicks arrangement.Though she bristles at suggestions that she might take the helm of the West Wing’s communications operation, Conway is an ubiquitous Trump defender on cable news, and has recently fired warning shots at those behind unauthorized leaks. She told Fox News on Monday evening that she had had “several discussions” with Trump about Sadler’s remarks and their emergence in the press. “It’s not so much leaking as using the media to shiv each other,” she said.Asked if she thought personnel changes were imminent as a consequence, Conway replied, “Yes, I do.” But in the Trump White House, personnel changes are often ad hoc affairs. No shakeup has yet been announced.In the meantime, morale in the White House press shop is in the pits, according to numerous sources in and outside of the West Wing. Officials don’t know who can be trusted. There is a pervasive sense that senior staffers have lost all control. Lower-level staff, especially, are constantly fearful of getting canned or scapegoated. Some wonder if they are being recorded. And staffers jokingly accuse each other of being “leakers” or a “spies.” Top communications aides including Sanders and Schlapp routinely decry, publicly and privately, the frequency of comms office gossip and deliberations quickly spilling over into full public view. And this all predated Sadler-gate.In one case, Axios published a story late last month on how Schlapp had “convened an off-site team-building and planning retreat… for the White House comms team,” and offered an inside look at the retreat. The depth of the detail, sourced to people in attendance, added to the distress and paranoia within the team, immediately prompting yet another spell of internal finger-pointing.“[It] was like someone lobbing a grenade over the fence,” one member of the comms team told The Daily Beast. This week, Trump himself weighed in on the seemingly relentless backstabbing racking his comms hub.“The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!” the president tweeted on Monday.The subject is obviously at the front of his mind. When the hate-tweet was posted to his official Twitter account, the president was, according to a White House official, in the Oval Office preparing to board Marine One to take him to Walter Reed hospital—where he was set to visit first lady Melania Trump who was there recovering from surgery the day after Mother’s Day.

 {'title': 'Dems Give Up on Trying to Get Cable News to Care About Anything but Russia',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Throughout the spring and early summer of 2017, congressional Democrats put together a comprehensive legislative and messaging plan to serve as the party’s foundation for the 2018 midterm elections. It centered around running against the concentration of economic power—chiefly within the pharmaceutical industry—and an ambitious, multi-faceted approach to enhancing conditions for workers both within and outside the workplace. The title was a bit cookie-cutter—”A Better Deal”—but the document was the result of numerous stakeholder meetings, strategy sessions, and late-night conferring. Naturally, the party wanted to have a flashy debut. So lawmakers went to Berryville, Virginia—a town in a district that Democrats had lost in the 2016 elections but were poised to flip in the upcoming cycle—to formally announce the plan. When they came back to D.C, they conducted additional press briefings in hopes of flooding the news cycle. And then Jared Kushner stepped out of the West Wing to a horde of cameras, to proclaim his innocence in the still nascent probe into Russian election meddling. “Let me be very clear,” Kushner said. “I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else on the campaign who did so.”In an instant, the public relations push was upended. Much of the media still covered “A Better Deal.” But cable news largely ignored it, choosing instead to chase the shiny new object presented before them by the president’s son-in-law.“In print and other places [coverage] was great. It was online. The Times did two big stories on it. The Post had a huge picture and story. And it was everywhere else online,” said one senior Democratic Senate aide involved in the PR push. “But cable news focused on Kushner.” For the past year, this has been the media landscape confronting Democrats. Eager to move a message that focuses on things like minimum wage hikes and health care premiums, they have been overtaken by a steady stream of stories of Russian meddling, porn star payoffs, and shady Trump-world figures. Ultimately, many offices and aides have come to the conclusion that they should simply give up on trying to break through on cable news at all.“It’s impossible,” said one Senate aide, “unless you want to talk about Russia.”In conversations with The Daily Beast, numerous other aides echoed this point, sharing stories of fruitless calls and emails to bookers and abrupt cancellations on pre-existing bookings. Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said she was bumped three times from a prime-time MSNBC show due to Trump scandals. “It’s difficult to break through with stories about teachers’ strikes or assaults on voting rights because there’s a new bad thing that Trump has done or Scott Pruitt has done in every news cycle,” Post, whose group has helped flip 40 state legislative seats since Trump’s inauguration, told The Daily Beast. The phenomenon has had ripple effects throughout both politics and media. Michael Avenatti, a previously little-known lawyer based in Los Angeles, is now a household name for political junkies. On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, a number of mid-level members have become veritable cable stars, owing to their posts on intelligence and oversight committees, while more senior members in traditionally powerful domestic policy posts remain off air.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“If you don’t have some sort of nexus to foreign affairs, it is very difficult to get people booked,” said one senior House Democratic aide. No one in Democratic politics views this as an existential problem, since the universe of cable news watchers is both small and confined largely to those who are already politically attuned. But there is also some fear that a perception is taking hold that the party is obsessively focused on a Russia-collusion message above all else.“Republicans are wrong and know that they’re wrong if they say the Democrats’ message is Stormy Daniels.”— Josh Schwerin, communications director for Priorities USA“Every Democrat in the country could say the same seven-word slogan about jobs and it wouldn’t shift what cable is covering,” Josh Schwerin, communications director for Priorities USA, told The Daily Beast. “Republicans are wrong and know that they’re wrong if they say the Democrats’ message is Stormy Daniels.”To combat mixed perceptions, leadership has repeatedly encouraged lawmakers to ignore the noise, remain focused on other matters, chief among them wage growth and health care premiums, and push their messaging through alternate methods of communication. A prime example of this is Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT), who has created a sprawling media empire of his own. Sanders, who still does appear on cable broadcasts, has hosted online town halls on specific issues like Medicare for All and income inequality. The health care town hall, which Sanders said networks were not receptive to, drew in more than a million viewers. Leadership has encouraged lawmakers to do more local news outreach in addition to making use of live-streaming technologies. A number of Democrats, meanwhile, have taken to outlets geared to younger audiences to talk about major policy issues. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) recently spoke to Bustle about prison reform, while Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) told NowThis News why she was co-sponsoring a marijuana-decriminalization bill. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) talked about his own marijuana bill with Vice. “People are struggling to afford health care, child care, and college. They are working longer hours for lower wages. The American people want to hear how we can make their lives better and improve their standard of living,” Josh Miller-Lewis, spokesperson for Sanders, told The Daily Beast. “Yet for the most part, those issues are not discussed on a daily basis by cable news shows tracking the latest tweet about Russia.”Although Democrats lament their inability to compel cable news to care about topics other than Russia, they don’t begrudge the programming itself. There is a recognition that the story of potential collusion is unique in its import. The party also isn’t exactly despondent about having the president’s legal troubles—and dalliances with porn stars—be the fixture of most nightly conversations. And so, as the midterms near, Democrats are increasingly content to let Trump have cable, understanding that his ability to drive the conversation on that particular medium isn’t always an advantage.“I think it’s important to keep in mind that the people watching cable news is a pretty small percentage of voters,” Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, told The Daily Beast. “We’ve created a vicious feedback loop where Trump watches cable news, makes news based off of what he sees on cable news, cable news then responds to it, and it perpetuates the cycle of news begetting news. But that’s not true for most voters.” "},
 {'title': 'When Mueller Worked With Manafort’s Dictator Client',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Almost exactly five years ago, Bob Mueller met Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, then a client of Paul Manafort. At the time, the meeting drew little attention—just a Facebook post from the Ukrainian Embassy in the U.S. and a few short write-ups from wire services. But now, the moment has historical significance: It brought together two men who would later (indirectly) face off in a legal battle that’s shaking the White House and its allies. The FBI and Mueller’s spokesman both declined to comment for this story. The meeting took place in Kyiv. The European Pressphoto Agency snapped a picture of them shaking hands, with Mueller wearing his trademark black suit and muted tie, and Yanukovych grinning. Ukraine General Newswire reported that the two men discussed counterterror cooperation, which made sense: The pair met about two months after the Boston Marathon bombing. “I would like to focus on the most important issue for us – the issue of combating terrorism,” Mueller said, according to a Ukrainian Embassy’s Facebook post. “I would like to say thank you for the assistance provided to us after the Boston Marathon.”Yanukovych sounded pleased with the meeting, according to the Facebook post. “Ukrainian-American cooperation efficiently develops in many spheres of mutual interest,” he said at the time. “Your visit is very interesting for Ukraine and relations between our law enforcement bodies have established good traditions of cooperation and communication in the course of 20 years. I am confident that there is a potential for further broadening of cooperation.” Yanukovych also said Ukraine was close to signing an agreement with the European Union. “There are some preparations left but I hope that we will fulfill everything and sign the Agreement,” he said at the meeting. That agreement—which Ukraine never signed—was a key focus of Paul Manafort’s lobbying work for Yanukovych. Manafort retained two American lobbying firms, The Podesta Group and Mercury LLC, to try to persuade members of Congress and think tank staff that Ukraine was moving in the direction of the West, even though Yanukovych was close with Putin and had imprisoned his main political rival, Yulia Tymosheko. The meeting with Mueller came at a time when Yanukovych was looking to burnish his reputation with the West. And John Herbst, the United States ambassador to Ukraine from September 2003 to May 2006, said Yanukovych was always open to cooperating with the United States—but with a catch.“Yanukovych was happy to pursue cooperation with the U.S. except if it touched upon his core interests in Ukraine, which were related—among other things—to ensuring his friends got their share of the national pie, and things that might have ticked off the Kremlin,” Herbst said. “He was out for the good of himself, his group, and also his country, starting with himself and his group,” Herbst continued. “And for that, having a good relationship with the U.S. was a counter to being overly dependent on the Kremlin.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

As head of the country’s security service in 2014, Yakymenko appears to have signed off on a violent crackdown that resulted in the death of Euromaidan protesters. After the protests, he fled to Russia, according to Interfax-Ukraine. On Feb. 26, 2014, the country’s prosecutor general announced Yakymenko was wanted for the murder of protesters. “You can’t predict ahead of time who’s going to end up with blood on their hands,” said Evelyn Farkas, a former Defense Department official focused on the region, of Mueller’s meeting with Yakymenko. The Kremlin cheered Yanukovych’s 2010 presidential election victory, and the United States considered those elections free and fair. Former U.S. diplomats told The Daily Beast that they essentially gave Yanukovych a clean slate. A few years into his presidency, however, American officials had largely soured on him. Publicly, Yanukovych had tried to balance friendliness toward the West and toward Russia, playing both sides against each other. But over the years, he built a reputation as an “authoritarian in democrat’s clothing.” As Freedom House detailed, he concentrated power among his family members and close personal allies. “By 2013, people saw he was leading the country in a more authoritarian direction and so he wasn’t getting a lot of facetime with senior officials,” said Steve Pifer, America’s ambassador to Ukraine from 1998 to 2000. “My guess is he heard Mueller was coming. If Mueller had not asked for the meeting, Yanukovych probably would have proposed it.”Mueller made other stops in Eastern Europe. On May 7, 2013—a month before visiting Ukraine—he visited Moscow “to discuss cooperation on the Boston bombing,” according to a 2014 Congressional Research Service report. Before Mueller’s Moscow trip, Obama and Putin agreed in a phone call to cooperate more closely on counterterrorism efforts, per the report. Yanukovych has now become a central focus of Mueller’s investigation into possible coordination between Trump associates and the Kremlin. On April 2 of this year, Mueller’s team filed a memo in federal court showing that when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized the special counsel probe, he specifically highlighted Yanukovych (PDF). The memo said Mueller was specifically authorized to investigate allegations that Manafort “[c]ommitted a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych.”And on Thursday, The Guardian reported that Manafort directed American lobbyists to smear Yanukovych’s foes in the United States—without filing the lawfully required lobbying disclosure forms. Last year, Manafort was indicted in federal court on a number of counts, including charges related to the work he did for Yanukovych. The Mueller-Yanukovych meeting didn’t surprise numerous experts on the region who spoke to The Daily Beast. And it has likely benefited Mueller in his investigation. “Mueller will be as well positioned as any human being on earth to obtain full cooperation,” Jonathan Winer, former deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement, told The Daily Beast. “They would know him and they would trust him.“To the extent they’ve got the same people in place, he’s going to know how to push the levers, push the buttons to achieve maximum cooperation, which the Ukranians would be likely to give the U.S. under almost any circumstances,” Winer added. Herbst also said the experience would likely benefit Mueller. “He’s not quite a neophyte in this particular area,” Herbst said. Whether it yields anything concrete is a whole different question. But it’s certainly a plus.”"},
 {'title': 'National Enquirer Publisher: It’s Our First Amendment Right to Silence Karen McDougal Over Trump',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The National Enquirer’s publisher claims its agreement to purchase and bury former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story of her alleged affair with President Trump is protected by the First Amendment, according to new court filings.On Monday, American Media, Inc. (AMI) asked a Los Angeles court to dismiss McDougal’s lawsuit, which seeks to release her from a “catch and kill” contract that gave the company exclusive rights to her story in exchange for $150,000. McDougal, who allegedly had a 10-month affair with Trump beginning in 2006, says she was pressured into signing the hush agreement months before Election Day.In her complaint, McDougal claims AMI violated public policy by working secretly with Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen, to buy her silence. Her payout amounts to an illegal, in-kind corporate contribution that was intended to influence the election, her lawsuit states.But AMI says there’s nothing illegal about their agreement.“If AMI had exercised its editorial discretion to publish McDougal’s story, she would have no argument that such publication was an illegal in-kind campaign contribution,” AMI’s counsel, Jean-Paul Jassy, wrote in Monday’s court filing. “But editors also have a First Amendment right not to publish, and cannot be punished for exercising that right.”McDougal’s attorney, Peter Stris, released a statement accusing AMI of trying to silence the fitness model once again with its anti-SLAPP, or strategic lawsuit against public participation, claim against her.“The irony of today’s motion by American Media Inc. to strike Karen McDougal’s lawsuit is unmistakable,” Stris said. “As we have learned through brave truth-tellers like Ms. McDougal, the tabloid went to great lengths to silence her and others, and they are now attempting to silence her again with the absurd claim that their own free speech was violated.”“Needless to say, we look forward to opposing their motion,” he concluded. Meanwhile, AMI released a statement saying the company is “very proud of Karen McDougal and our collaborative relationship that has produced good journalism and content for our publications and we hope that she will continue to be a valued contributor.” “While we dispute her legal claims, as our anti-SLAPP motion makes clear, we look forward to reaching an amicable resolution satisfactory to her and to AMI.”McDougal’s case is one of several relating to President Trump, who is being sued by porn star Stormy Daniels to void her own “hush agreement” over her alleged tryst with the commander in chief. Trump also faces a defamation suit from former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, who has accused him of sexual misconduct.

In its motion, the publisher pointed to The New York Times’ $1,000 payment to a survivor of the Titanic in 1912 and Larry Flynt’s $1-million offer for intel on adulterous politicians, among other examples. Even if AMI quashed McDougal’s story to protect Trump’s candidacy, “it is routine and constitutionally protected for the media to express a political view,” the court filing stated. “News publishers have helped and hurt politicians from time immemorial,” the motion added. “Leading periodicals often endorse and excoriate individual candidates.”AMI then used Hillary Clinton as an example, saying 57 of 100 of America’s largest newspapers endorsed her in 2016, while only two endorsed Trump.AMI’s CEO, David Pecker, is close friends with Trump, according to McDougal’s lawsuit and Ronan Farrow’s New Yorker piece on McDougal’s deal. (One former AMI editor told The New Yorker of Pecker, “We never printed a word about Trump without his approval.”)Her lawsuit claims AMI “continues to intimidate Ms. McDougal with legal and financial threats if she speaks with the press.” And it says that she was misled about the terms of her deal. McDougal says she was promised two magazine covers—including one on Men’s Fitness—and two years of monthly feature print articles and weekly online columns. (AMI says McDougal wrote 19 articles, was featured in six articles and was on four different covers, but the company is not obligated to publish her work.)AMI and her former attorney—Keith Davidson, who also brokered Stormy Daniels’ NDA with Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen—failed to tell her the contract’s fine print didn’t obligate the publisher to run her columns, her lawsuit says. In Monday’s motion to dismiss, AMI denied the agreement was against public policy. The parent company, too, denied that McDougal is prohibited from speaking to the press. AMI says that McDougal negotiated an amended agreement giving her permission to respond to “legitimate press inquiries” about the Trump affair. McDougal filed her lawsuit seeking to void the contract on March 20. Two days later, she detailed her alleged romance with Trump in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper.She told Cooper she filed the lawsuit to get her “life rights back.”“I want to share my truth, because everyone else is talking about my truth. I need to share my story. Everyone else is talking about it,” McDougal said."},
 {'title': 'Private Prison Company Made Detainees Work For Toilet Paper, Lawsuit Alleges',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A private prison company forced immigrant detainees to work for as little as $1 per day if they wanted toilet paper, toothpaste, and safe lodging, according to a new lawsuit filed on Tuesday. The class action suit, filed in federal court for the Middle District of Georgia, pits three plaintiffs––Wilhen Hill Barrientos, Margarito Velazquez Galicia, and Shoahib Ahmed––against CoreCivic, the nation’s largest private prison company. Barrientos and Velazquez Galicia are both currently detained in the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Ga. Ahmed was previously detained there before giving up his asylum claim. The three allege that CoreCivic is violating a federal anti-human trafficking law with the work program that it oversees. The detention center characterizes its work program as voluntary. But according to the lawsuit detainees are paid pennies per hour––generally $1 to $4 per day—for tasks such as mopping floors, scrubbing toilets, and serving meals. The lawsuit quotes a report from the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general finding that staff at the Stewart facility didn’t give detainees soap, toilet paper, and toothpaste “promptly or at all when detainees ran out of them.” “In one instance, Mr. Barrientos ran out of toilet paper and requested another roll from a CoreCivic officer,” the lawsuit says. “The CoreCivic officer told Mr. Barrientos to use his fingers to clean himself.”According to the lawsuit, detainees are directed to use their wages to buy toilet paper and other hygiene products from the detention center commissary. And the only way immigrants can talk to their family outside the detention center is if they buy costly phone cards from the commissary, according to the lawsuit. The suit says officers at the facility threatened to revoke Barrientos’ access to the commissary if he called in sick. Immigrants who resist participating in the work program can face criminal charges or up to 30 days in solitary confinement, the suit says. They also are subjected to worse living quarters. Those who participate in the work program sometimes get to stay in private two-person “pods” with functioning showers and private bathrooms—a notable upgrade from the conditions of the main dormitories. “There is no privacy,” the suit says of those dormitories. “The lights in these dorms are on all day and night, requiring some detained immigrants to fold socks over their eyes in order to sleep. There is one bathroom in these dorms with three to four toilets, three to four urinals, and four sinks. This shared bathroom is often filthy, to the extent that the pod residents at times have to plug or cover their noses to avoid the overwhelming and festering stench. The showers in the open dormitories do not have temperature control and provide only extremely hot water. The open dormitories are also the site of frequent conflict and even violence. Indeed, the detained immigrants refer to open dormitories as ‘El Gallinero,’ or ‘the Chicken Coop,’ for both the conditions and overcrowded living quarters.”CoreCivic on Wednesday said their work program complies with all federal rules. "As a matter of policy, we do not comment on pending litigation," said spokesperson Jonathan Burns. "Regarding detainee work in our facilities, all work programs at our ICE detention facilities are completely voluntary and operated in full compliance with ICE standards, including federally mandated statutory reimbursement rates for Voluntary Work Program participants. We have worked in close partnership with ICE for more than 30 years and will continue to provide a safe and humane environment to those entrusted to our care."Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center are working with the litigants, as are attorneys from Project South, Burns Charest LLP, and the Law Office of R. Andrew Free.

Last year, a federal judge in Colorado granted class certification to a similar lawsuit, letting thousands of current and former detainees join on to a lawsuit against GEO Group, the country’s second biggest private prison company. These lawsuits have drawn the attention of lawmakers. Earlier this year, 18 Republican members of Congress wrote a letter defending forced labor practices under the justification that work programs are good for morale. '},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee prepares to vote on President Donald Trump’s secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders appeared on Fox & Friends Monday morning and accused anyone planning to vote against him of being unpatriotic. “Look, at some point, Democrats have to decide whether they love this country more than they hate this president,” Sanders said on Fox News. “And they have to decide that they want to put the safety and the security and the diplomacy of our country ahead of their own political games. And we’re very hopeful that they will.”Sanders cited the fact that Pompeo was “top of his class” at Harvard and “first in his class” at Westpoint, but those credentials have little to do with the opposition to Pompeo from every Democratic member of the committee in addition to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).During his confirmations hearings earlier this month, Pompeo was forced to defend his hawkish positions on Iran and Russia and refused to apologize for Islamophobic comments he had made in the past. “My record is exquisite with respect to treating each and every faith with the dignity that they deserved,” the current CIA director insisted. Last fall, Pompeo delivered false and misleading statements about the intelligence community’s findings on Russian interference in the 2016 election. While Pompeo said at a security conference, “The intelligence community's assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election,” the official report directly stated, “We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.” “Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State,” President Trump tweeted on Monday, shortly after his press secretary’s appearance on Fox & Friends. “The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. Need more Republicans!” "},
 {'title': 'The Fight to Replace Hope Hicks in the Trump White House Enters Its ‘Smear Campaign Stage’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The race to become the next White House Communications Director has degenerated into a round of backstabbing and factionalism that has taken aback even the most jaded of White House aides and allies.One White House official described the contest to replace departing Trump adviser Hope Hicks as being well into its “smear campaign stage.” Another senior administration official dubbed it as a “battle royale.” And a Republican official close to the White House bemoaned yet another heavy shot of “palace intrigue and backstabbing” in an administration uniquely notorious for both.It all started when news broke late last month that Hicks—one of President Donald Trump’s longest serving and most trusted aides—would soon depart the West Wing after the first year of the presidency. \xa0Very quickly, a shortlist of potential successors began to form led by two frontrunners: Mercedes Schlapp, the Trump White House’s director of strategic communications, and Tony Sayegh, the Treasury department’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Both are former staples on Fox News, President Trump’s favorite channel, and were friendly toward one another during their time at the network.No sooner did their names surface than the leaking began.Last week, the Washington Examiner published a story on how “tensions” were soaring over the “search for Hope Hicks successor.” The piece was the first to outline the emerging Team Mercy and Team Tony camps, and included one notably eye-popping nugget. According to Examiner sources, Sayegh has a penchant to “delegate too much,” and is a “terrible bully.” The paper reported that one anonymous “senior administration official said such behavior has been particularly noticeable in Sayegh’s interactions with female staff.”Tellingly, the Examiner had another source saying the allegation was “definitely somebody knifing him” and paraphrased the source as indicating that such “claims could damage his chances regardless of their authenticity.”The Daily Beast spoke to ten senior Trump administration officials recently about Sayegh and none could pinpoint, corroborate, or provide specific examples of the alleged problems he has with women. Two women who’ve worked with him during the Trump era independently referred to the charge as “bullshit.” Another who works closely with him bluntly assessed: “100 percent not true and a complete cheap shot.”The Examiner article was seen in the Trump administration as an opening salvo in an increasingly hostile power struggle—one that is exacerbating internal tensions and fueling suspicion within the administration as to who was “knifing” and smearing whom. Sayegh, for his part, knows exactly where he’s pointing the finger. Two Trump administration sources told The Daily Beast that he has, in private conversation with allies, blamed Schlapp by name for the allegations that appeared in the Examiner and believes she is attempting to “ratfuck” him, as one official characterized it.Schlapp, according to those who have spoken to her, has emphatically denied this.Some administration officials, former and current, remain incredulous. Seb Gorka, a controversial former White House official and ex-aide to ousted chief strategist Steve Bannon, tweeted last week that “I think we know who that is,” in response to a claim by GOP operative Arthur Schwartz that the sexism allegations were “obviously planted by someone competing for the job.”The tension is so rampant that it has caught the attention of Trump’s inner circle. Two White House sources told The Daily Beast that Hicks herself in a staff meeting last week reminded officials to refrain generally from backstabbing, leaking to the press, or spreading innuendo or rumors about any colleagues. (Trump aides subsequently noted the irony of leaking details of this part of the meeting to The Daily Beast.)

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Outside the administration, Trump allies have noticed the constant intrigue and chaos, too.“It should always be the number-one goal of anyone working in the administration to keep their focus on the president’s agenda, and that’s how the entire team succeeds,” Vice President Mike Pence’s former press secretary Marc Lotter told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “Anything that distracts from that is distracting from the president’s agenda...If people are talking about themselves or each other, that does not serve [President Trump] well.”Until recently, Schlapp was widely viewed as the favorite to help fill the Hicks-sized power vacuum. Last month, before Hicks resigned, CNN reported that Schlapp had “increasingly helmed day-to-day tasks in the communications department and become a go-to for officials outside the communications department looking for messaging guidance”—right around the time Hicks was grappling with Rob Porter and Trump-Russia fallout.Sayegh’s has been in a comparably strong position due to the amount of credit he has received for his work with White House senior staff on messaging strategy during the ultimately successful tax-bill push. According to White House officials, Hicks, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and the president’s senior adviser and daughter Ivanka Trump have all praised Sayegh’s work in recent days—but have not staked out a clear position on who they favor to take the helm after Hicks leaves.The position has remained stubbornly open and could be for some time. Sources close to Trump say that he isn’t fully sold on either Schlapp or Sayegh, and is also considering poaching from outside the administration, possibly from cable news.On Wednesday evening, The Atlantic reported that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been in talks with Trump for a “potential compromise,” in which Conway would take control of the comms operation on an “interim basis,” according to the magazine, before a “permanent replacement was found.” Conway has repeatedly stressed to people for weeks that she does not want the comms job and instead wants to take a senior role in policy.Those close to the president don’t expect him to make his final decision until Hicks’s absence actually starts being felt. Allies of both Schlapp and Sayegh have expressed concern that if Trump hasn’t tapped either one of them by this point, it could be potentially fatal for their chances.“If you were to ask me today who was most likely to get the White House communications director job between Tony and Mercy, I would say Tony,” one source close to the Trump White House said. “But if you were to ask me who is most likely to get the job between Tony, Mercy, and [current] ‘Fox News Personality X,’ I would go with Fox News Personality X.’”In fact, President Trump had been looking to at least one such former “Fox News Personality X” type. As CNN first reported, the president had discussed the position with Bill Shine, former co-president of Fox News who was forced to depart the conservative cable-news giant following criticism for how he handled various sexual harassment accusations at Fox. Trump considered Shine for a senior role last year, as well.But Shine has taken his name out of consideration, The Daily Beast confirmed. One person close to the former Roger Ailes lieutenant said he did not “relish submitting himself” to another round of negative media attention, relating to his handling of Fox News scandals.For now, Shine is leaving the infighting and round of negative coverage up to everyone else."},
 {'title': 'How Kennedy and King Pushed Each Other to Greatness',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In his biography of Sen. John Kennedy published during the 1960 presidential campaign, historian James MacGregor Burns portrayed the young candidate as charming and intellectual but he worried that Kennedy lacked the character to lead the nation in extraordinary times. Burns recalled that Franklin Roosevelt once described the presidency as “pre-eminently a place of moral leadership. All our great Presidents were leaders of thought at times when certain historic ideas in the life of the nation had to be clarified.”When President Kennedy moved into the Oval Office in 1961, America was in a state of escalating unrest over the unequal treatment of the nation’s 20 million blacks. Though he hadn’t yet realized it, the new president was hurtling toward a crucial test of his leadership on the top domestic and moral issue of the day: civil rights. The battle to end segregation in the South and to curb discrimination throughout the country also challenged the leadership skills of the most powerful voice in the black community, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Over the next two and a half years, Kennedy and King challenged each other to evolve as leaders. Their relationship stands as a poignant historical reminder to those in power today: that greatness awaits leaders who look beyond their differences, listen to disparate opinions, and maintain fidelity to our founding principles.At a private breakfast meeting during the presidential campaign, Kennedy told King that the nation needed “strong executive leadership” on civil rights, according to King’s recollection of their conversation. Kennedy assured King that he was ready to push forward to achieve equal rights for all Americans. “If he received the nomination and was elected,” he told King, “he could give this kind of leadership.”But after his election, President Kennedy pulled away from his promises to King, shoving civil rights into the background and focusing instead on his economic and foreign policy agenda. As the Freedom Rides of 1961 spurred violence in the South, bloodying young black and white activists, Kennedy maintained his distance, placing his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy at the forefront of the crisis. The Freedom Rides desegregated interstate travel, terminals, restaurants, waiting rooms, water faucets, restrooms—and also inaugurated a more confrontational approach to protest. What the president failed to understand was that the momentum of the civil rights movement was quickening and that he could no longer address reform at his own slow pace. “The president’s transformation was a triumph not only for black Americans but for King himself.”The Freedom Rides, organized largely by students, deployed a strategy that was more aggressive than anything King had undertaken. King had shot to fame as the leader of the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955-1956, which desegregated the city’s buses. But, unlike the confrontational approach of the students, his tactic was passive resistance. Blacks just refused to ride Montgomery buses until the government and the companies gave in. After his success, King disengaged somewhat from protest, concentrating on his speaking engagements, raising money, and building the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Though King was still young, the even younger student activists of the Freedom Rides were coming up behind him, and forcing King to consider their direct, yet nonviolent, approach. King had not ridden on the buses during the Freedom Rides and instead mostly offered oratorical support and showed up during extreme crises. As historian Adam Fairclough has observed King regarded the rides as “brave but also reckless and provocative.” According to Fairclough, King’s “leadership seemed less than inspiring and betrayed an impression of timidity and indecisiveness.”King was searching for a way to reclaim unquestioned stature as the leader of the movement. He recognized the Freedom Riders’ success in spurring government action by eliciting a brutal, highly publicized response from white racists. King absorbed the example, pondered it, and understood its profound implications. What was needed, he realized, was not just passive resistance but sustained, publicized pressure on the government.After speaking at the National Press Club in July 1962, King warned President Kennedy about his continued inattention to civil rights. “There is still a great deal to be done,” he told reporters, “and I must honestly say that I do not think the president has yet given the kind of leadership in this area that the enormity of the problem demands.”The president’s hesitation drove King to adopt the more aggressive tactics he had observed among the younger activists. In planning his biggest undertaking yet—an assault on segregation in Birmingham, Alabama—King prepared himself for the front lines. He decided he would march with other protesters, stare down the brutal police of Birmingham, and face certain jailing. As Andrew Young, a campaign leader, observed of King: “That, I think, was the beginning of his true leadership.”And King didn’t stop there. He agreed to enlist children as foot soldiers for equal rights, sending students as young as 6 into the streets to face water cannons and police dogs and arrest. The television images and the newspaper photos of young protesters blasted to the ground by high-powered fire hoses and confronted by snarling German shepherds disgusted President Kennedy.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Kennedy was observing and learning and evolving; he was approaching Roosevelt’s ideal of presidential leadership.“Their relationship stands as a poignant historical reminder to those in power today: that greatness awaits leaders who look beyond their differences, listen to disparate opinions, and maintain fidelity to our founding principles.”Finally he recognized what King had repeatedly tried to impress upon him: that civil rights was a moral issue. President Kennedy had come to view the black predicament through the eyes of a black citizen and to accept that only significant federal action could bring racial progress.On June 11, 1963, he went live before the nation to announce he would introduce landmark civil rights legislation. In his speech, he demonstrated an empathy for the black experience in America: “If an American, because his skin is dark... cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place?”The president’s transformation was a triumph not only for black Americans but for King himself. Although never claiming credit, King had played an instrumental role in Kennedy’s awakening on civil rights. His oratory, his pitched street battles, and his time spent in jail forced a distant president to pay attention and grow into the moral leader the nation needed.As Congressman John Lewis told me: “The very being, the very presence, of Martin Luther King Jr. pricked the conscience of John F. Kennedy.”Steven Levingston, the nonfiction editor of The Washington Post, is author of Kennedy and King: The President, the Pastor, and the Battle Over Civil Rights."},
 {'title': 'Ex-Playboy Model Karen McDougal: Trump Told Me He Loved Me Constantly',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A former Playboy model who said she had a 10-month affair with President Trump told her story for the first time Thursday night on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360°—saying she was in love with the reality TV star and didn’t know he had other women. Karen McDougal told Anderson Cooper she saw Trump at least five times a month through 2006 until April 2007, when she ended the relationship. She said they slept together dozens of times without protection and that she was unaware Trump was apparently seeing other people, including porn star Stormy Daniels.“He was so sweet,” McDougal said. “Like what everyone sees on TV, I didn’t see in that man. Because that man was very sweet, very respectful, very loving, very kind and caring. That’s the man I saw.”McDougal’s exclusive interview came two days after she filed a lawsuit to free her from a non-disclosure agreement about her alleged affair with Trump—and three days before Daniels’ interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes is scheduled to air.On Tuesday, McDougal sued American Media Inc. (AMI), the parent company of The National Enquirer. The tabloid paid McDougal $150,000 to obtain exclusive rights to her story of her sexual relationship with Trump, then buried it. The payoff was allegedly made to protect the president, who is a friend of AMI’s chief executive. The CNN special largely covered what’s already been reported on McDougal’s story, which was revealed in Ronan Farrow’s New Yorker investigation and detailed in McDougal’s lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County.But McDougal’s television interview also humanized Trump.She told Cooper she met Trump while filming Celebrity Apprentice at the Playboy Mansion, where she was hired to work a pool party scene. The event, according to The New Yorker, occurred in June 2006.“You know, he said hello like he would to anybody. And then throughout the night, it was kind of obvious that there was an attraction from his part to me, and I just kind of blew it off,” McDougal recalled of that fateful day.Trump was watching McDougal so much, she said, that the Playboy Bunny “house mother” told her, “Wow, this guy’s really into you.” They struck up a conversation, and Trump got her phone number. She didn’t consider dating him, she said, but was interested in getting to know this “brilliant” businessman. They spoke on the phone before Trump next visited Los Angeles, which McDougal says was on or around his birthday on June 12. “He would call me. I would call him. I had many of his phone numbers,” McDougal said.The 1998 Playmate of the Year said she had a few of Trump’s direct numbers, his bodyguard Keith Schiller’s digits, and the number of Trump’s personal secretary. “But I had all these phone numbers, so if I couldn’t reach him on one, depending on where he’s going to be, I would call the other.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

She was upset when he allegedly tried to pay her for sex. That night, Schiller picked McDougal up and drove her to the back of the hotel. McDougal was expecting dinner in the restaurant, but she ended up in the bungalow. “At that moment, I realized maybe something else was going on,” McDougal said. They talked and got to know one another for a few hours, then became intimate. When Cooper asked if McDougal was attracted to Trump, she replied, “I was attracted to him, yeah. He’s a nice-looking man, and you know, I liked his charisma. I love good, great posture. He’s got great posture, and he was nice.”“I was attracted to him, yeah. He’s a nice-looking man, and you know, I liked his charisma.”After they had sex, the night ended on a strange note; Trump allegedly tried to hand her money. “After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me, and I actually didn’t know how to take that,” McDougal said. She added, “The look on my face must have been so sad, because I had never been offered money like that before, number 1. But number 2, I thought, ‘Does he think that I’m in this for money or why I’m here tonight. Or is this a normal thing?”McDougal turned to Trump and said, “That’s not me. I’m not that kind of girl.” She said the future president replied, “You’re really special.” McDougal told Cooper that she left and cried in the car on her way home. “It really hurt me, but I went back,” she said. McDougal showed Cooper a daily planner, where she marked down every time she saw Trump with a “T” or a “DT.” She didn’t put his full name in writing not only to protect Trump but her own reputation, she said. Her friends and her sister knew about her relationship with Trump, she said. She told her mother they were only friends, and her mother warned her about being involved with a married man. One time, just like Stormy Daniels, McDougal said she put Trump on speakerphone while her sister listened to their call. “When you have a relationship with somebody, you don’t hide it, right? If there’s feelings, you don’t hide that relationship,” McDougal said. Asked if Trump ever asked for her discretion, McDougal said no. “Never,” McDougal said. “In fact, I think once he asked, ‘Does your sister know?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, she knows.’ And he’s like, ‘Awww.’”Trump only brought up his wife, Melania, once that McDougal could recall. He said Melania “was an intelligent woman” and that “she knew four or five languages.”“But other than that he never talked about his wife and I never brought her up,” McDougal said, adding that his marriage was “out of sight, out of mind.”McDougal teared up when asked how she viewed the relationship. “I know it’s wrong. I’m really sorry for that. I know it’s a wrong thing to do,” she said, pausing to collect herself. “Back in the day I was a different girl. I had fun. I was in the Playboy scene. I was just enjoying life as much as I could.“When I got with him, there was a real relationship there,” she added. “There were real feelings between the two of us.” Trump allegedly told her he loved her constantly and called her “baby” and “beautiful Karen.”McDougal said she not only saw Trump in Los Angeles but went to the same Lake Tahoe golf tournament with him where he allegedly bedded Daniels. She said she booked her own airfare and hotels to hide a paper trail but that Trump would reimburse her. At Christmas, McDougal got Trump a present, she said. And while she said he never bought her gifts, he did tell her he was giving her a New York apartment but that it was being renovated. (Trump, too, allegedly offered Daniels a pad in Trump Tower.)While McDougal said she was in love, the guilt ate away at her. She said meeting Trump at the home he shared with Melania was too much for her. \xa0“I just couldn’t wait to get out of the apartment. I wanted to go back to my hotel room,” McDougal said, adding that seeing his home “made it more real.” McDougal said she met Melania once at an Apprentice release party at the Playboy Mansion and was even in a group photo with her. But McDougal kept her distance from the future first lady “because I felt guilty.”Cooper asked whether Melania knew of the affair. McDougal replied that she was told Trump and his wife were arguing that night. She said she asked why they were fighting, and someone told her, “Probably because of you.”“I guess if he’s doing it behind his wife’s back, why would he not do it behind my back?”McDougal said she met all of Trump’s children, except for Barron, who was only a baby.Trump often talked about how proud he was of his daughter, Ivanka, and allegedly compared McDougal to her, she said. “He’s very proud of Ivanka, as he should be. She’s a brilliant woman. She’s beautiful. That’s his daughter and he should be proud of her.“He said I was beautiful like her. And ‘You’re a smart girl.’ There wasn’t a lot of comparing, but there was some,” McDougal said. “I heard a lot about her.” McDougal said Trump’s comments about Ivanka never seemed strange. Meanwhile, Daniels’ claims that she slept with Trump at the July 2006 American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe surprised McDougal. “My first thought was, ‘How could she have been with him, when I was with him?’ The only time we weren’t together on that particular trip was when he was on the golf course golfing,” McDougal said, adding that she joined him at every event.The ex-Playmate said she remembers Trump telling her, “There were a bunch of porn stars out there. They were wanting pictures of me.” McDougal now assumes Trump had a hotel-room romp with Daniels the day McDougal left.Asked whether she wanted to marry Trump, McDougal said, “Maybe.” Trump never told her she was his only girlfriend, she said. “But I guess if he’s doing it behind his wife’s back, why would he not do it behind my back?”“I thought I was the only one,” she said. Under questioning by Cooper, McDougal said she didn’t preserve text messages or photos. “Let me just say this. If you’re in a loving relationship, do you try and collect evidence?” she replied. She only kept notes in her journal, she said. McDougal said she saw Trump a minimum of five times a month and that they were intimate “many dozens of times.” They discussed using condoms but decided against using them, she said. Eventually, she said she ended the relationship.She spoke to him again in 2009, when he got her and a boyfriend a room at the Trump hotel in Las Vegas. But she didn’t consider rekindling the relationship because he was married. “I would never do that again,” McDougal said. The fitness model said she never thought about spilling her story but that the media contacted her in 2011. “I for the life of me couldn’t figure out who would leak something like this,” McDougal said. She denied the affair.“When you have feelings in a relationship and you cared about somebody, why would you want to destroy their life any more than you might have already destroyed their life?” McDougal said of why she never tried to sell her account.But in 2016, as Trump vied for the Republican presidential nomination, McDougal said she reconsidered keeping her story secret. She said she was watching the GOP debate with her friend “Johnny”—likely John Crawford, who is named in her lawsuit—who encouraged her to go public.A week or two later, McDougal saw an old friend posting on Twitter about her relationship with Trump and decided she needed to come forward, she said.McDougal found attorney Keith Davidson, known for selling celebrity sex tapes and stories, and who she claims colluded with Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen when negotiating her hush agreement with AMI. According to McDougal, Davidson told her that her story was worth “many, many millions” and brought her to AMI. McDougal said she wanted “to get my truth out there.” She added, “I wasn’t looking for money, clearly, but when he said it’s worth many millions, I’m like, you know...” Cooper suggested the cash was hard to pass up, and McDougal replied, “Sure. But if you fast forward, I ended up not wanting to do that deal” and went to ABC News for no compensation. “It’s a lot of money, but you also have your conscience.”McDougal said she got “cold feet” about speaking to ABC News. “I wanted to keep it a very private matter, because it was private between us at the time,” McDougal said of Trump, adding that she felt a sense of loyalty. After Trump became the Republican nominee, AMI was again interested in buying the rights to McDougal’s story. Ultimately, AMI allegedly offered McDougal a fitness column and magazine covers in exchange for her silence. As previously reported, McDougal was offered $150,000, and 45 percent of the fee went to Davidson, her attorney. She said she thought it was a win: The story would be kept secret and her brand would be preserved as wholesome, and she’d also jumpstart a new magazine career.She said she didn’t realize that, behind the scenes, AMI was plotting a “catch and kill” of her story.Cooper asked if McDougal thought Trump was aware of the deal. “One of the big complaints with why I think my contract is illegal is because his attorney was talking to my attorney,” McDougal said, referring to Cohen, “without me even knowing.”When Cooper suggested Cohen shouldn’t have been involved in the agreement, since Trump wasn’t a party to the deal, McDougal agreed. “So why was he involved in my deal? And why wasn’t I told that he was involved in my deal?” McDougal said. “That’s not fair, and it’s quite frankly illegal. It’s wrong.”The contract McDougal signed was done quickly, she said. She told her attorney she’d sign it in about a week since she was going out of town, but he allegedly pressed her, saying the paperwork needed to be signed that night or the next day. Looking back, McDougal said she assumes the hush agreement was only requested because of the presidential election. Still, McDougal doesn’t believe news of the affair would have damaged Trump’s presidential hopes. “You’ve seen the other stories about him,” she said. “It didn’t hurt him. Could it have been damaging politically speaking? Probably not.” McDougal said she’s a Republican who voted for Trump and that she had no reason to damage his reputation. She was most excited about writing for health and fitness magazines, she said. She claimed she probably wouldn’t have sold her story for millions anyway. “It’s a lot of money, but you also have your conscience,” McDougal said. McDougal said she was “disgusted” by the Access Hollywood tape that revealed Trump’s infamous “grab ‘em by the pussy” comments.“I had not seen that in him at all. He was respectful, he was a gentleman,” she said, adding, “I didn’t see that side of him until I started watching TV. That’s not the man that I knew. So I was kind of disgusted.” It wasn’t just locker-room talk, she said. McDougal also said she was mortified by the many accusations of sexual misconduct against Trump. “Clearly, you know, women have their stories and their opinions, and if they were violated like that, they should come forward,” she said.Cooper brought up a recent statement from AMI, which claims it is not stopping McDougal from sharing her story. McDougal responded, “But according to their attorney, I can’t. That would be financial ruin.”Nearly a year after the election, AMI’s CEO, David Pecker, reportedly took McDougal to lunch to thank her for her loyalty. (The sit-down with Pecker, who is a buddy of Trump, was described in the New Yorker exposé, too.)When Cooper asked what Pecker meant by “loyalty,” McDougal said, “I thought to AMI. I don’t know exactly what he meant by that. But I think it’s probably maybe a combination of both. I don’t know.”McDougal feels scared and threatened, she said, but that she has to stand up for herself. “I didn’t know what was going on behind the scenes. So I’m quite mad at that. I’m angry. I feel taken advantage of, in a sense,” she said.She said she filed the lawsuit to get her “life rights back.”“I want to share my truth, because everyone else is talking about my truth. I need to share my story. Everyone else is talking about it,” she said. “I want to share my truth, because everyone else is talking about my truth. I need to share my story. Everyone else is talking about it.”McDougal said she’s offered to return the $150,000 she received from AMI. But she hinted that more could be revealed. “The story’s out there now,” McDougal said. “I’m not telling the nitty-gritty details, as you can see. I’m very selective about what I’m saying about our relationship.”She wants the promises AMI made to be fulfilled, she said. (According to her lawsuit, McDougal’s agreement called for two years of weekly posts in an online magazine, as well as monthly feature articles in print. She would also be featured on two covers.) “I’ve gotten really nothing out of this,” McDougal said, adding. “It was fake. They didn’t want to help me. I thought they wanted to keep my reputation clean, from what they said. They wanted to rebrand me.”McDougal said AMI and her lawyer made empty promises. “They keep dangling the carrot,” she said. “But I’m not playing that game anymore.”McDougal gave a nod to Daniels, saying the adult-film actress’ openness made it easier for her to come forward.Her only regret, she said, was that Trump was married. Cooper asked, “If Melania Trump was watching this, what would you want her to know?”“That’s a tough one,” McDougal said. “What can you say except, ‘I’m sorry’? I’m sorry. I wouldn’t want it done to me. I’m sorry.”"},

  'body': "In a number of races up and down the ballot in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night, progressive Democrats scored unexpected victories against incumbents and more conservative challengers. As the party has been forced to the left in its policy stances by a fervent and enthusiastic base, a number of previous races in the era of President Trump resulted in voters selecting slightly less progressive Democrats. Last week, Richard Cordray won the Ohio Democratic gubernatorial nomination against former Rep. Dennis Kucinich. And before that, Ralph Northam defeated Tom Perriello in his Virginia Democratic gubernatorial primary and was then handily elected governor. Yet there have been a host of contests indicating a desire for Democrats more befitting of the current political environment. And on Tuesday, that desire won out in some places. John Fetterman, the burly, bearded mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, won the primary for lieutenant governor, knocking off Democratic incumbent Mike Stack. Fetterman, who ran a strong Senate challenge in 2016, will now join Gov. Tom Wolf’s ticket in November. “I’m just coming at this in a low-key, overwhelmed, humbled place,” Fetterman reportedly said as he accepted the nomination. “I just want to take our message of ‘All places matter,’ and I’m so honored by the people of Pennsylvania to be the nominee for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania.”Recently, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) endorsed Fetterman and campaigned on his behalf. Voters across the state were also selecting candidates who will compete in an entirely new congressional map in November, following the state Supreme Court’s decision to throw out a previous partisan gerrymander. The new districts, more evenly divided reflecting Pennsylvania’s swing state status, provide fertile ground for Democratic hopes of gaining the majority in the House of Representatives.In one of the easiest potential pickup opportunities for the Democratic Party, the new 5th Congressional District—now represented by Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA), who resigned at the end of April following revelations that he had used taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment claim—Mary Gay Scanlon was declared the winner of the Democratic primary. Scanlon, who has a strong shot of winning the district in November, would be the only woman in the state’s current congressional delegation. But she will likely not be alone. In the other district ripe for a Democrat win in November, former Allentown solicitor Susan Wild won her primary for the new 7th Congressional District, vacated by retiring Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA). She beat out John Morganelli, a district attorney and centrist Democrat who has expressed some Trump-inclined immigration views and recently scrubbed his Twitter page of tweets supportive of the president. Wild also beat African-American pastor Greg Edwards, who had the support of Sanders and a number of progressive groups. Nowhere was the success of the left more prevalent than in the shocking statehouse victories of two members of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Summer Lee, a first-time candidate, earned 68 percent of the vote against sitting Democratic incumbent state house Rep. Paul Costa. And Sara Innamorato, the other DSA member, got 65 percent of the vote in a separate race against Costa’s cousin Dom, who was first elected almost a decade ago. Two more DSA members, Elizabeth Fiedler and Kristin Seale, also won their state house primary contests. The zeal for candidates on the left seemed to extend beyond Pennsylvania as well. In Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, the race had not been called by midnight, but Kara Eastman was narrowly leading former Rep. Brad Ashford (D-NE) in the Democratic primary. It’s a district the Democratic Party had its eyes on capturing in November, and Eastman outperformed the former congressman while campaigning on a Medicare-for-All platform.

State Rep. Rick Saccone, who lost in a shocking upset in a special election earlier this year to Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA), failed to win his primary in a new district that is even more favorable to Republicans. "},
 {'title': 'Top Trump Ally Predicts Iran Deal Will Hold Up, for Now',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "One of Donald Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill said on Thursday that he expects the president to keep the United States in compliance with the Iran nuclear deal—at least for a short period of time.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and one of the lawmakers with whom Trump speaks with most regularly, told The Daily Beast that the president would likely decline to back out entirely when a deadline to waive sanctions against Tehran comes next week.“I would not necessarily draw a foregone conclusion that we’re out this month,” Meadows said in an interview. “To suggest that it’s a foregone conclusion that we’ll be out in weeks would be inaccurate based on my conversations with some of my colleagues on Capitol Hill, both Democrat and Republican.”Meadows’ comments offer an eleventh-hour glimmer of hope for supporters of the Iran deal, most of whom have grown convinced that Trump would withdraw the U.S. from the Obama-brokered agreement. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled to Washington on a mission to persuade Trump to keep the U.S. compliant with the terms of the agreement while U.S. and European negotiators work on fixing certain provisions.“If I had to handicap it, I would believe there’d be a short-term extension as we look to re-negotiate an agreement, even though the parties to those agreements have said re-negotiation is not on the table,” said Meadows, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.According to Meadows, the president appears to be more focused on his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and trade policy with China. The conservative congressman suggested that Trump wouldn’t want a withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal to get in the way of his administration’s ongoing discussions with those two countries.“Knowing that the deadlines on some of this correspond to key discussions on trade with China and denuclearization talks with North Korea, I can see a deferral more than an outright withdrawal being a tactic that is used right now,” Meadows added.But as with all things involving the Trump White House, it could all change before the May 12 deadline for the president to decide whether to re-impose U.S. sanctions—a move that would put the U.S. in violation of the deal. Inside the White House, the perception about the Iran deal’s future is sharply, if cautiously, different from Meadow’s.Many close to Trump are treating a break from the international agreement this month as all but a done deal. Numerous sources across the administration say that senior ranks, from the West Wing to the Treasury Department, are preparing for Trump to kill the Iran deal after he repeatedly said the last certification would be the “last time” he’d do so.White House officials and Trump confidants all cautioned, however, that a decision is never final until it is final. The president has, against his instincts, signed off on recertification in the past. Still, in private conversations over the past several months, Trump has given few signals—“zero indication, zilch,” in the words of one longtime associate—that he has an appetite to remain in the Iran nuclear deal, instead complaining about how “horrible” and “pathetic” and “lousy” he views it.Many surrounding Trump at the highest levels, including newly minted national security adviser John Bolton, have told the president that the deal is beyond “fixing.” Bolton, in fact, had been urging Trump to withdraw even before officially joining the administration, and advised Trump for months in an unofficial capacity while Bolton’s predecessor had been advocating for a diametrically different approach.Congress is essentially powerless to prevent the president from killing the Obama-brokered accord. Earlier this year, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster were working closely with congressional leaders to salvage the deal by getting rid of the 60- and 90-day certification requirements. Such a move would have allowed the U.S. to quietly remain in compliance with the deal without requiring Trump to rubber-stamp something he had campaigned vehemently against and regularly disparages.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But now, the president has Mike Pompeo and John Bolton as his secretary of state and national security adviser, respectively. Both men oppose the deal and have indicated that they will move Trump in the direction of pulling the U.S. out of it ahead of the next certification deadline in nine days.Those who have spoken with the president in recent days and weeks—everyone from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) to Macron—have predicted that Trump will pull the U.S. out of the deal, hinting at a lack of progress with the U.S.-European negotiations.Meadows, for his part, did not appear to be comfortable with remaining in the deal past May 12, even as he predicted that Trump may do so. The congressman has been a vocal proponent of “shredding” the accord outright.“I think we’ve got a bigger problem. Limited sanctions are not going to bring Iran back to the table just because of our inability to have our European partners necessarily join us in that,” he said.On the other side of the debate is Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who vehemently opposed the Iran deal at its inception but now argues that it would be disastrous to withdraw from it.“As much as I dislike the agreement, if you walk away unilaterally, then what’s the follow-up?” Menendez told The Daily Beast. “What’s your plan to ensure that Iran does not achieve nuclear weapons? And what’s your plan to secure a multilateral effort to sanction Iran outside of the nuclear portfolio?”The senator outlined two scenarios whereby the U.S. decides to re-impose sanctions against European countries and entities doing business with Iran, or the U.S. opts against implementing those sanctions and the Trump administration becomes a “toothless tiger” separated from European allies. Iran has warned in recent days that it could follow suit and pull out of the accord, and its ambassador to the United Kingdom raised the possibility that Tehran resumes its uranium enrichment.“There is no real procedure for exiting the Iran deal,” warned Jarrett Blanc, a former State Department official who oversaw the certification process. “I can’t tell that they have a policy objective. This seems to be motivated by presidential animus toward his predecessor more than it is by any specific outcome.”"},

  'body': "LONDON—British political consultants that worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign said they secretly used proxy organizations and super PACs to spread ads in the U.S. that could not be traced back to the Trump campaign.Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, was secretly recorded by undercover reporters from Channel 4 in Britain who were posing as prospective clients. “There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing,” said Nix, reassuring them that his company’s dirty tricks for his clients would never be detected.Nix said Cambridge Analytica used encrypted emails that were timed to self-destruct and boasted that U.S. politicians on the congressional committees weren’t smart enough to catch him out. “They’re politicians, they’re not technical. They don’t understand,” he said.Nix claimed they had overseen much of the Trump presidential campaign, we “ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.”He said he had met Trump “many times.”One of Cambridge Analytica’s biggest investors and board members, Republican super-donor \xa0Rebekah Mercer, told The Daily Beast Monday that she was standing by the company after it was accused of misusing 50 million harvested Facebook profiles. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, was another former investor and board member.The company’s managing director, Mark Turnbull, told the undercover reporters that they had created something called the “Defeat Crooked Hillary” ad campaign. Turnbull: “The brand was ‘Defeat Crooked Hillary’. You’ll remember this of course? ‘Crooked Hillary’ - and the zeros, the OO of crooked were a pair of hand-cuffs and it was all about….”Reporter: “Like prisoner?”Turnbull: “She belongs behind bars…”Reporter: “And you have created this?”Turnbull: “Defeat Crooked Hillary.

The website said it was a special project of Make America Number 1, a super PAC reportedly funded by the Mercer family, who bankrolls Cambridge Analytica.A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica said that the company “has been completely transparent about our simultaneous work on both political campaigns and political action committees (including publicly declaring our work on both with FEC filings). We have strict firewall practises to ensure no coordination between regulated groups, including the teams working on non-coordinated campaigns being physically separated, using different servers and being banned from communicating with each other.” \xa0Minutes before Channel 4 broadcast aired in the U.K., Cambridge Analytica suspended Nix as CEO pending an investigation into his work.Dr. Alex Tayler, the company’s chief data scientist, was recorded explaining how campaigns could secretly direct other organizations to spread their message. “Sometimes you can use proxy organisations who are already there. You feed them. They are civil society organizations… Charities or activist groups, and we use them—feed them the material and they do the work,” he said. “So this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands but with no branding—so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”Over the weekend it was claimed that Cambridge Analytica had misused data harvested from 50 million Facebook profiles to calibrate their message and target U.S. voters who might be susceptible.Christopher Wylie, a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, said they had been testing slogans such as “drain the swamp” and “build that wall,” as early as 2014. “We were testing these narratives well before Trump even announced,” he told CNN. “We were finding there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to. Steve Bannon knew that, because we were doing the research on it.”Nix, who appeared before the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017, told the undercover reporters that there was no need to worry about Congressional oversight. \xa0He said the Republican members asked just three questions. “After five minutes—done.” “They’re politicians, they’re not technical. They don’t understand how it works,” he said, explaining that the Democrats were a little more persistent—questioning him for two hours—because they were motivated by “sour grapes.”On Monday, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, called for Nix and his colleagues to return to the Hill for a rematch."},
 {'title': 'Pro-Trump Author Says CIA Has Plan to Kill the President',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "It is not difficult to conclude that we now have a conspiracy theorist as president of the United States. During Barack Obama’s presidency Donald Trump promised to find proof that he was not born in the United States and claimed that he had sent people to Hawaii to find the evidence. If he really sent anyone, they never came back with the proof Trump expected. Then in March 2017, as president, he tweeted that Obama had ordered a wiretap on his phone at Trump Tower. That too was false. Of late, Trump has engaged in several “tweet storms” claiming that a conspiracy by the “Deep State” exists and is doing all it can to delegitimize his presidency and get him removed from office. Trump believes the Deep State was instituted by John Brennan, Obama’s CIA director, and includes all of the intelligence agencies. His latest claim is that before leaving office the Obama team planted an FBI spy in his campaign, tweeting a phrase his supporters would soon repeat: “SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!”Contrary to being SPYGATE, it is becoming apparent that the FBI source (since exposed as academic Stefan Halper) was not put into Trump’s campaign for political purposes but was part of a legitimate counterintelligence operation investigating Russia’s election interference in the U.S. elections and involved three of his campaign aides, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis, whom Halper interviewed. Trump evidently believes that Halper’s interviews were an attempt to entrap his advisers to plant evidence about Russian collusion. All of this is to be expected, because this is Donald Trump’s modus vivendi. What is more troubling, however, is that many intellectual Trump supporters are echoing the president and are making the same arguments. Roger Kimball, head of Encounter Books and editor of The New Criterion (for which I have written), argues like Trump that it was Brennan who put together a “working group… to stymie Trump’s campaign.” He concludes that a “cabal of CIA and FBI operatives, including the director of the CIA, John Brennan, along with other members of the intelligence ‘community’ prominently including James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, and various members of the Obama administration, colluded to undermine Donald Trump’s campaign.” The cabal, he believes, still exists. Now, Kimball writes, this group has shifted to “a desperate attempt to destroy his presidency.” “Up to this point, Corsi’s book reads as a rehash of all the claims regularly made daily about the conspiracy by Trumpists. But he takes this one original, and scurrilous, step further.”Kimball gives Trump’s tweets intellectual credibility. He goes to the extent of writing that “What is being exposed is the biggest political scandal in the history of the United States: the effort by highly placed—exactly how highly placed we still do not know—members of one administration to mobilize the intelligence services and police power of the state to spy upon and destroy first the candidacy and then, when that didn’t work, the administration of a political rival.”And another prominent intellectual, the distinguished historian Victor Davis Hanson, writes that “If there is such a thing as a dangerous ‘deep state’ of elite but unelected federal officials who feel that they are untouchable and unaccountable, then John Brennan is the poster boy.” He adds that “Brennan is typical of the careerist deep state.” They operate “the psychological tactic known as ‘projection.’ To square their own circles of lying, our so-called best and brightest loudly accuse others of precisely the sins that they themselves commit as a matter of habit.”Of course, the real reason for this narrative is, as Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes write in Lawfare, “to protect the president from a properly predicated counterintelligence investigation involving the activity of an adversary foreign power.” What we now have is an assault on the very institutions whose members seek to protect us: the FBI, the CIA and other intelligence agencies. And rather than protect sources who work for them and believe that their identities will be protected, the president and members of Congress, especially Devin Nunes, out their names—much in the same manner the far leftist rogue ex-CIA agent Philip Agee did in the 1960s, endangering the lives of many brave agents and individuals who cooperate with U.S. intelligence.No one, however, has gone as far as Jerome R. Corsi, the self-proclaimed “investigative reporter” whose book during John Kerry’s presidential campaign, the “Swiftboating” of his Vietnam War record, badly damaged Kerry’s campaign, although the charges were false.He is the same man who in 2012 wrote a column claiming Obama is a homosexual. This is the same Corsi who argued he had proof of Obama’s Kenyan birth, and that a pattern on a ring Obama wore proved that he was a secret Muslim. Corsi has a Ph.D. from Harvard and uses that credential to assert that his words have credibility.Corsi is Washington correspondent for conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ Infowars. Recently, he appeared on C-Span’s book show Afterwords, where he talked about his new book, Killing the Deep State. In a nutshell, here is how Corsi describes his thesis: “The central premise of this book is that President Trump is the target of a coup d’état being undertaken by the Deep State, including the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies that maintain a commitment to a globalist New World Order.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.From the moment Trump won, Corsi believes the “deep state” promised to interfere with his presidency, beginning with the NSA and Brennan at CIA placing Trump under electronic surveillance. Brennan, along with John Podesta, Corsi claims, began the story about “Russian collusion” to delegitimize the campaign. Robert Mueller was made special counsel because he is “a partisan deep state operative with close ties to FBI Director James Comey.” The deep state, Corsi believes, is seeking to force Trump to resign. If that doesn’t work, it plans to move to “impeachment or a charge under the 25th Amendment that he is mentally incompetent.” Up to this point, Corsi’s book reads as a rehash of all the claims regularly made daily about the conspiracy by Trumpists. But he takes this one original, and scurrilous, step further. Should that not work, he claims, the deep state operatives have one measure left to take, and that is “‘executive action’—a CIA plan to assassinate Trump… the deep state’s last resort.”This Corsi book does not have a mainstream publisher, as one of his earlier ones did. Instead, it has been published by a book division of the far right-wing Newsmax, run by Trump’s friend Christopher Ruddy. The company is carrying on a campaign to push his book, sending out to its lists a 12-page magazine-size flier on its behalf. The flier says the book proves that there is underway a “coup d’état to take out President Trump,” orchestrated by Obama and his lieutenants. The publisher claims that although the book is a best-seller, The New York Times made a decision to leave it off its list, although for one week it begrudgingly listed it, under pressure, as No. 15, the last number on the paper’s list.Best-seller or not, Corsi’s narrative is a compendium of all the conspiracy theories put together and is bound to be a basic source for Trump’s defenders, who are taking out the crude edges and using his analysis as the standard for showing why Trump’s presidency must be defended at all costs against the nefarious deep state. In today’s polarized climate, the more that narrative is spread and adopted, the more it poses a serious threat to our democracy."},
 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Doesn’t Care About Scandals Because He’s on a Mission from God',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Another week, another set of scandals for embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.This time, it’s the sudden resignation of two of his most controversial aides: security head Pasquale Perrotta and Albert Kelly. Perrotta was allegedly responsible for Pruitt’s $43,000 telephone booth and unprecedented eight-man security detail. Kelly was a banker, barred from the finance industry for life due to an illegal loan agreement, who in 2003 helped Pruitt secure a mortgage on a home valued at nearly $500,000, despite the fact that Pruitt was at the time a state senator making a $38,400 salary. Kelly was put in charge of the Superfund program, despite having no experience in the field.At the same time, The Washington Post revealed that Pruitt’s $100,000 taxpayer-funded trip to Morocco was arranged by a lobbyist who subsequently won a huge lobbying contract for the Moroccan government. That’s almost certain to run afoul of government ethics rules, and if an investigation is launched, it will be the 12th of Pruitt to be ongoing.By now, it’s generally agreed that Pruitt still has his job because he is “too crooked to fail.” He is the crucial pipeline (no pun intended) between the fossil fuel industry and the Trump administration and is a deregulatory hero. So despite having vastly exceeded the ethical lapses for which other Trump officials have been fired, Pruitt has so far endured.But at the center of Pruitt is a paradox: It seems as though there are three Scott Pruitts, who coexist in the same body but contradict one another at every turn.The first Pruitt is an oil industry pawn, hell-bent on making it easier to burn oil, pollute the air, and evade government sanction. This is the Scott Pruitt who cut and paste industry talking points into his own statements when he was attorney general of Oklahoma. But that Pruitt has been undermined by the second Scott Pruitt, an amateur grifter who can’t keep his nose clean. If Pruitt were smart, he’d be like Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, who has quietly destroyed the agency he is running. Mulvaney has been effective because his name isn’t in the papers. Why has Pruitt been so dumb as to save a few bucks on rent by getting a below-market sweetheart deal from a lobbyist? It seems like a mystery.“If Pruitt were smart, he’d be like Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, who has quietly destroyed the agency he is running. Mulvaney has been effective because his name isn’t in the papers.”And then there’s the third Pruitt, the pious Christian, the deacon of his Baptist church in Oklahoma, the trustee of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. How does a man so dedicated to conservative Christianity have 11 investigations into his unethical behavior? Well, stay with me here, because I think it all fits together if you understand his theology. I am going to share with you the Grand Unified Theory of Scott Pruitt.“The biblical world view with respect to these [environmental’ issues is that we have a responsibility to manage and cultivate, harvest the natural resources that we’ve been blessed with to truly bless our fellow mankind.” That’s Scott Pruitt three months ago, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network’s David Brody.In contrast, Pruitt continued, “the ‘environmental Left’ tells us that, though we have natural resources like natural gas and oil and coal, and though we can feed the world, we should keep those things in the ground, put up fences and be about prohibition.” “That’s wrongheaded,” he concluded, “and I think it’s counter to what we should be about.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.This contrast, between Christian “harvesting” of natural resources and Environmentalist “prohibition,” is a longstanding belief among conservative Christians, including Southern Baptists, evangelicals, and conservative Catholics. The predominant belief—though of course there are many diverse points of view—is that nature is here to serve humankind. “Fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over… every living thing that moves upon the earth,” says Genesis 1:28.To be sure, Christian environmentalists point out that good “dominion” entails care, stewardship, and ensuring that the earth remains for the next generation—not exploiting natural resources to the point that they are depleted and the skies and waters are fouled.But for at least half a century, since the birth of the modern environmental movement, the dominant view among Christian conservatives is that man is special and that the earth’s resources are here for us to use, now, for the benefit of people. To “keep those things in the ground”—because burning them disrupts the climate, or causes water pollution, or destroys natural ecosystems—is to disobey God’s command. Worse than that: Environmentalism is paganism, placing human beings on equal footing with the rest of the natural world, rather than above it.That’s how the third, Christian Pruitt coexists with the first, oil-soaked Pruitt. In his worldview, God wants you to use as many natural resources as you can. God wants you to pollute.But what about that second Pruitt, the self-enriching grifter? Actually, he’s part of the very same worldview.From the outside, the alliance of Christian conservatives and Republican plutocrats may seem like a marriage of convenience. But on the inside, it’s much more than that: Free-market ideals have permeated conservative Christian culture; notwithstanding everything Jesus says like “blessed are the poor” and “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” In postwar America, God wants you to be rich.This theology ranges from the “Prosperity Gospel,” which holds that the more you believe in God, the wealthier you will be, to beliefs that free enterprise capitalism is the only Christian economic system, and that America has drifted away from its Christian roots (in terms of moral values and economic ones) and into illegitimacy.Pruitt (like George W. Bush) believes he has been divinely ordained to restore God’s moral-political order to America. “I spent a couple years just earnestly praying, asking the question that I don’t think we ask enough, God what do you want to do with me?'” Pruitt told Brody. “It was actually Isaiah chapter one that I was reading through at that time… where God says to Israel, ‘I will restore your leaders as in the days of old, your judges as at the beginning.’ And there was just a desire that welled up in me to say, ‘I want to be like those leaders that we had at our founding, at the inception of our country.’”What are some minor legalities like lying to Congress about using a private email server for public business, or giving two favorite aides a raise over the White House’s objection (and then lying about that too)? Pruitt is on a mission from God to make America great again.All of the threads hang together. The grifter Pruitt is the Christian Pruitt is the anti-environmentalist Pruitt, chosen by God to restore His plan of laissez-faire capitalism and the unfettered exploitation of natural resources. No wonder he responded with such petulance when a Fox News interviewer pressed him on his misdeeds. How can any of that nonsense compare with a divine mandate to restore Divine priorities to our government?Scott Pruitt is a man on a divine mission. He deserves that fancy house he shouldn’t be able to afford, that eight-person security detail, those petty favors from lobbyists. After all, the lobbyists are also all fulfilling God’s plan, and the rules Pruitt’s broken are part of a fallen state. But beware of Proverbs 16:18, Administrator Pruitt: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”"},
 {'title': 'RNC’s Comey Attacks Are Right out of the Dictators’ Playbook',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When wtf moments happen at the pace they have in the age of Trump, it gets tough to sort out which outrages really matter. When we do encounter a stand-out moment, we need to take notice. And I say we’re in one now. When future historians write the dystopian timeline of how we lost the republic under Trump, they’ll make special note of this current campaign by the Republican National Committee to smear James Comey.If you haven’t gone to http://lyincomey.com, I suggest you do so. No; scratch that. You don’t need to. Don’t give them the traffic. Just ponder what it means that the RNC has now gone into full Trump mode—everyone who deals with him gets dragged down to his level eventually, or drags themselves down voluntarily—in attacking a lifelong Republican and lifelong prosecutor who has spent his career doing what Republicans used to want G-men like Comey to do: put the bad guys in jail.This is straight-up caudillismo—unquestioning subservience to the strong man, of the sort heretofore seen in places like Nicaragua under the Somozas or the Philippines under Marcos. It’s not that I wouldn’t expect the RNC to defend Trump. I would. It’s the way they’re doing it. The abject genuflection, even to the point of adopting his way of speaking (Lyin’ Comey). In its obvious effort to please the big man, stay on his good side, it has that whiff of totalitarian quaking about it, like the men who wrote the headlines at Pravda back in the 1930s, choosing each verb with the greatest care lest they run afoul of Uncle Joe.There is no American precedent for this level of tremulous psycho-submission. There is precedent for knife-fighting, sure. That’s politics. When Richard Nixon was president and the Watergate screws were beginning to tighten, the RNC remained 100 percent loyal to Nixon.The RNC chairman at the time, which few people remember now, was George H.W. Bush. I don’t want to say anything too bad about the poor man under current circumstances, but I will note that Bush was a huge Nixon defender, and that at one point he tried to launch a p.r. campaign to besmirch the reputation of the chief Democratic investigator on the Watergate committee, a man named Carmine Bellino.Not many people touched the story at the time, and few journalists have dug deep into Poppy’s tenure at the RNC. So it was left to Kitty Kelley, in her saucy and controversial biography of the Bush family, to tell the tale. In late July 1973, right after the Watergate committee subpoenaed the president to turn over the tapes, Bush held a press conference to accuse Bellino of having bugged the Washington hotel where, in 1960, Nixon had been preparing for his debates with John Kennedy. Afterward, writes Kelley, 22 Republicans stepped up to demand an investigation.One was commenced, and Bellino was cleared. But it took two and a half months. Bush stayed loyal to Nixon to the bitter end, Kelley writes, noting that Bush sent a letter to Nixon calling on him to resign—after White House chief of staff Al Haig had told Bush that Nixon had already decided to do so! So that is what party leaders do. They’re lackeys. On the Democratic side, too. But what RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel—actually, that’s Ronna Romney McDaniel, and she is Mitt’s niece—is of a different order. She is going out of her way these days to praise Trump as a moral leader. “The actions of this president show that he is a moral leader because he is working for the American people and pushing back on monsters like Bashar al-Assad,” she told CNN. I have no love for Comey. He helped hand the election to Trump, and I suspect he knows that he bears some of the responsibility for putting a totally unprincipled man in the White House, and he’s trying to arrange things so that when the day comes, the lead paragraph in his Times obituary won’t mention that. Why he felt compelled to announce publicly that he was reopening the Clinton case while continuing to conceal the fact that the bureau was investigating the Trump campaign will remain a mystery. As former Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub tweeted, referring to former GOP Congressman Jason Chaffetz, who went public with the news of the reopened Clinton probe: “Comey had to know Chaffetz would leak the letter on the reopened Clinton investigation. But if Comey had written, ‘This is to inform you that the FBI is investigating both major party presidential candidates,’ Chaffetz would’ve dug a 6-foot hole and buried it in the forest. So...”If Comey had done that, the man he suspects may have watched prostitutes take golden showers and is susceptible to Russian blackmail would likely be back to swindling contractors rather than the country and the world. Why didn’t he? Well, in April 2017, The New York Times did a huge after-the-fact tick-tock on why Comey went public the previous October, written by four of the paper’s investigative aces. It included the sentence: “Fearing the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the FBI had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret, Mr. Comey sent a letter informing Congress that the case was reopened.” [italics mine.]Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'GOP Rep: The ‘Deep State’ is Responsible for Ordering Ben Carson’s Dining Set',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) appeared to blame the nefarious “Deep State” for ordering a costly dining set for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson. During a recent appearance on Talk! Of the Town, an upstate New York local radio show, the New York Republican was asked about the decision to buy a $31,000 dining room set for Carson’s office last year. Tenney told the hosts that the “Ben Carson story is so misunderstood” before pointing to a no-named staffer of cryptic origin as the culprit. “First of all, I like Ben Carson a lot. I think he’s really trying to do a great job there. But his staffer, one of his key people, was in my office the other day to talk about some of the housing issues that we have in our region and we were talking about that and he said ‘you know, that’s the most…” Tenney said trailing off. “Somebody in the Deep State, it was not one of his people apparently, ordered a table, like a conference room table or whatever it was for a room,” Tenney continued. “And that’s what the cost was. Ben Carson tried to—he said “you know how hard it is to turn it back because of the way that the procurement happens?”The “Deep State” is a catch all phrase for the cadre of career government staffers that conspiratorial-minded Republicans believe has been weaponized to undermine Donald Trump’s administration. It was not clear if Tenney was agreeing with the conclusion offered by the staffer that the Deep State was behind Carson’s furniture purchase or if she was offering her own line of thinking on the matter. Either way, Tenney’s statement appears to be wrong. A tranche of recently-released emails indicated that Carson and his wife were directly involved in the process of picking out furniture. Carson testified about the matter before the House Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, saying that he left a bulk of a decision-making on the purchase to his wife and other aides. “I invited my wife to come and help,” Carson said. “I left it to my wife, you know, to choose something. I dismissed myself from the issues.”He contended that both he and his wife were unhappy with the price tag. Later in her interview, Tenney was pressed by the hosts as to why such an expensive order took place at all, questioning whether it was nepotism that had something to do with it. “Nepotism is when you hire a family member,” Tenney corrected them. “What it is is that people in the Deep State who’ve been there, they might be—they say ‘hey we’re going to buy this because this is what somebody else did.’ “I know that Ben Carson did not order that table,” Tenney continued. “It has nothing to do with him. He comes from, you know, poverty.”Tenney is quickly gathering a reputation for headline-grabbing commentary about the state of current affairs. She recently said of former staff secretary Rob Porter, who left the White House after being accused of domestic abuse: “I don’t think it was a great hire if these are true, but again, are these true?” She also recently described it as “interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Trump Is About to Get a Dose of Due Process From Summer Zervos',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'After aide Rob Porter departed the White House amid accusations he had physically abused two ex-wives, President Trump tweeted a question: “Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?” Well, Trump is about to get a dose of it. On Tuesday, a Manhattan judge dismissed Trump’s effort to deny due process for Summer Zervos, ruling she can go ahead with Case 150522/2017. That is the suit in which Zervos charges\xa0Trump defamed her by calling her a liar. She was one of more than a dozen women who accused him of groping and or kissing them.Trump had sought through his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, to block the suit, arguing in December that a sitting president cannot be sued in state court. Kasowitz further argued that Trump was too busy leading the free world, and that Trump’s remarks were “political speech” covered by the First Amendment.In an uncommonly clear 18-page ruling three months in careful making, Judge Jennifer Schechter rejected all that. She offered a simple principle that is a pillar of America’s true greatness.“No one is above the law,” Schechter wrote.She cited Clinton v. Jones, the Supreme Court decision allowing Paula Jones to proceed with a federal sexual harassment lawsuit against then-President Bill Clinton.“The President of the United States has no immunity and is ‘subject to the laws’ for purely private acts,” Schechter wrote in summarizing the Supreme Court ruling.She concluded, “In the end, there is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying civil action related purely to unofficial conduct because defendant is President of the United States.”The case will go ahead, and Trump may find himself being deposed under oath about Zervos’ allegations of sexual assault. That puts the Zervos case in a whole other league than the Stormy Daniels scandal, which involves only consensual sex with a woman who took money not to talk and now wants to talk. And Zervos cannot be bought off. She is only seeking $2,914 in damages, so she is not after a monetary settlement. She wants either an admission or a jury verdict.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In her ruling on Zervos v. Trump, Schechter found further legal grounds for Zervos’ particular suit by citing a New York State Court of Appeals case which held that a college basketball coach was liable for branding two players money-hungry liars for accusing one of his staff of molesting them. “In Davis v Boeheim, the Court of Appeals determined that a defamation action could be maintained against a defendant who called individuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse liars and stated that he believed that they were motivated by money to go public,” Schechter wrote.In that case, the plaintiffs did not have to prove they had been molested to establish that they had been defamed. They needed only to show they had not come forward simply seeking personal gain as the coach alleged.Schechter cites in her decision Trump’s repeated accusations that Zervos and the other women had come forward either seeking fame or at the instigation of the Hillary Clinton campaign.As the decision notes, Trump tweeted that the allegations were “totally made up nonsense to steal the election.”The decision further quotes Trump at an October, 2016 rally in Pennsylvania:"Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All these liars will be sued after the election is over.”Trump is now the one being sued and the judge notes that Zervos need not prove that he groped her in the hotel room. She need only show that her version was not completely fabricated and that he has no basis for saying she harbored ulterior motives in making the accusations.“Defendant—the only person other than plaintiff who knows what happened between the two of them—repeatedly accused plaintiff of dishonesty not just in his opinion but as a matter of fact,” the judge notes. “He not only averred that plaintiff told ‘phony stories’ and issued statements that were ‘totally false’ and ‘fiction,’ he insisted that the events ‘never happened’ and that the allegations were ‘100% false [and] made up.’”One witness or bit of evidence establishing that Zervos was in that hotel room — for instance a receipt that would confirm the claim in her suit that he ordered one very expensive club sandwich for the two of them — and Trump likely loses, no matter what happened there.Schechter rejects any argument that Trump was just engaging in “political speech” that is protected by the Constitution.“That defendant\'s statements about plaintiff\'s veracity were made while he was campaigning to become President of the United States, does not make them any less actionable,” the decision says.She said, he lied.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Our new national security adviser, John Bolton, was born on the same day in 1948 as Weyman Cook, Jerry Miller, and Richard Lassiter, whose own chances for future achievements ended when they were killed in Vietnam. Their common birthday was Nov. 20, number 185 in the 1969 draft lottery, which was based on date of birth and ended student deferments—such as the one Bolton had until then enjoyed at Yale. He might well have been called up, as the draft went up to 195, but he managed to get a spot in the Maryland National Guard and then a local Army reserve unit. The Guard and the Reserves had long waiting lists, as they offered a way to avoid being sent to Vietnam. “I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy,” Bolton wrote in his Yale 25th reunion class book. “I considered the war in Vietnam already lost.”Instead, Bolton went to Yale Law School, interning in the summer for the stridently pro-war Vice President Spiro Agnew, who told everybody that the fight in Vietnam was progressing far better than the effete media suggested. Bolton later served at no peril in the Justice Department and the State Department, all the while being quick to recommend the use of military force. He was an ardent supporter of the Iraq War and has gained a reputation for being ever ready, almost eager to send others into combat.We will never know what Cook, Miller, and Lassiter might have accomplished. Cook had seemed like he might be one of the lucky ones after a helicopter he was in went down in Vinh Long on March 6, 1969. The married 20-year-old from Corinth, Mississippi, miraculously survived and stepped away unhurt. He could have just stood there with his whole young life before him.But a number of comrades were trapped in the burning wreckage and in his last minutes he demonstrated that he possessed the stuff of greatness. The citation of the Soldier’s Medal he was subsequently awarded “for exceptionally valorous actions while serving as crew chief of a UH-1D helicopter” reads: “The aircraft developed flight difficulties and crashed to the ground, \tbursting into flames upon impact. He managed to remove himself from the helicopter unharmed. As soon as he realized that the others were still trapped inside the burning aircraft, he rushed into the flames and pulled one of the survivors from the wreckage. As a result of his heroic action, Specialist Fourth Class Cook was severely burned and later succumbed to these fatal wounds.”Cook was buried in Oak Hill Church of Christ Cemetery in Alcorn County, Mississippi. He was preceded in death by 19-year-old Cpl. Jerry Miller, who died on Sept. 9, 1968, in Binh Thuan province.Miller had previously been wounded and knocked unconscious by an enemy rocket. He awoke to see that a number of his comrades were more seriously injured and he radioed for assistance. He insisted that the responding medics help the others first and pitched in to assist despite his own wound. He was subsequently awarded a Bronze Star, but he declined to accept it.“He believed you only get out of life what you put into it,” his mother, Jean Cornett, was later quoted saying. “He just didn’t think he had done more than anyone else would have.”A month later, Miller was on patrol when somebody in his squad failed to see a trip wire. The explosion killed Miller instantly. He is buried in Resthaven Memory Gardens Cemetery in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Another soldier born on Nov. 20, 1948, was a hero of another kind even before he was drafted. PFC Richard Lassiter, of Norfolk, Virginia, was the oldest of nine children raised by a single mother after their father deserted the family and moved to New York. Lassiter had stepped in to become the man of the house when not much more than a youngster.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

We depended on him.”He was nicknamed “Joe Nose” because of his prominent nose. The more notable bigness about him was the magnitude of his presence, which turned sparkling with what his sister calls “a 100-watt smile.” He seemed larger than life, not only a man, but also a man to emulate although only a teen.“To see him in person, he was formidable,” his sister recalled. “He was beloved by men and women. Women loved him, the guys wanted to be him and wanted to be his friend.” Then came an induction notice from the Norfolk draft board. He headed off to Vietnam predicting he would not survive to see his mother and eight siblings again.“He actually said, ‘I’m not going to come back home,’” the sister remembered. “Of course, everybody said, ‘No, no, you will.’”On May 5, 1969, Lassiter’s unit embarked on a patrol in Quang Ngai province. He advised a comrade named Don DePina not to “walk point,” as taking the lead was called.“He was the one who told me to take the ‘pig’ [walk further back], where I was less likely to be shot instead of walking point,” DePina would say in a remembrance posted online as part of a Virginia veterans project.\xa0 Lassiter himself then took the lead.“He was walking the point when we were ambushed,” DePina would recall. Lassiter’s sister, Pauline, was 11 at the time. She remembers being taken out of school and coming home to see soldiers were there, talking to her mother.“I remember my mother breaking down and everybody was crying,” she told The Daily Beast. Lassiter was buried at Hampton National Cemetery in Hampton, Virginia. His mother sought to keep going however she could.“Right after Richard died, she took up word puzzles,” Pauline recalled. “Some people go to therapy. She would do these word puzzles and would zone out.”The oldest sister, Virginia, was 15 at the time. She subsequently joined the Air Force. She became pregnant at 19 after her first sexual experience and chose to have the baby. She went into labor at Portsmouth Naval Medical Center, which bungled a spinal tap and failed to have a crash cart on hand to revive her. She was left in a perpetual coma, paralyzed, unable to speak. The mother had lost her oldest son and now had all but lost her oldest daughter.“They were just like the soul,” Pauline recalled. “They were it… It’s like the family died.”Virginia’s baby girl did survive and is now a CPA with a master’s degree, raising two kids of her own in Chicago. And Richard Lassiter’s friend from Vietnam returned home to serve as the director of veteran’s services in New Bedford, Massachusetts, from 1999 to 2002. He recorded the remembrance of Lassiter that was posted online.“Richie was my friend,” DePina said. “I will always remember Richie as my bother. I love you and your name is spoken by me every day.”DePina continued to help combat vets however he could while going to work as a cab driver. He was murdered in a robbery by two teens, aged 18 and 16, in November of 2015. He had hoped aloud in his remembrance of Lassiter that he would be reunited with his friend when his own time came. “God bless, and I will see you. Don.”Others who were born on Nov. 20, 1948, who died in Vietnam include Heinrich Ruhlmann, Leonard Deinlein, Jorge Luis Mendez-Matos, and Rene Buller.\xa0 And John Bolton lives on to become our new super-hawk national security adviser. Neither he nor his office responded on Monday to a request for comment about a time when he faced actually being in a war. Maybe he was too busy in the first official day of his latest achievement in a future such as was violently denied those other young men born on Nov. 20, 1948.“They never got a chance,” Richard Lassiter’s sister, Pauline, told The Daily Beast.\xa0\xa0\xa0 "},

The Washington Post reported that Mueller is interested in potential efforts at the Seychelles meeting to set up a backchannel between the Trump administration and the Kremlin. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment. Reached for comment, Prince spokesperson Marc Cohen did not dispute this reporting. “Erik gave a full and frank public account of events as they concern him to the intelligence committee and he has nothing else to add on this topic,” Cohen said. As Cohen noted, this isn’t the first time Prince has faced questions related to potential coordination between President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin. On Nov. 30, 2017, he spoke at length with the House intelligence committee about the campaign (PDF). The committee released the transcript of Prince’s interview, where he described his conversation with Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev. Prince told the committee that they discussed trade and terrorism. “I met him at a hotel bar, and we chatted on topics ranging from oil and commodity prices to how much his country wished for resumption of normal trade relations with the—relationship with the USA,” Prince told the committee. “I remember telling him if Franklin Roosevelt could work with Josef Stalin to defeat Nazi fascism, then certainly Donald Trump could work with Vladimir Putin to defeat Islamic fascism.“The meeting ended after a maximum of 30 minutes,” Prince continued. “I’ve had no communications or dealings with him or any of his colleagues before or after that encounter last January. That’s really all there is to say about that meeting.”What Prince didn’t note was that Lebanese-American businessman George Nader also attended the meeting, according to the Post. The paper reported that Nader is now cooperating with the special counsel probe, and has met with investigators “numerous times.” The Post reported last April that the meeting’s organizers were interested in discussing Persian Gulf politics. “Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions,” the paper reported. Prince is well-connected in Trump World. He donated $250,000 to pro-Trump efforts during the campaign, and his sister, Betsy DeVos, is Trump’s education secretary. Prince pushed hard—and unsuccessfully—for the administration to change its Afghanistan War strategy to rely on military contracting companies—the kind of firms that have made him a fortune. Prince is also close with former White House adviser Steve Bannon and has made numerous appearances on Breitbart’s radio show. But those relationships have not always resulted in Prince getting what he wants. Blackwater insiders have lambasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions to The Daily Beast (calling him a “big, giant wussy”) for the continued legal targeting of a Blackwater contractor over the killing of civilians in Iraq.

The New York Times reported last week that Mueller’s team has questioned Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, revealed on Tuesday that Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, received a payment from a Vekselberg-linked company in the wake of the campaign. The Daily Beast confirmed Avenatti’s charge. And the AP reported that Mueller has also questioned Tom Barrack, a billionaire businessman who is close friends with the president. "},

  'body': 'Following reports of a shooting at YouTube’s headquarters Tuesday afternoon, a Republican congressman almost immediately speculated that the perpetrator “could be” an undocumented immigrant.Appearing on the Fox Business Network to discuss immigration policy, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) was asked by host David Asman to pivot to discussing the shooting in San Bruno, California.The congressman’s take was to connect the shooting—without a shred of evidence—to the Bay Area’s liberal immigration enforcement.“You were going to talk to me about sanctuary cities and the sanctuary state movement, and it fits right into what you are talking about right now,” Rohrabacher said, in a clip first spotted by ThinkProgress. “Would anyone be surprised?”The lawmaker blasted the state of California for failing to deal with the scourge of “criminal illegal aliens.”Rohrabacher then continued: “Would anyone listening to you right now think, ‘Well, this certainly wouldn’t be an illegal immigrant there’? Well it could be!”He ranted that “any illegal in this state should be sent back whether he’s a criminal or not.”The Fox host did not push back on the congressman’s unproven connection between the shooting and illegal immigration. Instead, Asman replied: “Congressman, you bring up an excellent point.”'},
 {'title': '‘Was He Supposed To Do That?’: White House Scrambles as Rudy Giuliani ‘Pulls a Trump’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Even for a White House defined by intense disorder, the tumult kicked up by Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday night and Thursday morning has been viewed internally as staggering.In one softball interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Wednesday, President Donald Trump’s new lawyer managed to contradict his new client’s public statements, potentially open him up to new legal jeopardy, undercut weeks’ worth of strategy and communications devised by Trump’s senior staff, and do it all without consulting, and to the utter bewilderment of, top officials in the West Wing.Some of those senior aides watched Giuliani’s interview in real time wondering what the hell was going on.“Was he supposed to do that?” one blindsided White House official said, when asked about Giuliani’s comments on Wednesday evening shortly after the interview aired.It’s still not entirely clear what the answer is. Giuliani’s comments provided little additional clarity and culminated in even more drama: an NBC News report that the feds had tapped the phones of Michael Cohen, President Trump’s besieged personal attorney and longtime fixer who also recently gave legal advice to Hannity. Even Giuliani was caught off guard by that bit of news, prompting him to insist that it couldn’t possibly be true. “Us lawyers have talked about it, we don’t believe it’s true,” the former New York City mayor told The Daily Beast in a phone conversation on Thursday. “We think it’s going to turn out to be untrue because it would be totally illegal. You can’t wiretap a lawyer, you certainly can’t wiretap his client who’s not involved in the investigation.” Giuliani was correct, though not necessarily on the merits. Recordings of attorney-client communications are admissible under certain circumstances, as Giuliani surely knows. As a U.S. attorney in the late 1980s, he successfully used such recordings to prosecute high-ranking members of the Italian mob.Wiretapping etiquette aside, Thursday’s media blitz by the former New York City mayor marked another day in the life in a Trump era peppered by internal chaos erupting into public view. And the scramble among aides to provide a semblance of order to the madness only exposed the deep holes that remain among the president’s political and legal operations. Giuliani appeared, at times, to be flying completely solo, albeit with the president’s blessing. He upended weeks of White House talking points by claiming that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 in hush money he paid to porn star Stormy Daniels in October 2016. Neither White House counsel Don McGahn nor Emmet Flood, who joined Trump’s legal team this week, were aware of that fact until Giuliani blurted it out, according to a Thursday report from The Washington Post.Giuliani went on to insist that Cohen’s payments to Daniels were merely personal expenses unrelated to the election. But by Thursday morning, he intimated that the opposite was true. “Imagine if that came out of October 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton,” he said on Trump’s favorite morning program, Fox & Friends. “Cohen made it go away. He did his job.”Senior White House staffers were forced to watch Giuliani’s media rounds to stay apprised of the latest developments in the controversy. One senior Trump aide bluntly assessed, “Rudy pulls a Trump,” denoting a surprising, extremely public undercutting of official strategy and messaging.By Thursday, the extent to which the rest of the White House staff had been left utterly in the dark became clear. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that Giuliani’s admission was the first she’d heard of Trump repaying Cohen. (In early March, Sanders said she wasn’t aware of Trump knowing about the hush money when Cohen paid it. Last month, when Trump was asked on Air Force One, “did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” the president replied: “No.”)Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Forced to adapt to a changing storyline, White House allies and media surrogates began suggesting that there was a hidden brilliance to the former New York mayor’s performance. The Giuliani interview, former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), a prominent Trump surrogate, told The Daily Beast, was “a lot more disciplined than people give it credit for.”“While everyone is talking about the [Michael Cohen] retainer, [Rudy] was also sending a signal to the Mueller team, as far as I could see,” Kingston said. “There was stuff in there beyond the Michael Cohen-Stormy Daniels discussion that everybody is focusing on. And I think an experienced guy like Rudy who… knows how to get the public’s attention, underneath the sizzle, I think there was some really serious stuff that was out there. For example... he said [fired FBI Director James] Comey was a liar, and surely you’re not gonna use him as a credible witness.”As Trump’s representatives made the case that what was really happening was a game of four-dimensional chess, the president was busying himself with an event of a decidedly different tone. Between Giuliani’s last Fox interview and Sanders’ daily press briefing, Trump gathered with faith leaders in the Rose Garden to recognize this year’s National Day of Prayer.—with additional reporting by Betsy Woodruff"},
 {'title': 'BREAKING From Trump’s ‘Doctors’: Most Remarkable Physical Specimen of All Time!',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A Memo On The President’s HealthBy Drs. David Dennison, John Barron, and John MillerThis letter is to certify Donald Trump’s continued robust good health, genius-plus level intellect, and physical perfection. As America’s healthiest President (and many people are saying) the healthiest human being in the world, Mr. Trump is a golden Adonis, a specimen of masculinity so perfect that in the annals of medical science we have been unable to find anyone who can rival him.At 7 feet tall, Mr. Trump is our tallest President, and at just 200 lbs, with \xa0body fat of 0%, he is undoubtedly the fittest President, or indeed sovereign or head or state of any kind, in world history. While Mr. Trump is 70 years old, we assess his physical condition to be that of a 25-year-old elite athlete. His dedication to triathlons, daily weight training, and heavy cardio leaves his cadre of former Navy SEAL physical trainers shaking and exhausted, awed by his sheer endurance and power. As one told us during the preparation of this report, “Mr. Trump could easily complete BUDS/S tomorrow, then do the SFAS course simultaneously with the USAF Pararescue program, and then pass SERE with flying colors.”Mr. Trump has definitely, positively never, ever, ever had gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, the French, Spanish, or English pox, crabs, genital lice, crotch-crickets, Bulgarian junk-rot, the Weeping Cobra, the Gift that Keeps On Giving, Studio 54 Stall Surprise, or Bangkok Fire-Dick. Mr. Trump’s noted fidelity to his wives should put to rest all of these scurrilous rumors. In fact, our laboratory research shows that contact with Mr. Trump’s magnificent body kills all forms of STDs, and also cures scrofula, vertigo, blindness, sleep apnea, and the Jimmy Leg.Mr. Trump’s daily routine is a model of health, not only for a President but for any American. \xa0Each day, Mr. Trump makes America great for eight hours, performs 10 hours of cardio, including strenuous golf-cart riding, hand cardio (Tweeting), and reporter haranguing. He then makes vigorous love to Mrs. Trump for five hours, sleeps one hour and repeats the process. Mr. Trump’s mental acuity transcends even the most aggressive projections for the far future of Singularity-level Artificial Intelligences. His ability to consume volumes of complex intelligence materials in minutes leaves his staff in constant awe. Mr. Trump often demands his briefers present the original intel source material to him untranslated, since his ability to speak 124 languages is unrivaled.When testing Mr. Trump’s mental fitness, we discovered he had not only memorized the Code of Federal Regulations but could extemporaneously recite it in the form of a medieval French chanson de geste. Mr. Trump’s astounding power to understand and rectify complex, multivariate regulatory problems would be a bright display of his status as the most intelligent President ever. Even knowing he was one of the most brilliant men in recorded history, his work on advanced string theory, quantum chromodynamics, and fusion containment is beyond our understanding as mere medical men. Far from deserving just the Nobel Peace Prize, it is our humble opinion that Mr. Trump deserves Nobel Prizes in Literature, Economics, Chemistry, Physics, Medicine, and Making America Great Again.His eyesight is so keen he can spot the panty line on an adult film actress from a half-mile. Mr. Trump’s night vision is so acute he can read the text of a non-disclosure agreement \xa0printed in 4-point type in near-total darkness. The National Reconnaissance Office has asked the President to allow them to make a model of his eyes to develop the next generation of surveillance satellite optics.Mr. Trump’s hearing is so acute that he can discern the faintest dog whistles and can detect any aspersions, insults, or questions regarding his character from miles away. In moments where Mr. Trump is seemingly unable to hear questions, his son-in-law Jared is happy to whisper in his ear, especially regarding his White House rivals.Mr. Trump’s genes display qualities heretofore unknown to science. They are, to use a term of scientific art, bigly superior. Careful analysis reveals that Mr. Trump’s genetic sequences contain not only DNA and RNA, but also TNA, or Trump Nucleic Acids. TNA binds to gold leaf, golf greens, trophy wives, and self-regard. Although it is out of the purview of this report, we believe the only solution to the plague of Antifa Super-Soldiers threatening America is a clone army based on Mr. Trump’s gloriously perfect and unique genetic makeup.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.His hands are so very large that other President’s hands are like those of tiny, tiny dolls by comparison. Believe us. We measured them with extraordinary scientific rigor. Our super-doctory scientific tests reveal that Mr. Trump’s hands are also very, very strong. The President can crush a titanium ingot like a marshmallow. He can palm bowling balls, and throw them over a mile without breaking a sweat. He has often carried weights heavier than any other President, ever.Mr. Trump’s hair is thick, fast-growing, and retains its natural golden hue from his youth. His skin is that of a teenage farmgirl; smooth, taut, perfectly free of any wrinkles, moles, blemishes, wens, cystic formations, or signs of a lifetime of fast-food addiction, rough living, whoring, or long nights spent in the humid darkness of a low-rent Atlantic City casino.Even for a man of Mr. Trump’s astounding health, constitution, physical perfection, and genetic gifts, life is not without challenges.Mr. Trump’s body emits a thick musk of pure testosterone, causing men near him to become aggressive, and women to strip off their clothes and beg him to grab them by their reproductive organs. This powerful scent is a constant challenge to the Secret Service, as battalions of scantily-clad women wearing little but MAGA hats and thong panties throw themselves at the President, forming human pyramids to scale security fences and showing up in attorney Michael Cohen’s office demanding $130,000 payments.Mr. Trump’s manhood is, as you will be unsurprised to learn, is the largest of any President, and in fact, larger than any mammalian penis outside that of the majestic blue whale. His genitals require a system of complex straps, buckles, pulleys, trusses, and velcro attachment points to contain them within his custom-fitted trousers. As his very real physicians (who many people say are the best medical experts from the best schools ever, and totally not the pen names of an insecure man consumed by his petty vanities and insecurities) we certify the preceding to be really, really true.Dr. David DennisonDr. John BarronDr. John Miller"},
 {'title': 'Donald Trump Jr. Called Blocked Number Before and After Trump Tower Meeting With Russians',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Donald Trump Jr. made several mysterious phone calls to blocked numbers before and after the Trump Tower meeting with Russians promising “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.The phone calls were revealed in a report released by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday (PDF)—part of a whirlwind day of revelations about the investigations into Trumpland. We learned, among other things, that the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign was deeper than previously known, and that there are millions of dollars more in suspicious financial dealings by Trump fixer Michael Cohen.But the newly revealed actions of Trump Jr. may prove the most significant discovery, even if at the moment those actions raise more questions than answers. On the day he arranged the meeting the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, Trump Jr. placed two calls to blocked numbers. After the meeting ended without the promised dirt, Trump Jr. placed another call to a blocked number. When asked if his father used a blocked number on any phone, Trump Jr. told the committee: “I don’t know.” Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, on the other hand, testified that Trump’s “primary residence has a blocked [phone] line.”Asked directly if he had told his father about the meeting, Trump Jr. said, “I never discussed it with him at all.”The phone calls began on June 6, 2016. That morning, Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, music producer for Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov. Goldstone wrote that the Kremlin “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary” and Trump Jr. should talk to Emin to arrange a meeting to obtain it. Minutes after speaking to Emin, Trump Jr. placed a four-minute call to a blocked number. Minutes later, Trump called Emin again, scheduled the meeting for June 9, and then placed another call to a blocked number that lasted 11 minutes.Two days later, candidate Trump announced he would give a “major speech” the following week where “we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.”The following day, June 9, Trump Jr. met Kremlin-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower where she alleged Democratic donors stole money from Russia. “So can you show us how does this money go to Hillary?” Trump Jr. asked Veselnitskaya, one attendee told the Senate Judiciary Committee. It apparently wasn’t what the Trump team expected. Goldstone testified that an “agitated” Jared Kushner, who was also invited to the meeting, was “infuriate[d]” that Veselnitskaya didn’t have dirt on Clinton.

At least one government informant met with Trump campaign advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. FBI agents even considered interviewing Page, Papadopoulos, campaign manager Paul Manafort, and national security adviser Michael Flynn as the election was ongoing. Far from trying to undermine Trump’s chances, the FBI chose not to interview the Trump team for fear of the investigation leaking. Contrary to Republican claims that Christopher Steele’s dossier kicked off the investigation, the Times reported his memos languished at the FBI for months before making it to the Trump investigators.Goldstone regretted Trump Tower meetingAlmost a year before Wednesday’s dizzying revelations, the Trump Tower meeting became public and newly released emails show participants scrambling to react.Goldstone seemed aware that the meeting had the potential to cause headaches as reporters came closer.After the meeting, Goldstone also bemoaned its fallout. On June 27, 2017—about two weeks before The New York Times broke the news of the meeting—Goldstone emailed Emin to complain. “That meeting I set up in October with Trump campaign for your father for that Russian attorney and her colleagues is causing massive problems,” Goldstone wrote Emin on June 27, 2017. “I have today been interviewed by attorneys for the second time about it. They are concerned because it links Don Jr. to officials from Russia–which he has always denied meeting. I did say at the time this was an awful idea and a terrible meeting... It’s a really potentially serious situation–so you and your father should be aware.”“Understood Rob,” Emin replied. After the meeting exploded into the public eye, Goldstone wrote to Emin: “I hope this favor was worth it for your dad–it could blow up big.”Oligarch repeatedly offered Trump support The Senate Judiciary documents also show that Goldstone’s patrons, the Agalarov family, reached out to the Trump campaign earlier than previously known. Right before Super Tuesday in February 2016—when most primaries were held—Goldstone emailed Trump Jr. and his father’s personal assistant, Rhona Graff, to pass along a message of support from Agalarov.“Emin’s father has asked me to pass on his congratulations in a letter enclosed below for Mr. Trump on the eve of super Tuesday vote—offering his support and that of many of his important Russian friends and colleagues—especially with reference to U.S./Russian relations,” Goldstone wrote. “Best of luck to you all and many thanks for passing on this letter.”Months earlier, Emin invited Trump to his father’s 60th birthday party in Moscow. After Graff told Goldstone that Trump wouldn’t be able to attend because of the campaign schedule, Goldstone had an intriguing reply:“I totally understand re Moscow—unless maybe he would welcome a meeting with President Putin which Emin would set up,” he wrote.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Democratic outside groups have largely held their fire ahead of Tuesday’s special election in the deep-red 8th congressional in Arizona. But as many have chosen to avoid the fray, one man has decided to step into it, with hopes that pulling off an electoral miracle could refocus the national conversation on health care policy. Ady Barkan is quickly becoming one of the more publicly-known health care advocates in the country. Diagnosed with ALS over a year ago, he became a fixture in the halls of Congress, pleading with lawmakers to not axe Obamacare. He no longer is on the Hill. But he is still involved politically. His organization is investing in congressional races and Barkan himself is directly engaging candidates and lawmakers on the need to protect health care rights.A video of him confronting Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) about the repeal of the individual mandate in the GOP tax bill became a viral sensation last December. And last week, Barkan directly challenged a lawmaker once again, this time approaching Republican state senator Debbie Lesko, who is running to replace former Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) in the special. In a brief video posted to his Twitter account, Barkan asked Lesko about an article from The Washington Post in which House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said last year that Republicans were going to be looking at curtailing entitlement spending. Lesko challenged the premise of the article, though promised that she would read it in full when it was offered to her. That wasn’t enough to change Barkan’s support for the Democrat in the race, Hiral Tipirneni. Though, to be fair, he wasn’t exactly approaching Lesko with the possibility that his endorsement could be won. Barkan is not just a viral video creator. He’s an electoral activist. And he has built a team around him, which recently made a $100,000 investment in to the Arizona race.It’s an odd choice, because few think that Lesko will lose. President Trump won the district by 21 points in the 2016 presidential election and national Republicans have spent about $1 million collectively on the contest. Meanwhile, Democrats have been mostly content with allowing the Arizona Democratic Party to assist Tipirneni’s campaign directly. The Democratic National Committee, according to a source familiar, awarded a $75,000 grant to the state party as part of a total investment of over $175,000 through online fundraising, digital ads, texting and staff on the ground and through infrastructure investments into the party to support its efforts to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has not spent money on television on her behalf. But where others see a lost cause, Barkan sees an opportunity.“She’s a doctor and she’s running on a really robust progressive vision of Medicare buy in for all,” Barkan said in an interview, explaining his support. “I’m excited about her and believe it’s a crucial referendum on politics of healthcare in America which many people believe is the top issue for voters.”Last week, Barkan and a host of progressive activists announced the launch of the Be a Hero initiative, created in part by the Center for Popular Democracy Action, a group that has consistently protested efforts at health care repeal and the GOP tax plan. Along with their launch, organizers put out a heart-tugging video of Barkan talking about his struggle with ALS over the past year and addressing his young son Carl. The stated purpose of the group is to galvanize support for progressive candidates in the midterm elections. But those close to Barkan saw an opportunity to first test his message in Arizona before November comes. On Thursday, the progressive group Working Families Party announced that they’d be teaming up with Barkan to front the $100,000 for the ad campaign, which featured some of the previously mentioned Barkan footage and an appeal from Barkan to vote for Tipirneni. The spot will run through election day.

His Be a Hero campaign will continue raising money and attempting to get low propensity Democrats to the polls in the midterm elections. All the while, Barkan is realistic about his future and his personal struggle with ALS.“I’m trying to make lemonade,” said Barkan, who noted that his political advocacy began when he worked on Rep. Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) campaign when he was a sophomore in high school. “I’d obviously much rather be doing the advocacy I was doing in 2015 and ‘16 before I got sick but [you] don’t always get to choose the battles that you fight and you got to fight as best you can with the cards that you’ve been dealt.”— This article has been updated to reflect new totals in money spent on the race by the DNC."},
 {'title': 'Bill de Blasio, Bernie Sanders, and the Left-Wing’s Own ‘Fake News’ Problem',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "With its front page composite photo of Bill de Blasio sporting Donald Trump’s coiffure, the New York Post reported with no small amount of glee that the progressive New York mayor sounded “positively Trumpian” in private emails blasting the local news media.De Blasio has responded by going on the offensive against “corporate media”—and really, he doesn’t sound so much like Trump as Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator also assailed the news media as part of his 2016 presidential campaign. He was more subtle and fact-based than Trump, but the bottom line was that he, too, argued that large segments of the news media can’t be believed. The left, as well as the right, has helped to de-legitimize the news media.There is a grain of truth in complaints from both sides. Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post is Exhibit A for how a new corporate owner can impose his political slant on a news organization from Day 1. And conservatives are right that most people working in the news business, especially on a national level, are liberals and tend to know only other liberals.But in both cases, this has morphed into expansive conspiracy theories that malign the credible news reporting that democracy requires—which, by and large, is what mainstream news organizations produce. The right had led the way here, as seen in the historically large partisan divide in public confidence\xa0in media coverage, but is not the only offender.Sanders summarized the left-wing case in “Corporate Media and the Threat to Our Democracy,” a chapter in his 2016 book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. His evidence for the media’s failure is that he couldn’t get coverage for various news conferences that dealt with substantive issues. But the issues he cited were in fact getting coverage in major newspapers, even if his press conferences weren’t getting the attention he wanted.A case in point was a media event he held in New York City to talk about dilapidated conditions in public housing. “There was almost no coverage of this issue,” he complained. But actually, the New York Daily News had exposed this problem in one article after another. The ongoing neglect of the housing projects was already well known to the public precisely because of the “corporate media.”Similarly, Sanders bemoaned the lack of coverage for a 2013 news conference he held with AARP and other advocacy organizations about proposed cuts in Social Security. “It was not of interest to the corporately owned media,” he wrote. But that didn’t mean there was no media interest in the fate of Social Security. There had been stories in the “corporate media” in previous months about how liberal legislators and groups such as AARP were trying to head off changes in Social Security. At the time, President Barack Obama was willing to revise the program to get a deal with Republicans on extending the federal debt limit. Sanders was quoted in a Washington Post story. He had a letter to the editor in The New York Times, agreeing with an editorial it had carried on the subject.And yet, in his book, he insisted that “corporate media” were not interested in the public’s retirement payments. There are echoes of Sanders in de Blasio’s critique. “I think it’s the corporate media that in too many ways is not telling the larger truth of our society, not just the interest of a corporate ownership structure,” the mayor told reporters Friday in a rare mayoral visit to the press room in City Hall, Room 9, on the other side of the rotunda from the mayor’s office, where he blasted the work of the reporters there. “The truth is not being told, or it’s being wildly biased.”The occasion for this visit was the city’s release of more than 4,000 pages of internal emails between the mayor’s office and a public relations consulting firm, BerlinRosen, as a result of a unanimous May 1 records-access ruling by a five-member appellate court. One thing to be said for corporate ownership is that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit—Spectrum News NY1 and the New York Post—had the resources to spend three years fighting de Blasio in court to win release of these public records. As a former City Hall reporter—I covered Mayor Edward I. Koch throughout a 1980s corruption scandal, and later, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani—I found familiar scenarios in the emails. De Blasio and his aides agonized over the coverage, as previous administrations \xa0had,  and contrived to spin it their way. The reporters mostly asked for comment on stories they were working on.

It’s an old New York story, for sure, but it created an appearance that troubled the judge who initially ordered the emails released. “Rosen is a private citizen whose private interests may diverge from those of the City in connection with his representation of his private clients, some of whom conduct business which may be impacted by city policies, such as zoning matters,” State Supreme Court Justice Joan Lobis wrote.That may be the heart of the matter, but I can understand if reporters focused instead on an email in which de Blasio commented \xa0coldly on the possibility of a shutdown at the Daily News. “And that would be good for us, right? Or would that make the Post more dominant?” he wrote. “Or, conversely, would it hasten the demise of the Post—prob just wishful thinking.”\xa0What was more revealing to me is the argument de Blasio became embroiled in with Bloomberg News City Hall reporter Henry Goldman when he visited the press room on Friday.Goldman complained that de Blasio had derided an accurate 2014 article he wrote saying that an unexpected $4 billion budget surplus would help municipal workers in coming labor talks with the mayor. “You said, `Oh you can’t believe that. Look who published it: Bloomberg News,’” he said.“Are we living in a dream world where we think the owners of the media don’t exert influence, is that what you’re saying to me?” de Blasio answered.That’s the broad-brush “corporate media” critique—and in a case when it doesn’t seem to make sense, since the existence of a big surplus is a boon for labor. Besides, Bloomberg News happens to have numerous awards for exposing corporate conniving, including a 2015 Pulitzer Prize for explaining how companies avoid taxes by changing addresses.A more telling critique of corporate media in New York than the self-interested one de Blasio has offered might have been to note that Mayor Michael Bloomberg secured the approval of the the owners of the News, Post, and Times before setting out to change a term-limits law that voters had twice approved so that he could run for a third term. (When one reporter later asked Bloomberg—who’d claimed his leadership was indispensable after the 2008 market crash only to tout his accomplishments as he ran for that third term—why he was still needed if things were going so well, the mayor hissed: “You’re a disgrace.”)There is a critique to be made of the corporate media, of New York’s “tabloid culture,” as de Blasio puts it, and also of biased or short-sighted reporting. But it won’t be made properly through wild charges that serve to de-legitimize honest reporting. "},
 {'title': 'Senate Intel Reaches Bipartisan Consensus on Russian Hacking—Unlike House Counterpart',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday revealed their recommendations for improving the country’s election infrastructure and guarding it against foreign cyberattacks—a critical component of that panel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.In a veiled swipe at President Donald Trump, the bipartisan report includes a direct plea to federal officials to “clearly communicate to adversaries that an attack on our election infrastructure is a hostile act, and we will respond accordingly.”Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have taken issue with Trump’s dismissive statements about Russian election-meddling and his apparent unwillingness to treat the issue with urgency, in addition to his administration’s hesitance to immediately and fully implement congressionally mandated sanctions against Russia in response to its election-meddling.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the chairman of the committee, said federal officials need to be “more effective at deterring our adversaries” like Russia, which “was looking for vulnerabilities” in U.S. election systems ahead of the 2016 election as part of its coordinated campaign to interfere in and influence the outcome of the election.“If you’ve got intent and capability, then you’ve got a threat,” Burr said alongside his colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats. “Russia is not the only one with the capability, and they’re probably not the only one that has the intent.”After briefing reporters on the committee’s report, Burr said he was “less concerned with what the president says and I’m more concerned with what [the Department of Homeland Security] and other agencies do.”On Tuesday, committee members were united in their condemnation of Russia over its interference in the 2016 election, and in their dire warnings over the likelihood for future election-meddling from hostile foreign actors like Russia. Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) warned that the Russians have “set a path that others can follow” in the future.It was a notable difference in tone from the House’s intelligence panel, which has been locked in partisan squabbling for months over its Russia investigation. The House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation wrapped up last week, with Republicans and Democrats set to issue their own partisan final reports rather than a non-partisan one on the findings of the investigation.While the report does not address past vulnerabilities, it outlines steps that individual states and localities can take in order to “better defend against a hostile nation-state who may seek to undermine our democracy.” The recommendations represented the committee’s first public report as part of its Russia investigation, which was launched last year.“The Russians continue to undertake sophisticated attacks to exacerbate the divisions in our country,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said. “We may never know the full extent of the Russian malicious attacks.”The full report comes as states and municipalities nationwide have already begun holding primaries for the 2018 cycle. U.S. intelligence chiefs have warned that Russia will interfere in the midterm elections—and feels emboldened to do so. At least one top official, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, has attributed Russia’s intentions to the Trump administration not doing “enough” to counter the Kremlin’s anti-democratic efforts.“More broadly, my concern is, I believe that [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin has clearly come to the conclusion there’s little price to pay here, and that therefore I can continue this activity,” Rogers said last month in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Burr reiterated on Tuesday that the federal government as a whole needs to do more.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.While there isn’t any evidence that election results were altered in 2016, federal officials believe that Russians targeted election infrastructure in nearly two dozen states and successfully hacked into one voter database. The recommendations issued by the committee on Tuesday did not address Russia’s coordinated influence-campaign that sought to impersonate Americans on social media to exacerbate political tensions in the U.S.Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the vice chairman of the Senate panel, said it took the Department of Homeland Security nine months to inform state officials that their systems were targeted by a foreign actor. Additionally, Warner said, 14 states were using equipment in the 2016 election that provided no verifiable paper trail. Senators said states should remain in charge of their own election infrastructure, with the federal government serving in an advise-and-assist role and participating in intelligence-sharing.“The Intelligence Community should put a high priority on attributing cyber attacks both quickly and accurately,” the report states. “Similarly, policymakers should make plans to operate prior to attribution.”The senators also recommended that Congress “urgently pass legislation” to establish a “voluntary grant program” for individual states. Those funds would be intended to “improve cybersecurity by hiring additional Information Technology staff, updating software, and contracting vendors to provide cybersecurity services, among other steps.”On Wednesday, the committee will hold a public hearing on election security, with witnesses including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Jeh Johnson, who held that position during the Obama administration."},
 {'title': 'Senate Intelligence Committee Now Wants to Grill Roger Stone',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Senate intelligence committee has asked to interview Roger Stone, Donald Trump’s longtime political adviser and self-described dirty trickster. Stone’s lawyer, Grant Smith, told The Daily Beast that the committee last week sent them an email with a list of search terms for communications to use to determine which electronic communications to turn over to the Senate Intelligence Committee. At the same time, according to Smith, the committee said its members would like to question Stone after receiving the documents. Smith said the process has been amicable and that the interview date has not yet been set.Stone told The Daily Beast he hopes the interview with the committee will be public, and said he has “already begun to think about what to wear.” Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Stone, in emails written to an associate of WikiLeaks founder-slash-embassy crasher Julian Assange, had solicited “damaging” information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the late stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. That appears to be inconsistent with his September testimony before the House intelligence committee, when he said he “merely wanted confirmation” of Assange having dirt on Trump’s political opponent.Stone has become a central focus for investigators looking into potential coordination between President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin. On May 20 on NBC’s Meet the Press, he said he is ready for Special Counsel Bob Mueller to indict him. “I am prepared, should that be the case,” he said. “But I think it just demonstrates, again, this was supposed to be about Russian collusion, and it appears to be an effort to silence or punish the president’s supporters and his advocates.” Stone raised eyebrows when he appeared to predict the release of emails hacked from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. Stone also reportedly told the House intelligence committee that radio host Randy Credico was his backchannel to Assange. Credico told The Daily Beast that wasn’t true. In March, Stone told CNN that the Senate committee asked him to preserve any documents that could be related to its probe. And former Trump aide Sam Nunberg told CNN in May that the committee asked him to turn over communications with Stone about Wikileaks and other topics. '},
 {'title': 'Trey Gowdy: FBI’s Use of Informant for Trump Campaign Was Appropriate',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on Tuesday that the FBI’s use of an informant for the Trump campaign in 2016 was appropriate, joining top Democrats in disputing President Donald Trump’s characterization of the informant as a spy.“I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump,” Gowdy said during an interview on Fox News.In recent days, Trump has parroted misleading claims about the FBI’s use of the informant as part of its counter-intelligence investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, dubbing the individual a “spy” and referring to the controversy as “Spygate.” Gowdy’s comments were significant because the former federal prosecutor participated in a classified briefing about the informant last week that was conducted by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The so-called “Gang of Eight”—which includes House and Senate leaders in addition to the top Republicans and Democrats on the intelligence committees—also joined the briefing. The Democrats present at the meeting previously released a joint statement saying they heard “no evidence” from Rosenstein and Wray that a “spy” was placed within the Trump campaign.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also backed Gowdy’s and other congressional leaders’ characterization of the FBI’s activities as part of the counter-intelligence investigation. On Sunday, the senator said the FBI was right to look into “individuals with a history of links to Russia that were concerning.”One of the president’s top lawyers, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, said on Sunday that the use of the informant means special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation is no longer “legitimate.” Giuliani said the government was “spying on a candidate of the opposition party,” comparing it to Watergate.Giuliani also raised serious doubts about whether the president would ever sit for an interview with the special counsel. But Gowdy said Trump needs to do an interview so that the president could testify privately to Mueller's team about what he has said publicly—that there was no collusion with Russia, and that he did not obstruct justice.“If he were my client, and I’d say if you’ve done nothing wrong, you need to sit down and tell Mueller what you know,” he said.Separately, Gowdy said Trump’s detractors including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, are “doing a disservice to our fellow citizens” when they do not “make it clear” that the president is not a “target” of the investigation."},
 {'title': 'FBI Raid on Michael Cohen Is the Most Dangerous Day of Donald Trump’s Life',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Monday’s FBI raids on Michael Cohen’s Rockefeller Center office, his hotel room, and his home all provided a proper dose of comeuppance to a man more accustomed to screaming threats, shit-tier legal theorizing, and putting his strip-mall law degree to work in service of Donald Trump. Cohen, far from being the superlawyer to a billionaire real-estate tycoon, really only has one important job: covering up Trump’s alleged dalliances. It was Cohen batting cleanup, dealing with an army of models, escorts, Mistresses (large “M” and small “m”), actresses, porn stars, models, Real Dolls, fangirls, groupies, and random topiary at Mar-a-Delicto with a wall of nondisclosure agreements. Master of the NDA, Cohen thought attorney-client privilege would protect him.He forgot he had a fool for a client. Trump couldn’t shut his mouth on Air Force One last week.Even before Trump opened his mouth on that fateful day, Cohen had managed to repeatedly hoist himself with his own petard in his dumb legal fight with adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, hoping she would, like so many of Trump’s endless bimbo eruptions, go away after one of his spittle-flecked, apoplectic tantrums. If you ever wanted to see a proof of the Steve Jobs “As hire Bs and Bs hire Cs” rule, it was Trump hiring Cohen, and then Cohen hiring an attorney who was an even lower-rent knockoff version of himself. Hilarity ensued.The image of Michael Cohen as a superlawyer was always laughable, and even the Trump fan club recognized that Cohen was a particular flavor of attorney: The Fixer. His desire to cast himself as a real-life Ray Donovan made him a kind of overwrought, grunting thug character destined for the cutting-room floor in even the most lurid soap-opera script. Cohen, though, should be understood as an almost perfect metaphor for the Trump era, the Trump White House, and everything else orbiting this president like the hot chunks of waste spinning around the central oscillator at a sewage-treatment plant. He truly brings it all: the shoddy, hair-trigger temperament, the indifferent education and understanding of the world outside of dalliance-cleanup duty and real-estate branding deals, the malfeasance, the petty corruption, general shitheel behavior, the impulsivity, the tantrum-as-negotiation style, and the overall sketchiness of the Trump administration. Like Trump, his enablers, and supporters, Cohen thought his position as a Trump inner-circle member would protect him indefinitely. He believed, after so many years of getting away with every kind of shenanigan at Trump’s behest, that the facts would never matter, the music would never stop, and the party would never end. Again, he’s a perfect metaphor for this administration. Then the FBI came knocking. Imagine that moment, when he realized that they were going to raid his office, home, and hotel room. It was one thing for Cohen to pay Stormy’s $135,000 hush-money payment from his home-equity loan. “Happens all the time!” “Common practice!” “Trump never even met her, I’m just really generous!” (For you Trump readers, that’s called sarcasm.)It’s quite another when the most experienced and determined federal prosecutors are giving you an investigative colonoscopy. If you think for one moment there’s nothing dodgy and damaging against Trump in the files of Cohen, think again. Suddenly, Michael Cohen, the bag-walking, dick-swinging swagger-monkey wannabe thug attorney and consigliere for Donald Trump’s far-flung penile enterprises is scared. If Cohen had a lump of coal in his ass the moment those search warrants arrived, he could have popped out a diamond. He realizes how deep this hole can become if he doesn’t roll over. He doesn’t have the resources to defend himself, and Trump isn’t exactly known for paying his bills in the first place. Cohen is scared, and he’s not alone. What has to strike absolute terror into Trump at this moment is the fact that the Southern District of New York, acting on a referral from Robert Mueller, was able to obtain extraordinarily broad authority and was granted search warrants that may even penetrate attorney-client privilege. Trump must know this may be one of the most dangerous moments in his entire life, not just his presidency. The likelihood is that Mueller and the FBI are now in possession of the Black Books of Trump, NDAs from enough of Trump’s various affairs that you can staff a 12-pole strip club with plenty of girls left for the Champagne rooms. It’s only speculation at this point, but it’s quite likely that Cohen was the keeper of many of Trump’s lending documents, contracts, business arrangements, and the Kryptonite of Trump’s fragile self-worth: the long-sought tax returns.

As one of my hedge-fund friends (an actual billionaire) said of Trump in 2015, “He’s a clown living on credit.” For Trump to have the public learn that he may not be as wealthy as he has continued to claim as the central element of his branding would hurt him more than if Mueller then proved he took sacks of cash and a foot massage from Vladimir Putin. Collusion with the Russians is nothing compared to having his baroque finances revealed. Trump would rather be known as a traitor than as someone who isn’t one of the Masters of the Universe.This is, of course, another one of those moments where Trump may listen to the devil perched on his shoulder and simply burn the entire Department of Justice to the ground. He is obviously unable to retain counsel skilled enough to control his constant verbal dysentery, even when his yammering puts him in enormous legal peril.Cohen was one of Trump’s most vulnerable and dangerous keepers of secrets. If Trump had a brain, he would have been terrified this moment would come. Cohen simply lived in a state of idiot hubris that it wouldn’t. "},
 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt’s D.C. Lobbyist Landlord Also Funded His Oklahoma Attorney General Campaign',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Before Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt rented a room from a top DC energy lobbyist, that lobbyist and his wife funded Pruitt’s efforts to climb the political ladder in his home state of Oklahoma.Campaign finance records in the state show that Steven and Vicki Hart, the power couple who last year rented Pruitt a room in their Capitol Hill home for $50 per night, began donating to Pruitt’s campaigns for Oklahoma attorney general in 2010. Steven Hart even hosted a fundraiser for Pruitt’s reelection effort.The cascading controversy over Pruitt’s living arrangements has roiled his standing in the administration. The New York Times reported on Monday that a client of Hart’s firm, Williams & Jensen, received EPA approval for an oil pipeline project while Pruitt rented a room in Hart’s home. Also on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House was investigating Pruitt’s conduct. And on Tuesday, The Washington Post revealed that a top Pruitt aide who oversaw a pair of allied political groups had been tasked with finding living arrangements for the administrator in Washington.But one detail has remained murky: how, and when, the relationship between Pruitt and the Harts began. A Daily Beast review of public records reveals that that relationship goes back years, and has resulted in significant financial upside for Pruitt’s political operation.The Harts’ first apparent contribution to Pruitt was a $500 donation in October of 2010, about two weeks before Pruitt was first elected attorney general. They donated $1,000 the following year, and $250 the year after. When Pruitt ran for reelection in 2014, Steven Hart footed the bill for a fundraising reception benefitting his campaign. After he was reelected, Pruitt set up a federal political committee that made contributions to allied Republicans. Hart donated to that group in 2015.A spokesman for the EPA declined to comment on the donations.Hart wasn’t the only Williams & Jensen executive to give to Pruitt. George Baker and Jack McMackin, both principals at the firm, donated to Pruitt’s federal group, Oklahoma Strong Leadership PAC, on the same day as Hart. Baker had also contributed to Pruitt’s AG campaign in 2011 and 2012.All of those donations help illustrate how Pruitt ended up in the Harts’ DC rowhouse. As The Daily Beast reported on Monday, the house was a frequent venue for Republican fundraising events. A member of Congress told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that it is affectionately known on the Hill as “the Williams & Jensen condo.” And the firm has fairly extensive ties to Oklahoma. Hart himself is a Sooner. The firm’s late co-founder, J.D. Williams, also hailed from the state. Mike Hunter, the current Oklahoma Attorney General and a former top Pruitt aide, previously served as a Williams & Jensen attorney in the firm’s Washington D.C. office.Some of William & Jensen’s clients reflect that history: since 2000, for instance, the firm has represented OGE Energy Corp., the Oklahoma City-based company whose subsidiaries include Oklahoma Gas & Electric, the state’s largest utility. Among the government entities the firm has lobbied on OGE’s behalf is Pruitt’s EPA.The firm’s ties to the state have turned “the Williams & Jensen condo” into a go-to fundraising destination for members of the Oklahoma delegation in particular, a former Hill staffer told The Daily Beast. And while Hart’s connections to Pruitt may be rooted in that Oklahoma bind, they also were forged during the early days of the Trump administration. Hart helped run the Trump transition team’s labor department portfolio at the same time Pruitt was being tapped to take over the EPA.The revelation of the ties between the two men have now created problems for both. Hart has largely ducked media requests since confirming Pruitt had rented his town house on the Hill. And he did not return a request for comment for this article. Pruitt, meanwhile, has seen calls for his resignation escalate in recent days, with a House Republican—Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL)—joining the chorus on Tuesday.

But on Tuesday afternoon, Trump seemed almost non-committal when discussing Pruitt’s future. “I hope he’s going to be great,” Trump said when asked about Pruitt during a meeting with leaders of the Baltic states."},
 {'title': 'Being Terrible to Teens Is an American Political Tradition',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'In the weeks since the Parkland, Florida school shooting, negative scrutiny of outspoken, young survivors has been steadily building. Emma Gonzalez, one prominent survivor and activist, has been dubbed a “skinhead lesbian,” and this week, David Hogg, another survivor, was accused of whining over his college admissions records.A lot of people are outraged at what they view as an extraordinary smearing of kids who entered the political arena willingly, but also because the spotlight was brought to them after a crazed gunman killed 17 of their fellow classmates and teachers.. The reality, however, is that the Parkland kids being subjected to this kind of thing is nothing particularly new or novel, even if you think it’s gross. In fact, in America, we pretty regularly attack kids who are much more peripherally involved in politics and policy debates than Gonzales and Hogg have been.Let’s jump back in time for a minute, to about nine-and-a-half years ago, when Sarah Palin entered the consciousness of 300 million Americans as Sen. John McCain’s Vice Presidential nominee. Palin immediately became the focus of a ton of poking and prodding into her political and personal life. But so too did her kids, who had made no decision to enter politics at all. Remember the proliferation, immediately after McCain announced his running mate, of Trig Palin birtherism at prominent political blogs that had real standing and clout within the Democratic Party and mainstream media? I do, not least because I was one of the Republican campaign staffers tasked with attempting to quash it. Watching a baby forced into the media spotlight and become the focus of some fairly vicious rumor-mongering because people didn’t like his politician mom was not a highlight of 2008 for me, much as I imagine dealing with smears focused on Bridget McCain back in 2000 were no fun for McCain staffers at that time. Similarly, watching stories later pop about Willow Palin—who, like her little brother, also made no decision to become a political celebrity—was no treat.A closer, and fairer, comparison to Hogg and Gonzalez might be Jonathan Krohn. In case you don’t remember, he’s the kid who spoke at CPAC in 2009— a then-13 year-old conservative Bill Bennett fan. Negative scrutiny of Krohn seems lightweight compared to that of Hogg. But there are still similarities. Suggestions that Krohn had been “brainwashed” by his parents drew into hints that he might be an unwitting vehicle for some Machiavellian, adult, nefarious political interest, similar to how some people have suggested that Hogg \xa0is being “used” as a messaging vehicle by George Soros. As it happens, it now seems that Hogg has long had it in him to become a political activist. He told Axios before last weekend’s march that his plan had always been “to go to college so I could do stuff like this and help change the future of America politically.”A question some people are asking is whether we need a higher de facto “age of consent” before we can treat young people participating in political and policy debates as fair targets. Clearly, on both the left and the right, there’s a lot of discomfort when people as young as the Parkland students, or Krohn or the Palin kids or Bridget McCain, are attacked, and clearly, there’s a sense that the similar though less stringent \xa0rules need not apply to older kids actively involving themselves in politics, like, say, Meghan McCain or Chelsea Clinton in and after 2008.Maybe that discomfort comes because attacking young people who are trying to improve their country, even if we think they’re wrong about how to go about it, runs counter to Americans’ basic democratic, optimistic, look-to-the-future instincts—that political participation by the younger generation is good and should be encouraged, because they’re beginning to take ownership of the country they will one day run.Maybe it’s because some 45-year-olds have a hard time seeing an 18-year-old as anything other than an overgrown baby, still in need of protection by adults from the nasty, brutish real world.Maybe it’s just a symptom of (some) people’s broader discomfort with what they see as an overall coarsening of political debate and people abandoning basic rules and norms in favor of clickbait and higher viewership. Of course, critics of Hogg and Gonzalez will accuse them of the same thing, but that doesn’t necessarily negate the argument that people behaving worse and worse to each other is a problem. In fact, it might signal that the problem is wider and deeper than we thought—yes, even in the era of President Trump and his Twitter and Kathy Griffin and her bad “jokes” involving Trump masks.As a 2nd amendment maximalist, it’s hard for me to believe that Hogg and Gonzalez did not realize what would happen when they stepped up to the podium on this, perhaps America’s most divisive policy issue on which the two sides are the most entrenched and unmovable. But maybe we have gotten a little too off-point, at a minimum, and crude and rude, at a maximum. Certainly that appears to be the case when we have TMZ doing features on teenage political activists’ college admission records that are picked up on cable news, or immediate speculation that someone wearing a Cuban flag badge signifies their support for communism as opposed to pride in their heritage. On some level, it appears we can do a little better, without taking a pass on criticism where it is genuinely warranted.'},
 {'title': 'If Team Trump Leaked Mueller’s Questions, It’s Bound to Backfire',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The New York Times recently obtained and published a list of more than 40 questions that special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump. Is this leak a carefully orchestrated move in a chess match, or a desperate attempt to roil the investigation? The questions themselves seem thorough but straightforward—questions relating to widely reported events, such as the firings of former FBI Director James Comey and former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower.The only surprise was a question about outreach by the Trump campaign, including Paul Manafort, to Russia for election assistance. Previous reports had indicated offers of assistance going only in the other direction. This could be a significant new reveal (it’s unlikely Mueller would ask a question based on a false premise) or it could just be a scrivener’s error, in light of the way these questions were obtained by the Times. Mueller’s team reportedly read the questions over the telephone to members of Trump’s legal team, who wrote them down. As anyone who has ever played the old “Telephone” game knows, details are sometimes lost in the translation, and so it may be that this development is nothing new. And so the “what” regarding these questions is mostly unsurprising. The surprise is the “who” and the “why.” First, who might have leaked these questions? Mueller himself or someone on his team could have done so, but Mueller is known for his tight-lipped approach to investigations. Not only is it against his nature to leak these questions, it is also against his interest. Sharing these questions with the media telegraphs areas of inquiry to all other witnesses. The president may get the extraordinary courtesy of advance notice of the questions to induce him to come to the table, but no other witness will likely receive this unusual benefit. Publishing these questions only stands to compromise Mueller’s investigation, and so it seems unlikely that the leak came from his camp.That leaves Trump’s team with Rudy Giuliani, new to the team. These questions were not leaked when they were first communicated to Trump’s team in March, but only now, after Giuliani has come on board. Why might Trump’s legal team want to leak these questions? The answer may lie in Trump’s morning tweets. Trump criticized the leak, and then stated: “No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!” A second tweet said, “It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!”He seems to be making the public case that the investigation is now all about obstruction of justice, and not about coordination with Russia to interfere with the election. Even this premise is false, in light of the fact that several questions relate to contacts with Russians. Nonetheless, more than half of the questions appear to relate to obstruction of justice. Trump seems to be arguing that this focus on obstruction of justice exposes the investigation as an unfounded, politically motivated scandal. If this leak came from Trump’s team, it is reminiscent of the Sam Nunberg media blitz after he received a subpoena to testify before Mueller’s grand jury and to produce email messages with certain individuals. Nunberg seemed to think that he could generate outrage by going public with his story about his perceived overreach by the special counsel. That strategy failed miserably and Nunberg ultimately complied with the subpoena. Of course, the law does not require proof of the underlying crime to make out a case for obstruction of justice because sometimes the obstruction is successful. But Trump likely is less concerned about the court of law than he is about the court of public opinion. Because he likely would face impeachment instead of criminal charges, this may be a shrewd move. Mueller likely wants to talk to Trump as part of his quest for the truth. Mueller no doubt wants to learn what happened in our election and whether Trump had the corrupt intent necessary to obstruct justice. If Trump has leaked these questions, it seems likely that he has decided not to talk to Mueller voluntarily. Mueller can subpoena Trump, but such a step could lead to lengthy court hearings and delay. Will this strategy to generate public outrage garner sympathy for Trump or backfire as it did on Nunberg? Your move, Mr. Mueller. '},

He can no longer find enough work for his crew as self-driving trucks hit the highways. He sees his life savings about to go down the tubes because like many truck drivers, he owes the bank tens of thousands of dollars in loans he took out to buy his vehicles. He says to his guys, “Screw this. We can’t be replaced by robot trucks. Let’s go to Springfield and demand our jobs back.” He leads a protest in Illinois, and hundreds of underemployed truckers join in, some of them bringing their vehicles and blocking major highways. The police respond but they are reluctant to use force. The crowds multiply as more drivers and rioters arrive.Inspired by what they see on social media, unemployed truckers—who now number in the thousands—begin to protest in other state capitals. The National Guard is activated and the president calls for calm, but disorder grows. Various anti-government militias and white nationalist groups arrive in each state to support the truckers and take advantage of the chaos. Some of them bring weapons, and violence breaks out in several states. The President calls for a return to order and says that he will meet with the truckers. But the protests morph into many distinct conflicts with unclear demands and fragmented leadership. The riots rage for several weeks and dozens of businesses and drugstores are looted. In the aftermath, there are dozens dead, hundreds injured and arrested, and billions of dollars worth of property damage and economic harm, similar to the Pullman Strike of 1894 that killed 30 people and caused the equivalent of $2.2 billion in damage in response to low wages.Things continue to deteriorate. Hundreds of thousands stop paying taxes because they refuse to support a government that “killed the working man.” A white nationalist party arises that openly advocates “Returning America to its Roots” and “Traditional Gender Roles,” and it wins several state races in the South. A shooter arrives in the lobby of a technology company in San Francisco and wounds several people. Tech companies hire security forces, but 30 percent of employees request to work remotely due to a sense of fear. Several tech companies move to Vancouver citing a desire for employee safety. The California secession movement surges as state officials move to protect the border and implement checkpoints.There is already a nascent movement among technologists, libertarians and others in California to secede on economic grounds—about one-third of Californians supported secession in a recent poll, up considerably from earlier levels. One can imagine California holding a referendum to secede in response to events elsewhere in the country that are perceived as atavistic and regressive. An independent California would be the sixth largest economy in the world. Though unlikely, California’s departure would permanently tilt the country’s political balance, which could be appealing to the party in power.Maybe the scenario I sketched above seems unlikely. To me, it seems depressingly plausible. The truck drivers are obvious but there are dozens of less obvious labor categories that are set to similarly shrink. This vision assumes that we keep our economic system as it is now, measuring economic health by GDP, prioritizing capital efficiency above all, and treating people primarily as economic inputs. The market will continue to drive us in specific directions that will lead to extremes even as opportunities diminish at every turn. And automation will soon make our problems much worse. A NATION ALREADY IN CRISISWe are already suffering the early fallout of increasing automation. Reports of low unemployment are incredibly misleading—our labor participation rate has fallen to 62.7 percent, a multi-decade low, comparable to the rates of El Salvador and the Ukraine. 95 million Americans are out of the workforce, including nearly 1 out of 5 adults of prime working age. Opioid abuse is surging and disability rates are climbing. Our life expectancy has declined for 2 straight years, almost unheard of in a developed country, in part because of a spike in suicides among middle-aged whites. None of this is speculative—it is our reality. The challenges are magnified because American society is not in great shape right now. Public faith in the media and the government are at record lows. This mistrust weakens our ability to recognize what is happening, despite an increasing consensus among experts and scholars. The President of MIT recently declared that it is now the primary mission of the university to help society transition through this automation wave. In another era that would make national headlines and perhaps rally people. Today, it is submerged below the tweet of the day.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.If we do not take big steps to address the growing automation crisis, society will become dramatically bifurcated on levels we can scarcely imagine. There will soon be a shrinking number of affluent people in a handful of megacities and those who cut their hair and take care of their children. There will also be enormous numbers of increasingly destitute and displaced people in decaying towns around the country that the self-driving trucks drive past without stopping. Scholars project a violent revolution if this picture comes to pass. History would suggest that this is exactly what will happen.In his book Ages of Discord, the scholar Peter Turchin proposes a structural theory of political instability based on societies throughout history. He suggests that there are 3 main preconditions to revolution: 1. Elite oversupply and disunity; 2. Popular misery based on falling living standards; and 3. A state in fiscal crisis. He uses a host of variables to measure these conditions, including real wages, marital trends, proportion of children in two-parent households, minimum wage, wealth distribution, college tuition, oversupply of lawyers, political polarization, income tax on the wealthy, trust in government, and other factors.Turchin argues that societies generally experience extended periods of integration and prosperity followed by periods of inequity, increasing misery and political instability that lead to disintegration and revolution—and according to his data, we’re in the midst of the latter. Most of the variables that he measures began trending negatively between 1965 and 1980, and are now reaching near-crisis levels. By his analysis, “the US right now has much in common with the Antebellum 1850s [before the Civil War] and, more surprisingly, with... France on the eve of the French Revolution.” He projects increased turmoil through 2020 and warns that “we are rapidly approaching a historical cusp at which American society will be particularly vulnerable to violent upheaval.”WHERE WE GO FROM HEREForestalling automation and retaining jobs might help. Some would argue we should require that a human sit in every truck, only let doctors look at radiology films, and maintain employment levels in fast food restaurants and call centers indefinitely. However, it would be nearly impossible to curb automation for any prolonged period of time effectively across all industries. The result would be that certain workers and industries would be protected while others in an industry that is less core—like retail, which employs 1 out of 10 American workers—would be quickly displaced.Automation is great for business, and it will likely raise the GDP—but GDP is an incomplete measure. We invented GDP during the Great Depression to see how badly we were doing, but even its inventor, Simon Kuznets, commented at the time that “economic welfare cannot be adequately measured” unless the personal distribution of income is known as well as the “intensity and unpleasantness” that goes into earning it. We can’t stop automation, and we shouldn’t try. Time only flows in one direction, and progress is a good thing as long as its benefits are shared. But in the age of automation, we need to start measuring different things. Freedom from substance abuse, mental health, childhood success, average well-being—all are better indicators of how we are progressing than GDP growth. We need to start steering our economy to serve human goals and values. It is only by changing what we are striving for that we can win this race.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Unpardonable Pardons Send an Ominous Signal',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "What do Dinesh D’Souza, Rod Blagojevich, and Martha Stewart have in common? Yes, they’re at least mildly famous. (Blagojevich was even a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice.) All have been convicted of federal crimes. And they may be the beneficiaries of pardons from President Trump. D’Souza got an unexpected pardon from the president Thursday. Then Trump said he’s considering clemency for the other two.And that’s where things go from weird to very worrisome. Plainly Trump is not just using the pardon power as other presidents have, usually at the end of a term and typically to show mercy. \xa0\xa0Rather, Trump is doing it to send a clear signal to witnesses and prosecutors. Each of these miscreants were convicted of crimes that may have been committed by witnesses against Trump, or by the president himself. \xa0Few expected a pardon for D’Souza, the conservative pundit. He was the incendiary journalist who pleaded guilty to a simple but serious campaign finance violation: funneling $20,000 \xa0through straw donors to evade campaign contribution limits.Blagojevich is serving time in federal prison as we speak. He was the Democratic governor of Illinois convicted of trying to sell off his appointment to fill Barack Obama’s Senate seat. A recording caught him saying, “I’ve got this thing, and it’s [expletive] golden. And I’m just not giving it up for [expletive] nothing.” “These pardons semaphore wavering witnesses. They come as Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and others must decide whether to cooperate with prosecutors.”And Martha Stewart, of course, is the mega-successful lifestyle entrepreneur whose cookbooks, television show and magazines achieved canonical status in the 1980s and 1990s. She was convicted of lying to the FBI about the timing of an investment she made after receiving an inside tip.\xa0She spent five months in prison and has since become a criminal justice reform advocate. Campaign law violations. Public corruption. Lying to the FBI, even when the underlying conduct hadn’t been proved a crime. Now the pattern starts to become clearer. Can we think of anyone else who might have reason to worry about those particular misdeeds?Trump’s pardons already have broken with longstanding practice followed by presidents of both parties. Most consult extensively with the federal pardon attorneys, and applicants go through an exhaustive process. Trump started by pardoning Sherriff Joe Arpaio, a notorious supporter who was found guilty of contempt of court relating to civil rights violations. Presidents long stood behind federal courts, even when they disagreed with the rulings. Think of Dwight Eisenhower sending federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce a federal ruling on school desegregation. Trump’s pardon of Arpaio sent a different message: if you are a supporter, I’ve got your back. No matter what.Then he pardoned Scooter Libby, onetime chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, convicted of lying during a leak investigation around the Iraq war. (The FBI chief when Libby lied was Robert Mueller.) George W. Bush had rejected the idea of pardoning Libby as he left office. Both of these loomed as signals sent to possible witnesses in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump and his defenders will say that he is taking a stand against the criminalization of politics. But there are far more ominous overtones. These pardons semaphore wavering witnesses. They come as Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and others must decide whether to cooperate with prosecutors. Just yesterday Trump’s former advisor Roger Stone vowed to the Daily Beast, “I will never roll on him!” \xa0\xa0They offer a sneering rebuke to law enforcement as well. D’Souza was prosecuted by Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney whom Trump dismissed after he refused to take his call. Today D’Souza tweeted: “KARMA IS A BITCH DEPT: @PreetBharara wanted to destroy a fellow Indian American to advance his career. Then he got fired & I got pardoned.” (Bharara works with my organization, the Brennan Center, as cochair of a national Task Force on the Rule of Law and Democracy.) And James Comey prosecuted Martha Stewart, describing in his recent book how he wrestled with whether to bring charges.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Of course, the specific crimes committed by these individuals may map the very charges that one could imagine being brought against Trump himself. \xa0The overall message couldn’t be clearer: public corruption isn’t really a crime. And the pardon power is there to be used to make sure that nobody is truly held accountable. His defenders note that the pardon power is in the Constitution. True. But a pardon that is given for improper reasons can still be a criminal act. When Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Marc Rich as he was leaving office, a criminal investigation probed whether there was improper inducement. No charges were brought, but few Republicans then howled about the inviolate pardon power.In fact, the articles of impeachment against Richard M. Nixon that were passed by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 included a count charging Nixon with dangling clemency before the burglars. When Trump’s lawyers discussed the pardons with Michael Flynn, they came dangerously close to outright obstruction of justice. This is far subtler. None of these people are caught up in Trump’s metastasizing scandals. But their misconduct looks awfully familiar. \xa0We’ve been lucky that so far, Trump has been hamfisted in his attempts to undermine the Russia probe and other investigations. Ominously, when it comes to abuse of power, he appears to be learning on the job. Michael Waldman is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. He is the author, most recently, of The Fight to Vote. "},
 {'title': 'Supreme Court Sides With Anti-Gay Baker. It’s Not a Loss for LGBT Equality.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Everyone is going to say the Supreme Court’s ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop is a win for the Christian baker who refused to bake a cake for a same-sex couple.\xa0They’re wrong.\xa0This case was forfeited by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.In the Court’s 7-2 opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court decided the case on narrow, and unusual, grounds: that the commission was actively hostile to the religious beliefs of the baker, Jack Phillips. As a result, the Court’s opinion didn’t reach the deeper issues underneath, and we know no more about them than we did before the case came down.That’s why the vote was 7-2: because, in the end, this was an easy case. The issues underneath are hard: they are about the conflict between the First Amendment and rights to be free from discrimination. Is a cake “speech?”  Did Phillips refuse to bake a generic cake for gay people, or did he refuse to bake a special gay-wedding cake? When does a sincere religious belief justify discrimination, and when doesn’t it?The answer is, we still don’t know.What we do know is that the Colorado commission royally messed up, calling Phillips’ beliefs “irrational” and “offensive.” Agree or disagree with that characterization, passing such judgment is not the government’s business. That’s how Justices Kagan and Gorsuch were able to agree on the outcome of this case. The First Amendment requires government officials to be neutral toward religion, and the Colorado civil rights commission was not.“The Civil Rights Commission’s treatment of [Phillips’] case,” Justice Kennedy wrote, “has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.”It didn’t help that the commission also failed to explain why Phillips was being treated differently from a baker who refused to bake a cake with an anti-gay message.\xa0Justice Kagan, in her concurring opinion, actually set forth how the commission could have distinguished the cases: Phillips refused to serve gay people, whereas the other baker refused to bake that cake for anyone.\xa0But the commission didn’t do that.\xa0It just said that the anti-gay cake was offensive and the gay-wedding cake wasn’t.“The First Amendment requires government officials to be neutral toward religion, and the Colorado civil rights commission was not.”Even the Court’s opinion hinted at this point: “While the issues here are difficult to resolve, it must be concluded that the State’s interest could have been weighed against Phillips’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed.” In other words, this would have been a hard case had the commission done its job right. But it didn’t, and so this became an easy one.If the Colorado commission was the big loser in Masterpiece Cakeshop, in a way the big winner is Justice Kennedy.Over the past several months, commentators like me have wondered how Kennedy could (sorry about this) “have his cake and eat it too” in this case.  On the one hand, Kennedy is the author of every major LGBT opinion in recent Supreme Court history, and he has never ruled against LGBT people.  On the other hand, Kennedy is a vaunted free-speech libertarian, and it was hard to see how he, as the likely swing vote, could ever compel a baker to write words on a cake that he didn’t want to write.Well, he found a way.  Gay Americans just received another helping of powerful, even moving, judicial rhetoric. “Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth,” Justice Kennedy wrote. “For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.And yet, on the other hand, “The official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners’ comments… were inconsistent with what the Free Exercise Clause requires.”With Justice Kennedy occupying the center, that left four other opinions to argue the case we all expected. Justice Kagan (joined by Justice Breyer) wrote separately to emphasize that had the case been properly presented, Phillips would have lost. Justice Gorsuch (joined by Justice Alito) wrote to say that Phillips probably would have won. Justice Thomas (joined by Justice Gorsuch) wrote to say Phillips would also have won on free speech grounds.And Justice Ginsberg (joined by Justice Sotomayor) dissented, arguing that the hostile comments were only by certain members of the civil rights commission, that Phillips’s refusal to sell a cake to a gay couple is what is more important, and that it cannot be allowed to stand.  If you tally up those concurring and dissenting opinions, you’ve got three for the baker and four against, leaving only Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy unaccounted for. Which is what most commentators knew going in: that this was going to come down to the two of them.  So, where do we go from here?On a rhetorical level, the Christian Right is going to cheer this as a huge victory for religious freedom. Already, they have filed numerous follow-up cases, hoping to extend Masterpiece Cakeshop to florists, photographers, for-profit wedding halls, even lawyers and doctors. Just because of how it was decided, the case is a win for the right in its ongoing “culture war.” And Jack Phillips can refuse to sell cakes to same-sex couples.On an actual legal level, though, this case says almost nothing. Because of the commission’s open hostility to Phillips’s religious beliefs, we don’t know what would happen in a more neutral case. As we’ve just seen, the current vote on that question is 4 to 3, with the two swing votes abstaining.Indeed, even Phillips himself could well be re-sanctioned by the Colorado civil rights commission, using the rationale that Justice Kagan has helpfully laid out in her opinion. There is nothing in the Court’s judgment prohibiting the commission from doing so, although they may find it more politic to let it go.  Essentially, all this case says is “when enforcing civil rights laws, the government must be neutral toward religious claims.” And we knew that already. This case says nothing."},
 {'title': 'Trump White House Offered to Help Prep Scott Pruitt for Hearings. EPA Told the White House to ‘Get Lost’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt faces a make-or-break moment on Thursday, when he’s slated for a pair of congressional hearings, but he’ll be heading to the Hill without the full backing of the Trump White House.Two sources familiar with Pruitt’s preparation for the hearing say that the EPA has turned down an offer from the White House to help prepare the administrator for what is sure to be a bruising few hours of questions about the ethics and government spending controversies that have dogged him of late.One of the sources, a White House official, characterized the EPA’s response to the West Wing as “get lost.” The White House and the EPA declined to comment.The agency’s rebuke of the West Wing’s offer is just the latest episode in an increasingly tense relationship between Pruitt, once one of Trump’s preferred federal officials, and a White House senior staff that has increasingly distanced itself from the embattled EPA leader of late.A Bloomberg story on Monday, which reported that the White House was discouraging allies from publicly defending Pruitt, further exacerbated those tensions, according to one source familiar with the dispute. EPA officials privately questioned the wisdom of putting Pruitt’s fate in the hands of presidential aides who are apparently less than committed to his political survival.That view cemented on Tuesday with the leak of internal White House discussions that questioned whether Pruitt should remain in his post.The lack of White House input on Pruitt’s upcoming testimony will leave the administrator to fend for himself in what is expected to be a highly hostile environment. He is slated to testify before House Appropriations and Energy and Commerce panels, and will likely face questions about his expensive travel habits, his spending on internal security measures, and the months that he spent living in a Washington DC condo owned by the wife of a prominent energy lobbyist.Pruitt has earned President Trump’s trust through his persistent advocacy of a conservative energy and environmental agenda, including the rollback of major Obama-era regulations. But EPA officials suspect that that goodwill does not extend to most of the president’s staff, who have struggled to deal with cascading scandals involving high-level Trump administration officials, resulting in the resignations of two cabinet members so far.There has been a now months-long erosion of trust and cooperation between Pruitt’s EPA and the senior ranks of Trump’s West Wing. When White House officials requested travel records from the EPA as part of an internal probe into Pruitt’s penchant for first class flights, EPA declined to provide the records, instead handing them over to congressional investigators. The concern, sources told The Daily Beast at the time, was that damaging information about Trump cabinet officials has been known to leak from the West Wing.Early this month, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly conveyed to Pruitt in a phone call that, though he had the full public confidence of President Trump for now, the flow of damning news stories needed to stop.“[It] was not a friendly buck-up call at all,” one Trump administration official described the conversation.'},

  'body': 'Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat from El Paso, has raised an eye-popping $6.7 million plus in the first quarter of 2018, his Senate campaign announced early Tuesday. First reported by The Texas Tribune, the cumulative total came from more than 141,000 contributions as O’Rourke mounts an aggressive campaign against incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). “We’re absolutely running this race the right way—not taking any PAC money, going to every single county and holding town halls across Texas where anyone can ask any question,” O’Rourke said in a statement provided to The Daily Beast. “Campaigning in a grassroots fashion while raising more than $6.7 million from 141,000 contributions, we are the story of a campaign powered by people who are standing up to special interests, proving that we are more than a match and making it clear that Texans are willing to do exactly what our state and country need of us at this critical time.”It is the biggest fundraising haul the campaign has had since O’Rourke entered the race and the largest amount any Democratic Senate candidate brought in for last quarter. In three of the four Federal Election Commission reporting periods so far, O’Rourke has outraised Cruz cumulatively, the campaign said. Cruz has not yet released figures for this particular quarter prior to the April 15 reporting deadline to the FEC. '},
 {'title': 'It’s Time for John Kelly to Shape Up or Go',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Idiot, moron, unhinged. There’s a whole section of the thesaurus for the ways that the President’s closest advisors have reportedly described him. The latest addition to this thread comes from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly who reportedly referred to his boss as an idiot. Kelly says it’s a lie. But either way, the episode is part of an ongoing series of leaks, from the White House, that raise questions about Kelly’s ability to manage the place. After all, a chief of staff who not only can’t control leaks in general, but can’t even control leaks about himself, doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence.All of which begs the question: why General Kelly is still around? The answer is, he shouldn’t be, at least not unless he steps up soon. Right now, we have deadweight in the chief of staff’s office. It’s the worst kept secret in Washington that morale at the White House is at an all time low. There are many reasons for this—from the Russia investigation to the Stormy scandal and more. But Kelly hasn’t helped matters either. Who can forget his comments that God was punishing him by moving him from DHS to the White House; or how he told reporters that Rex Tillerson was in the bathroom when he fired him? Even if he didn’t call Trump an idiot, the example he’s set is that he thinks working at the White House is punishment and he’s comfortable humiliating cabinet members. \xa0As Kelly laments his professional lot in life, that lot also seems to be growing smaller. We learned earlier this month that National Security Advisor John Bolton and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow no longer reports to Kelly (they now have a direct line to the President), and the President’s inner, inner circle (his family) have had free rein to operate outside of Kelly’s orbit from the get go.So, who, with actual influence is reporting to the chief of staff? If the primary foreign policy and domestic policy bodies don’t, it’s a logical conclusion that he could be in the dark on key decisions, including everything from which foreign visitors come to the White House, to when and how to unveil major trade initiatives. Those are pretty weighty issues to be left out of.But even if he does have more free time, it’s not clear what Kelly is doing with it. It wasn’t so long ago that he was supposedly doing a review of the security clearance process at the White House in the wake of the Rob Porter scandal. He even issued a five-page memo that said the White House would “discontinue any Top Secret or SCI-level interim clearances for individuals whose investigations or adjudications have been pending since June 1, 2017 or before.” The result, apparently, was the downgrading of Jared Kushner’s security clearance—a decision that Trump said he’d respect. But Jared is still talking to foreign officials on behalf of the U.S. government, much of which is done above a secret level. He’s still, from what we know, participating in national security meetings (again, much of which is done above a secret level).It is true that the President can give Kushner access to any level of intelligence that he wants. But it’s also true that in doing so he’s completely neutering Kelly. Processes and procedures, as established by an empowered chief of staff, don’t get family carve-outs. And therein lies the main problem Kelly faces. He doesn’t actually have control at all, it appears. Take the president’s schedule. Determining it each day takes great skill. My former colleagues on the scheduling team were experts at working with various parts of the White House on President Obama’s schedule and working with the chief of staff to ensure that the president was using his time efficiently, productively, and in a presidential manner.

The entire world knows that free time in front of the TV is not good for the president. It sets him off, he tweets something inaccurate or offensive, his team tries to clean up the mess or plant another story to distract us, and we lose a lot of time. And yet, Trump seems glued to the TV and keen on venting his frustrations on twitter.There’s a know-your-customer rule in every job, and the chief of staff has to know what kinds of environments are good or bad for the President. Kelly is failing to abide by that rule. Perhaps he’s found it impossible to grapple with. The uncomfortable truth is, it’s likely that President Trump considers himself his own chief of staff. Just like he considers himself his own communications director. But that doesn’t mean that we should accept a deadweight in that critical job. Yes, the risks are enormously high if a change are to be made. Donald Trump could centralize the chief of staff responsibilities in his own office, which would mean that he could really operate unchecked. I cringe to think about what that would look like. But the upsides are high too. An empowered chief of staff that has access and influence over the President and the staff he (or she) is supposed to be managing is no small matter. It’s the difference between a dysfunctional executive branch and a functioning one. Maybe the answer lies somewhere on the spectrum, but what we can’t do is accept this status quo. \xa0Kelly was supposed to be the one who brought order and a touch of sanity to the current operation. But it hasn’t happened.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "There’s a special place in hell for people who dance on your grave before you’re even dead. This is especially true when you have served and sacrificed for your country. Yet, this is the kind of nastiness some are showing John McCain in the eleventh hour of his life.Consider the case of Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to Donald Trump, who tweeted a meme of McCain saying he doesn’t want Trump at his funeral, juxtaposed with a picture of President Trump saying, “I’ll celebrate from home then.” It was in response to the revelation by New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin that McCain’s friends “have informed the White House that their current plan for his funeral is for Vice President Mike Pence to attend the service to be held in Washington’s National Cathedral but not President Trump…” If ever one should get to control his own invite list, a funeral seems like the appropriate place. And who could blame McCain for preferring Trump not grace his family with his company? After all, this is the same Trump who previously suggested that McCain wasn’t a war hero (“I like people who weren’t captured”). Or consider the case of Glenn Greenwald, who chose this occasion to hit McCain from the left (although it’s so hard to define what that even means nowadays). “John McCain has spent the last 60 years advocating, cheering for and glorifying the most monstrous and murderous wars on the planet, while demanding many others that never happened,” Greenwald tweeted. “He has enormous amounts of blood on his hands. That he’s dying of brain cancer doesn’t change this.”“If Sam Nunberg died tomorrow, what could we say about him? That he died before being indicted?”Of course, some of the worst stuff comes from people you’ve never heard of—and wouldn’t hear of if it weren’t for Twitter. I’ll save you from rehashing the worst examples coming from those fever swamps, but as Bill Kristol noted, “Anti-McCain twitter seems to have reached new heights (or depths) of repulsiveness.” And I echo Jonah Goldberg’s sentiments: “I have political disagreements — from quibbles to more significant—with John McCain. But all of these self-described conservatives using the man’s funeral wishes to piss on his whole life just to prove their love of Trump are debasing themselves. It’s grotesque.”In some ways, this unseemly nastiness is the result of the unchivalrous times we live in. But this backlash is, in many ways, a reflection of a career McCain spent doing bold things. Sometimes those things were incredibly stupid (like pausing his 2008 campaign to deal with the market collapse) or unethical (the Keating Five scandal) or dangerous (his penchant for saber rattling). Sometimes they were heroic (refusing to leave the Hanoi Hilton ahead of his comrades—and then standing up against torture) or heroic for the media’s portrayal purposes, but annoying for conservatives (calling out the Bush tax cuts, voting no on the Obamacare repeal, etc.).Some of these things were good and some of these things were bad—but you can’t say they weren’t significant. In that vein, of course it makes sense that one bold choice he didn’t make—picking Joe Lieberman as his running mate—haunts him to this day. And of course it makes sense that a number of people he agitated over the years (from those aforementioned conservatives to Greenwald) are also piling on now. One imagines this is merely the opening salvo in a fight to define his legacy. With apologies to Donald Trump, John McCain was, by virtue of his extraordinary service in Vietnam, an American hero. But he wasn’t a perfect political leader, for such a thing does not exist. McCain’s biggest political asterisks are those occasions when he made political decisions (such as his failure to engage in straight talk about the Confederate flag during the 2000 Republican primary to his selection of Sarah Palin—which at the time was a completely rational and defensible strategic move). But he is also a man who has always endured vicious attacks. Who could forget the scurrilous accusations in 2000 that he fathered an illegitimate black child with an African-American prostitute? This is nothing new for John McCain. His has been a life of ups and downs, rights and wrongs, but also of heroism and purpose. The evil things people say about him as he heads into his next journey say more about them that they do about him. To be honest, I don’t think McCain minds it one bit. Every one of us will die, and we must all grapple with how we lived our lives here on earth. Did we, for example, sacrifice for a cause larger than our own self interest?

 {'title': 'EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s Lobbyist-Owned Pad Was GOP Fundraising Hub',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The lobbyist-owned townhouse that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rented for relatively small nightly sums also served as a hub for Republican lawmakers hoping to raise money for their congressional campaigns. A review of fundraising invitations reveals that at least three members of Congress had fundraisers at the now-controversial Capital Hill brownstone during the same period of time that Pruitt was living there. Several of those fundraisers took place on dates when Pruitt was in Washington, D.C.,\xa0according to a cross-reference of the invitations and Pruitt’s schedule. The EPA said that Pruitt wasn’t invited to and didn’t attend any of the events. And even if he were to have attended, ethics laws do not prohibit a cabinet secretary from going to a political event in his or her personal time. While Pruitt wasn’t in town for all of the events, the cross-pollination of Pruitt’s lobbyist-owned accommodations and the apparently common fundraising activity raises another round of questions over how the EPA chief conducted himself upon arriving in Washington. “Nothing says ‘the swamp’ like corporate lobbyists holding high-dollar fundraisers in a luxury Capitol Hill condo,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit ethics group. “The fact that a senior member of the administration is staying in a lobbyist’s fundraiser den when he isn’t flying first class on the taxpayer dime might say something about President Trump’s commitment to his ‘Drain the Swamp’ pledge.”The townhouse at 223 C Street, NE, is owned by Vicki Hart and her husband J. Steven Hart, who chairs one of D.C.’s major lobbying firms and represents, among other clients, major energy companies. According to ABC News, Pruitt lived at the address during the spring and early summer of 2017, paying a rate of $50-a-night—well below a standard fare for someone renting out prime real estate on the Hill.The EPA says the relationship was entirely above board. A spokesperson for the agency provided a memo from its chief ethics attorney, who reviewed the arrangement retroactively and found that it fully complied with relevant laws and regulations. But the White House said on Monday that it was conducting its own review of the practice to ensure it was above board, according to a Wall Street Journal report.During those months that Pruitt stayed in the house—from March through July, according to records reported by Bloomberg—political action committees associated with several members of Congress held fundraisers at 223 C Street, NE as well. They include Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID), who hosted, what appears to be, monthly luncheons. A request for comment made to Crapo’s Freedom Fund was not returned. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) held a breakfast fundraiser at the townhouse on March 9, 2017. A treasurer for “Huizenga for Congress” did not return a request for comment. And Save America PAC, the political action committee for Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), also held an event at the house in mid-July, according a source familiar with the event. A request for comment from that PAC was similarly not returned. A request for comment made to Steven Hart’s office was not returned. Pruitt was in Washington, D.C., on the same day of at least three of the Crapo fundraisers (he was in Oklahoma for a fourth). He was in Little Rock, Arkansas, on the date of the Risch fundraiser and in Houston during the Huizenga event (his publicly released schedule does not go back that far). Though the events took place at his residence, most of them were in the middle of the day which would have made it difficult for Pruitt to have attended.Pruitt was out of town for some of the events, and might not have even known they were taking place. But Fischer insists that that’s almost beside the point.“Even if that is true,” he said, “the fact that fundraisers were a common occurrence is a reminder that Pruitt was getting a sweet deal on a luxury condo from a couple whose job is influence-peddling.”'},
 {'title': 'Republicans Stay on the Right Side of Trump, Wrong Side of History',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "March Madness in Washington comes down to guessing who will bring down Trump: the porn star, the playboy bunny, and the reality TV contestant, or special counsel Robert Mueller. Come Sunday, it will look like Stormy Daniels will be the one to plunge a dagger in the Trump presidency, with her up close and personal interview, complete with photos and stories, on 60 Minutes. Thursday, it looked like the abrupt resignation of Trump’s attorney John Dowd that could mark the beginning of the end. Dowd was the lead outside criminal lawyer, pugnacious, wily, but above all seasoned in the ways of prosecutors—the most likely to succeed in containing the Mueller probe, if contained it can be.\xa0It was clear he was restive over the weekend; he told The Daily Beast that it was time for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to “bring an end” to the investigation, an obvious ploy not intended for Rosenstein but to make the client feel momentarily better. First Dowd said the advice came from the president, then corrected that to say it was his, demonstrating how difficult it is to placate a client who believes he could do a much better job if only he could represent himself. Dowd was gracious in his resignation, wishing the president well. But not so the president.\xa0Just as the White House let it be known that when former secretary of state got a heads-up he was about to be fired he was on the toilet, word is out that Dowd, like Jeb Bush, didn’t have the “energy” for the job. In fact, he will be hard to replace. No respected lawyer wants the job; former Solicitor General Ted Olson turned it down a few days ago. Dowd’s likely replacement is Marc Kasowitz whose experience runs to representing Trump in his bankruptcies, Trump University, divorces, and sexual misconduct cases. He flamed out in an earlier stint in the White House after he threatened a woman who urged him to resign after reports of alcohol abuse came out, telling her “Watch your back, bitch,” and “I know where you live.”\xa0He’s no John Dowd.\xa0 But there may be no bracket buster in Washington—neither the special counsel nor so many women with complaints about Trump they could file a class action suit—as long as Republicans do little more than clear their throats when Trump’s conduct comes up. Sex scandals that would make Hugh Hefner blush are baked in to Trump’s cake, excused by his base, and party “leaders” who follow their lead. Even sex-averse Mike Pence gave Trump a pass over boasting about grabbing lady parts the Sooner barely knew existed before the Access Hollywood tape. More recently, the vice president has given no signal that he’s troubled by the president allegedly cheating on his wife with a porn star at the same time he was cheating on the porn star with a playboy bunny who is, herself, appearing on CNN Thursday night. No one in the GOP is much upset over lawyer Michael Cohen’s wet work for the boss, complete with forged documents, aliases, and the first known instance of using a home equity loan for hush money. That elaborate scheme fell apart when the genius Trump blew it up by personally filing a suit this week to gag Daniels, officially outing himself as the David Dennison of the secret nondisclosure agreement. All this to keep Daniels’ 60 Minutes interview from airing this Sunday and revealing, perhaps, that his hands are small, after all.\xa0Just this week Trump lost his bid to stop the defamation case brought by Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos—a suit he could have easily avoided if he’d had an ounce of self-control. The statute of limitations had run on the 2007 encounters, it was long before #MeToo, and his usual denials had deep-sixed her story. But he got mad, tweeted out a picture of her (one of his defenses in the court of public opinion has been that many of his accusers are not attractive enough to merit his gropes), and called her a liar.\xa0A New York state judge, citing Clinton v. Jones, ruled that her suit can proceed and rejected the president’s contention that he’s simply too important to be sued. Maybe Trump was right about shooting someone on Fifth Avenue with impunity. These days, to paraphrase a former Louisiana governor, it would take a dead girl or a live boy, and in the Lincoln Bedroom, for Trump’s\xa0remaining base to abandon him. Republican officials are too afraid of becoming Sen. Jeff Flake, whose numbers dropped so sharply after his book criticizing Trump that he decided to retire. Or Sen. Bob Corker. He described the West Wing as an adult day care center and World War III as a possibility, but only after deciding that he wouldn’t be running for re-election, hiniring his 2006 pledge to Tennesseans to serve only two terms. The women aside, firing Mueller used to look like the one line Trump couldn’t cross but that’s blurring now, with Dowd’s departure. Republicans say it would be a constitutional crisis should Trump do it, but he probably won’t, so there’s no rush to do anything to deter him. This even as Trump ratchets up his public statements ripping the pesky prosecutor he hopes to be rid of, and doing so by name now. He’s said to be newly emboldened, on top of his job, shorn of advisers he tired of, uninterested in those who remain, and convinced of his own rightness about everything. Why not float firing Mueller again? Trump’s latest agitation over Mueller comes as the counsel gets hold of his financial files, portending scrutiny of his board-less, unaccountable, seat-of-the-pants business operation. Trump had assiduously avoided such scrutiny until now, not least by breaking post-Watergate precedent and refusing to release his taxes. The Trump family’s extensive dealings with dubious Russian figures may partly explain Trump’s preference for Putin above all others. Eric Trump told a reporter in 2014\xa0that\xa0Russians were the primary investors in their golf courses and Donald Jr. said the same was so for all their investments. Trump took his Miss Universe pageant to Moscow to attract more money from oligarchs and to meet Putin.\xa0Trump’s buildings are chock full of Russians who may use the properties to launder money. Trump sold a Palm Beach property he paid $41 million for to a Russian tycoon for $95 million.

Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, a vocal Trump critic, lent Trump\xa0an escape clause, warning the president not to stop the investigation “without cause.” Does that sound like someone who’s going to lead a move to impeach Trump? “Cause” is something Trump’s spent months fabricating, delegitimizing our democratic institutions in the process as a chorus of lawmakers echo his attacks. The president has relentlessly attacked the F.B.I., which framed him with fabricated evidence according to Trump’s newly hired attorney Joseph DiGenova. It’s so corrupt that former director James Comey and onetime acting director Andrew McCabe had to go. The judiciary is biased. There’s no civil service, just a deep state. The media spews fake news. And now Trump is, more or less, surrounded by lawyers who will let him provide his own counsel which is to end Mueller’s investigation, despite what he says about welcoming the opportunity to testify. A few days ago, he said how happy he was with Dowd. Look where he is now. There’s still time for Graham to stiffen his spine and bring others with him. There is no known cause that justifies firing Mueller. To be on the wrong side of Trump will put you on the right side of history."},
 {'title': 'Bill Clinton Meltdown on Monica Lewinsky Scandal: I Did the Right Thing',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Bill Clinton has revealed he never personally apologized to Monica Lewinsky, in an interview in which he became visibly uncomfortable while being grilled about the #MeToo movement.Asked if he should have resigned from the White House, Clinton said he had "done the right thing" and "defended the Constitution" by staying on through the impeachment process. Clinton was on the Today show Monday to promote his upcoming novel, The President Is Missing, he became riled during his interview with Craig Melvin, particularly upon being asked if he felt worse about his behavior toward Lewinsky in the wake of #MeToo.Lewinsky previously said the #MeToo movement had made her re-evaluate her affair with Clinton and the nature of sexual consent. Writing in Vanity Fair in March, she said: “[Clinton] was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet. He was 27 years my senior, with enough life experience to know better. He was, at the time, at the pinnacle of his career, while I was in my first job out of college.”Asked if he thought differently about his affair through the lens of #MeToo, Clinton said no because he felt “terrible” about it at the time. The former president then became defensive over his record on gender equality, and accused the interviewer of failing to understand the Lewinsky case.“You, typically, have ignored gaping facts in describing this and I bet you don’t even know them,” said Clinton. “This was litigated 20 years ago. Two-thirds of the American people sided with me.”He added: “I had a sexual-harassment policy when I was governor in the ’80s. I had two women chiefs of staff when I was governor. Women were over-represented in the attorney general’s office in the ’70s. I’ve had nothing but women leaders in my office since I left. You are giving one side and omitting facts.”Clinton revealed he has never apologized personally to Lewinsky, saying: “I have never talked to her, but I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry. That’s very different. The apology was public.”Clinton went on to ask the interviewer if he believed that President Kennedy or President Johnson should have resigned over their alleged affairs, before shutting down Melvin’s line of questioning.“Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions,” said Clinton. “I dealt with it 20 years ago plus and the American people, two-thirds of them stayed with me. And I’ve tried to do a good job since then with my life and with my work. That’s all I have to say.”Speaking after the interview aired on Today, Melvin said that Clinton remarked to him off-camera that “standards in society have changed” in the wake of #MeToo, which, Clinton said, was a good thing.“[Clinton] also reiterated how the facts of his case make it very different from some of the high-profile cases that have been spawned as a result of #MeToo,” said Melvin.'},
 {'title': 'Michael Cohen Scandal Goes Supernova With Foreign Money',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Michael Cohen scandal began as a six-figure payment to a porn star, but on Wednesday it exploded into an international, multimillion-dollar financial scandal.President Donald Trump’s fixer took in more than $4 million in eyebrow-raising deposits to his shell company—much of it from foreign sources. That’s what a law-enforcement official told The New Yorker, saying the information Stormy Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti and then news outlets have been reporting on over the last week—about the money pouring into the same shell company Cohen used to funnel $130,000 to the adult actress—came from a “suspicious activity report” filed by a bank with the Treasury Department. The report detailed $1 million in deposits into the company that Cohen told the bank was for real-estate consulting. However, bank officers reported the deposits came from entities with “no apparent connection to real estate or apparent need to engage Cohen as a real estate consultant.” The official told The New Yorker that two other suspicious activity reports, not previously reported on, showed another $3 million in deposits to Cohen’s company. All three reports were sent by the bank to the Treasury Department’s criminal bureau, but the official said he was motivated to share the first report because the two other ones are not in the database of the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Fearing a government cover-up, the official said he leaked the remaining report.A “significant portion” of deposits to Cohen’s company were “derived from foreign entities,” bank officers wrote. Those include a $150,000 payment from a South Korean aerospace firm, which FBI agents are said to be investigating. A translator for Korea Aerospace Industries told The Washington Post that the firm paid Cohen’s company for legal advice about U.S. accounting procedures. Cohen is a former personal injury attorney with “no known experience in government accounting,” the Post notes. KAI is partnered with U.S.-based defense contractor Lockheed Martin in vying for a $16 million contract to provide jets to the U.S. Air Force.Cohen also allegedly asked for foreign money from a Qatari investor during a meeting in Trump Tower during the presidential transition period. Ahmed al-Rumaihi, who was the head of a $100 billion Qatari investment fund, told The Intercept that he asked Cohen what U.S. projects the fund should back in December 2016. But Cohen asked for an up-front fee of $1 million, al-Rumaihi said. (Al-Rumaihi said he did not pay Cohen, and Cohen denied he asked for money.) Cohen is currently under investigation by the public corruption unit of Manhattan federal prosecutors, which investigates crimes such as bribery, embezzlement, and frauds committed against government agencies. Prosecutors and FBI agents raided Cohen’s home and office last month to seize documents, phones, and more. Meanwhile, new information came out about Cohen that undercut his former boss’ claims he had nothing to do with Daniels or with Russia during the campaign.After insisting for months he knew nothing about Cohen’s payoff to Daniels, Trump filed a financial disclosure form Wednesday that said he “fully reimbursed” Cohen in 2017 for expenses incurred in 2016—an apparent reference to the $130,000 Cohen’s company paid Daniels in October of that year to silence her allegation of an affair with Trump a decade earlier.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Cohen had told congressional investigators he stopped pursuing the project in January 2016, but they reportedly obtained text messages between Cohen and his former business associate Felix Sater showing the effort lasted into May 2016.Sater told Cohen that “high-level figures in Russia needed to be involved because a project of this magnitude could not be completed without Putin’s approval,” according to Yahoo News. “Around the start of that year, Cohen became frustrated because Sater had not been able to set up the necessary meetings. Cohen swore at Sater and said he would make his own high-level contacts in Russia.”Cohen, who was a lawyer for the Trump Organization, was apparently invited to an economic forum in St. Petersburg but he declined to go, saying any travel to Russia would have to wait until after the GOP convention. Cohen told congressional investigators he never went."},

  'body': "A former Arizona lawmaker who performed an honest-to-God mic-drop after he was expelled from the state legislature over numerous sexual harassment allegations has filed a $1.3 million claim against the speaker of the House and the governor’s chief of staff.Rep. Don Shooter was ousted on Feb. 1 following a 75-page report that allegedly included “credible” harassment accusations from seven different women, including fellow lawmakers and lobbyists.Shooter argues in a notice of claim filed on Monday that he was targeted by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s office because of his work to unveil fraud in the state’s procurement system. He also claimed that House Speaker J.D. Mesnard changed the chamber’s policies on harassment in order to prematurely remove him from his chairmanship.“All of this was done to ensure only one possible result: the removal of Representative Shooter to prevent him from his efforts to understand and highlight serious issues of malfeasance in state government contracts,” the 17-page notice of claim says. “No Legislature in the history of Arizona has considered the expulsion of a member without engaging a special or ethics committee consisting of elected members, and providing basic elements of fair disciplinary processes.”The Republican has said he wants the matter to go to trial so that he can clear his name.“Mr. Shooter has a compelling story to tell, backed up by the evidence,” his lawyer, Kraig Marton, wrote in the court documents. “He looks forward to the process and his opportunity in a setting, that this time, will include his right to due process.”Gov. Ducey, in a comment to the Associated Press, denied the allegations in Shooter’s notice of claim and described the charges therein as nothing more than “desperate claims by a disgraced, ousted lawmaker.” Mesnard did not provide comment to the news agency.Shooter was first accused of harassment by fellow Republican Rep. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who went public with claims against him in November, after the #MeToo movement began spreading throughout the country. In response, Shooter accused Ugenti-Rita of sexual misconduct.Soon afterward, the speaker ordered an investigation to look into both matters, and the resulting report found that there was “no credible evidence” of the allegations against Ugenti-Rita.That same 75-page report, however, did conclude that Shooter had engaged in “repeated pervasive conduct (that) created a hostile work environment for his colleagues and those with business before the Legislature,” according to The Arizona Republic.State Rep. Athena Salman, who has also accused the lawmaker of making explicit comments, lauded Ugenti-Rita for coming forward with her allegations, according to the newspaper.“I want to publicly and personally thank my colleague for her courage to speak,” said the Democrat, as she reportedly teared up. “It’s gone on for way too long.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Everyone else around here thinks it. I’m the only one who has the balls to say it.”According to the report, “he grabbed his entire crotch, and then shook it. [The lobbyist] said she could see the outline of his genital area.”Shooter later issued an apology for using “jarring, insensitive, and demeaning” language but denied ever trying to touch his accusers. “I stood on the carpet, I took it like a man, I apologized,” Shooter said in a floor speech on the day of his expulsion, after which he reportedly held out his arm and dropped the microphone on his desk before walking off the floor. He was expelled in a 56-3 vote.Later that day, he told The Arizona Republic: “I’ve been thrown out of better places than this.”"},

  'body': 'A photo of a county council candidate in South Carolina posing in blackface at a college party appeared online this week, outraging some community members. But Brant Tomlinson, the Republican running for the Kershaw County Council District 5 seat, said he had no idea the photo would court controversy—and claims his getup was merely an homage to Cool Runnings.Tomlinson insisted the photo, which shows him wearing black face paint and a black shirt bearing the colors of the Jamaican flag, was spread by “an antagonist” who was paid off by a rival candidate in an attempt \xa0to  “misrepresent” his character. The 10-year-old photo first circulated on Facebook and was taken during a college Halloween party, WACH FOX reported Tuesday. “It is unfortunate that local candidates have now resorted to the same type of toxic smear campaigns that have infected the political discourse at state and national level,” Tomlinson said in a statement to WACH FOX. The University of South Carolina graduate also told The State that he intentionally chose not to delete the photo when scanning his social-media profiles prior to running for public office. “I think that’s one thing wrong with politicians: They try to hide everything they do,” Tomlinson told the newspaper. “I never in a million years really thought that would get a negative connotation on it.”The Camden native, who did not apologize for the photo, said in his statement that Cool Runnings, the cult classic about a Jamaican bobsled team, is one of his “all-time favorite movies.” Tomlinson did not respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast, but he told WACH FOX that he “wishes he would have known how his decision in the past would affect others.” “It shows that you have a sense of privilege that doesn’t extend your consciousness level in thinking about who you’re offending,” Phyllis Lloyd-Harris, the head of the Kershaw County Democratic Party, told The Daily Beast. “It is not haha funny to me, as an African-American, to dress in blackface or any other stereotype of what you think black people are.” The Kershaw County Council election is less than a month away, on June 12. There is no mention of the blackface photo on Tomlinson’s campaign Facebook account, but a local pastor endorses him in a video posted on Tuesday. \xa0“I know Brant’s convictions, his values, and most of all I know his heart,” Jed Bryant said in the video.

  'body': "Michael Cohen had as a client Fox News host Sean Hannity, Cohen's lawyers were forced to reveal in a Manhattan federal courtroom on Monday. Cohen, a lawyer for President Donald Trump, was present at a hearing where his attorneys challenged the FBI’s seizure last week of documents he claims are protected by attorney-client privilege. The lawyers told a judge last week that “thousands” of seized documents may be privileged, but they declined to name Cohen’s clients. On Monday, the lawyers wrote to the judge that Cohen had three recent clients: President Donald Trump; Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy, for whom he negotiated respective non-disclosure agreements with alleged mistresses; and a third unnamed individual. Calling the third client a “publicly prominent individual,” Cohen’s attorney, Steve Ryan, offered to disclose the name only to Judge Kimba Wood. \xa0“I’m simply trying to protect the privacy of that individual,” he said.After much discussion, Judge Wood ruled that the name must be publicly disclosed immediately.“The client's name is Sean Hannity,” Harrison said, to audible gasps and laughter in the courtroom. While Hannity said he has sought legal advice from Cohen, he said Cohen “never represented me in any matter.” Hannity said on Twitter the advice was “almost exclusively about real estate.”Hannity added via a spokesperson that he “assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third party.”On his radio show following the news, Hannity didn’t say why he worked with Cohen. Though he said he may have “handed Cohen ten bucks” to establish attorney-client privilege, Hannity said he never worked with him on “any specific matter.”Further, the Fox News host added that the advice he sought was unrelated to “any matter with him between me and a third party.”“I think it’s pretty funny,” he said. “It’s very strange to have my own television network have my name up on the lower third.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'James Comey, Welcome to the Long List of People Trump Wants to Jail',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "While President Trump can’t unilaterally send someone to prison, he can give someone a Twitter sentencing.James Comey has been subject to the most recent round of lock-him-up taunts from Trump, with the president saying that the former FBI director should be behind bars for allegedly giving up classified information and lying to Congress. In an NPR interview Tuesday morning, Comey responded.“President Trump, I don’t follow him on Twitter, but I get to see his tweets tweeted, I don’t know how many, but some tweets this past couple of days that I should be in jail,” he said. “The president of the United States just said that a private citizen should be jailed. And I think the reaction of most of us was, ‘Meh, that’s another one of those things.’ This is not normal.”But normal is relative, and for Trump, there is nothing particularly unusual about suggesting that a perceived opponent should be jailed. Comey is just the most recent addition to a long list. Standing atop that list is Hillary Clinton, who was a constant source of Trump’s throw-’em-in-jail ire during the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton. In October, Trump tweeted that Clinton “should have been prosecuted and should be in jail” for her alleged sharing of classified emails and concerns over contributions made to the Clinton Foundation. “Instead,” he added, “she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election.”Other Democrats are no stranger to this treatment. The president tweeted that Huma Abedin, Clinton’s longtime aide, “put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents,” and punctuated the tweet with: “Jail!” Trump also said Barack Obama’s car czar Steve Rattner, who was fined $10 million for his alleged involvement for a pay-to-play scheme involving the pension fund of the state of New York, “should have gone to prison.” Other political figures who have received this public condemnation are Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) both of whom Trump claimed, on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, were colluding in the 2016 election. “It’s collusion. In business you go to jail for that, but it’s collusion where they’re coming together because they are getting beaten badly,” he said.Non-political public figures have made cameos on Trump’s Twitter-list of folks to jail. After Snoop Dogg made a mock video of him “executing” Trumpian-looking clown, the president claimed that the rapper would be receiving “Jail time” if he “aimed and fired the gun at President Obama.” Trump said that WikiLeaks leaker Chelsea Manning “should never have been released from prison,” and Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier who deserted his post in 2009 and was held captive by the Haqqani network, would have gotten prison time 10 or 20 years ago.College basketball players also made an appearance on the POTUS’ feed. After a number of UCLA team members were caught shoplifting while in China, Trump tweeted that he “should have left them in jail” because one of the player’s father, LaVar Ball, was “very ungrateful!” for the president’s help in getting them released. Those who express their discontent towards the president also need criminal punishment, according to… the president. Trump suggested that those who burn the American flag should be punished with “perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!” He stated that “thugs” (paid by WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton) who disturbed Trump campaign rallies “should be put in jail.” He also said the protester who tried to rush the stage at his Ohio campaign event “should be in jail” and had “ties to ISIS”—which turned out to be inaccurate.The immigrant population, specifically MS-13 members and illegal immigrants (“We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you and we will deport you”) and people who re-enter the border after being deported (“When they come in another one, it’ll be 10 years”) are in need of jail time too.

  'body': "When Stormy Daniels appeared at Donald Trump’s penthouse hotel room, on the lustful summer night in 2006 that has come to haunt his presidency, the two were not entirely alone. Trump’s loyal bodyguard—a towering former NYPD detective with clipped white hair and a steely expression—met her at the door to the suite, according to Daniels’ account of the alleged tryst. Keith Schiller had already worked for his reality-TV star boss for seven years, ever since a chance encounter with Marla Maples in New York, and he’d quickly risen through the ranks to become Trump’s head of security. Now, he and his boss were in Lake Tahoe for a celebrity golf tournament and, as several women present for the bacchanalian weekend would attest, Trump was looking to get laid.Schiller was apparently ready to help.Earlier that day, Trump—newly married for a third time, with an infant son at home—had visited the curvaceous, blond Daniels at a promo booth for Wicked Pictures, the adult-entertainment studio where Stormy was a “contract girl.” (They’d already shared a flirty ride around the course in a golf cart, Daniels claims.) While there, Trump also ogled another blond bombshell, porn star Jessica Drake. As the women tell it, he scored both of their phone numbers. He singled out Daniels in particular for a dinner date.As night fell, Daniels arrived at Harrah’s Lake Tahoe Hotel and Casino, where Trump was staying. Eighteen floors up, and she found herself face-to-face with the hulking Schiller. “Keith was always with him,” the porn star told In Touch Weekly in 2011, five years after her alleged romp with the future president. “That’s how I got in touch with him. I never had Donald’s cellphone number. I always used Keith’s.”For a man so notoriously loquacious on Twitter, Trump has kept an ironclad grip on the particulars of his personal life. He’s master of the NDA for his Trump Organization employees and former campaign staffers, even trying to ensure White House staff can’t talk. And throughout the years, he’s relied on a small cadre of fixers to help muzzle those who dared blab about his private peccadilloes. One of those loyalists is Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer who was the target of a federal raid, reportedly over his role in paying Stormy Daniels to keep quiet, and possibly for his communications with The National Enquirer, whose owner David Pecker is a strong Trump ally. The magazine’s parent company bought the silence of at least two people with stories that would have been spectacularly damaging to Trump just before the election: Playmate Karen McDougal, who claims she and Trump had a long affair during the same time he was wooing Stormy Daniels; and a Trump World Tower doorman who apparently had intel on rumors about a secret Trump love child. “He’s knee-deep in all of this.”— Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy DanielsThe other main fixture of Trump’s inner circle—one of the few who seems to know all the details about all the women and, like Cohen, is a person of interest to the investigators of the Russia inquiry—is Keith Schiller. Schiller did not return messages left by The Daily Beast, and one of his attorneys declined to comment for this story.“There is no doubt that Keith Schiller knows where all the bodies are buried. Next to Michael Cohen, if Mr. Schiller ever turns state’s evidence, the impact on the president would be catastrophic,” Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, told The Daily Beast.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.While the national focus has been on Cohen, Avenatti says Schiller is a Trump stalwart who’s long been on his radar. “He’s knee-deep in all of this,” Avenatti said. Perhaps no one in Trump’s inner circle, save for Michael Cohen, has the president’s trust more than Schiller. But where Cohen is brash and fiery, Schiller has remained a low-key presence in his boss’ shadow.Politico has called Schiller “Trump’s longest-serving and closest aide—the man who is widely credited with knowing how to manage the president’s moods, his diet, what triggers him and what soothes him.” “There are only two whisperers in Trump world, as far as I’m concerned,” one former aide told Politico last November, adding, “it’s Keith Schiller and Michael Cohen.” As Trump’s hired muscle since 1999, Schiller has allegedly facilitated Trump’s extramarital excursions, socked a protester outside Trump Tower, and delivered former FBI Director James Comey’s termination letter.Schiller skyrocketed from part-time watchman to Trump’s director of security in just under six years. And he followed his boss to Washington as head of Oval Office operations, where he served as gatekeeper, confidant, and fixer for Trump’s McDonald’s cravings. He was an interpreter, too, for frustrated aides.The 59-year-old former detective has been described as Trump’s “loyal lieutenant” and “emotional safety blanket.” Trump reportedly was “crushed” when Schiller departed the White House last September for a private security gig. Even Cohen was worried about how Trump would react in the wake of Schiller’s exit, telling Vanity Fair, “I feel guilty that he’s in there right now almost alone, especially now that Keith has resigned.”“‘There are only two whisperers in Trump world, as far as I’m concerned,’ one former aide told Politico last November, adding, ‘it’s Keith Schiller and Michael Cohen.’”As Schiller has maintained a low profile, Cohen catapulted to the white-hot center of the news after Stormy Daniels filed a lawsuit against him and Trump, to invalidate a “hush agreement” she signed in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. She says the contract is invalid because Trump never signed on the dotted line—and because it violated public policy by suppressing her speech in order to influence the race.Cohen is now facing more legal troubles after the FBI raided his office last week for documents relating to, among other things, his $130,000 payout to Daniels in exchange for her silence about the alleged Trump affair.Trump railed against the search as a “witch hunt,” and floated the possibility of firing Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, after the latter referred the Cohen probe to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.Vanity Fair highlighted Trumpland’s fears of the “brooding” president going rogue and also firing Mueller. Trump was usually calmed by former aides Hope Hicks and Schiller, whose departures have left “Trump to operate largely unchecked.”Last year, ex-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told CNN he’d regularly call Schiller anytime he needed help deciphering The Donald. “Any time I wanted to understand something, I would ask Keith,” Lewandowski said. “I valued him for all the roles he played.”One of those roles, apparently, was acting as liaison to women who caught Trump’s interest.Back to the Tahoe penthouse. July 2006. Stormy Daniels is on the verge of an encounter that will, a decade later, turn her into a household name and attract an astounding 22 million viewers when she spills the dirty details—the spanking, the unprotected sex—on the venerable news program 60 Minutes. And, she says, the person greeting her at the door is Trump’s buzzcutted consigliere Keith Schiller.“Oh yeah, he’s waiting for you inside,” Schiller allegedly told Daniels, before she entered the room and found Trump lounging in pajama pants. After they were intimate, the porn actress says Trump promised, “I’m gonna call you.” “I have to see you again. You’re amazing,” he added.Later that same night, porn star Jessica Drake remembers Trump inviting her, too, up to the Harrah’s penthouse. She was uncomfortable going alone, Drake claimed at a press conference with her attorney Gloria Allred, so she took two other women along. (Those gal pals haven’t yet been identified.) “When we entered the room, [Trump] grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission,” Drake told reporters in October 2016. “He was wearing pajamas,” she continued. “A bodyguard was also present.” The group left after about an hour of idle chit-chat. But when Drake returned to her hotel room, a man called her on Trump’s behalf, according to an account in GQ of Trump’s Tahoe trysts. The man asked Drake if she’d return to Trump’s suite. She declined. Soon, she says, Trump phoned her directly and asked her, “What do you want?” and “How much?” On a third call, he allegedly wooed her with an offer of $10,000 and use of his private jet in exchange for sex. She again declined.Drake has not publicly disclosed whether Schiller was the bodyguard at the penthouse, or whether he was the man who contacted her on Trump’s behalf. Neither Drake nor Allred returned messages seeking comment.“‘Oh yeah, he’s waiting for you inside,’ Schiller allegedly told Daniels, before she entered the room and found Trump lounging in pajama pants.”Yet the next evening, Stormy Daniels got a similar call—from Schiller for sure, she says—asking if she’d join Trump and his fellow celebrity golfers. When she arrived, Schiller was the one to escort her to Trump, who was schmoozing with NFL star Ben Roethlisberger. Months later, Schiller would again greet Daniels at a Hollywood launch party for Trump Vodka and steer her to Trump’s VIP section. And in July 2007, the wingman was tasked with ushering Daniels to Trump’s bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Daniels says Trump blustered about his hatred for sharks before confessing that his efforts to get her on The Apprentice had failed. Then he propositioned her, asking, “So, can you stay?” But she’d lost interest in the mogul; she dismissed Trump’s advances and left. Their meeting lasted for two-and-a-half hours. At the end of it, she says, Keith Schiller politely walked her to her car.Former Playboy model Karen McDougal also mentioned Schiller by name last month in her CNN interview with Anderson Cooper, in which she dished about her alleged affair with Trump. The onetime Playmate of the Year met the reality star in June 2006—just a month before the Tahoe bash—at a party at the Playboy Mansion, where Trump was taping an episode of The Apprentice. Not long after, on a summer night in L.A., she said, Schiller picked McDougal up and drove her to the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow, where she met Trump for dinner. McDougal said she had unprotected intercourse with Trump that night—“We talked for a couple hours – then, it was “ON”! We got naked + had sex,” she later jotted in her notes, according to The New Yorker—and was heartbroken when he tried paying her afterward. “I’m not ‘that girl,’” she told him. She wept in the car as Schiller drove her home.As her affair with Trump persisted, McDougal said she “got to know Keith pretty well.” The 6-foot-4 protector “was always involved” in her communications and visits with the future president. McDougal kept Schiller’s phone number and the digits for Trump’s personal secretary. Both would put her in touch with the real estate mogul.“Keith is a nice man,” McDougal told Cooper. “Yes, I got to know him. He’s funny.”A year later—on a winter eve this time—another woman met Trump at that same Los Angeles bungalow. Their encounter would turn out to be more fraught than the president’s other romps.“As her affair with Trump persisted, McDougal said she ‘got to know Keith pretty well.’”As with McDougal and Daniels, Trump enlisted his “security guard” to bring Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Zervos’ lawsuit doesn’t identify the man by name, and her attorney did not return messages seeking comment on the identity of the bodyguard.When Zervos arrived, she says her TV boss ambushed her. He kissed her “very aggressively” and touched her breast, according to a pending lawsuit. She repeatedly pushed the mogul away, and moved to another part of the room to avoid his advances until he finally relented and ordered dinner—a club sandwich and fries. He reportedly complained about the price.Zervos is now suing Trump for defamation, and says the Beverly Hills encounter was one of several in which Trump kissed her, groped her, and pressed himself against her without her consent. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Zervos came forward as one of more than a dozen women to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct.Trump has adamantly denied all the women’s claims—and those of Daniels and McDougal—both on Twitter and through statements from the White House. After three accusers went on Megyn Kelly Today in December to discuss their experiences with Trump in light of the #MeToo movement, a spokesperson for the president said, “The timing and absurdity of these claims speaks volumes and the publicity tour only confirms the motives behind them.”Meanwhile, this past November, the House intelligence committee grilled Keith Schiller about another group of women rumored to be linked to Trump. This time, though, the setting was not at the shady greens of Lake Tahoe nor in the glittering heart of Beverly Hills, but in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.It was November 2013, and Trump was in Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant. During a meeting at the Ritz-Carlton, where Trump was staying, a Russian participant approached Schiller and offered to send five escorts to Trump’s hotel room, the bodyguard testified. He said he dismissed the proposal as a joke and told the stranger, “We don’t do that type of stuff.” Schiller’s comments were in reference to the so-called Steele dossier, penned by a former British spy, which alleged that Trump had engaged in “perverted sexual acts” with Russian prostitutes and that the Kremlin had tapes of the sexcapades as potential blackmail fodder. Trump and his team have called the Steele dossier’s claims “fake news” and “a total political witch hunt.” Cohen, who is suing several parties involved with the publication of the dossier, called the report “ridiculous on so many levels.” Schiller’s closed-door testimony about the Russian prostitutes—those beauties supposedly at the center of the infamous “pee tape”—came before a House panel investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, NBC News reported. In a contradictory bit of news this week, former FBI Director James Comey claims in his new book that Trump told him he did not spend the night at the Ritz-Carlton, and therefore the pee tape couldn’t be true.But Schiller said he informed Trump of the Russian prostitute proposition as they returned to his hotel room that night. They both laughed at the idea, and Schiller guarded Trump’s door for a bit before heading to his own quarters. Trump went to bed alone, he said.As aide-de-camp, Schiller has learned to anticipate his boss’ wishes. In August 2015, Schiller removed Univision journalist Jorge Ramos from an Iowa press conference. Trump refused to take a question from Ramos, who also wouldn’t back down, prompting Schiller to stride menacingly across the stage and push Ramos out of the room.When asked about the confrontation during a deposition, Schiller said, “I took it upon myself to go and remove him, because it appeared that he was dominating the news conference, not listening or not being cordial or respectful to Mr. Trump…”The deposition was for a lawsuit filed by Efrain Galicia and four other Mexican activists, who claim Trump’s security guards attacked them during a September 2015 protest outside Trump Tower. Schiller had asked the demonstrators to remove an 8-foot-long “Make America Racist Again” poster. When they refused, Schiller ripped the sign away and headed back toward the building, the complaint says.Galicia followed Schiller, whose back was facing him. When Galicia attempted to retrieve the sign, Schiller swung around and clocked him. (Schiller says he believed Galicia was reaching for his concealed weapon, a deposition transcript shows. He said he used a “minimal amount of force to get [Galicia] off of my firearm and off of my body.”)During the December 2016 testimony, Schiller claimed he’d never discussed the Galicia incident with Trump. Schiller said Trump never asked about the encounter, despite being named as a defendant in Galicia’s pending suit.When asked if he always obeyed Trump’s orders to remove disruptive people from events, Schiller replied, “Not always, no.” If someone complied with requests to be quiet, Schiller said he would let them stay.“I’m not a robot,” Schiller said. “It’s been times when it wasn’t appropriate and I didn’t do it.”Schiller has shied away from media interviews. But he did grant a one-hour videotaped conversation to his childhood friend, author Rich Siegel. “I spent a lot of time at bars with him,” Siegel said. “If he thought something was wrong, he was ready to get his fists in there... There was never a fight he strayed away from.”Siegel and Schiller grew up together in New Paltz, New York, before Schiller joined the Navy. He married his wife, Lena, when he returned home.In 1992, he began his NYPD career as a transit cop near Yankee Stadium. In the interview with Siegel, he said he became a narcotics investigator and did cocaine busts in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. Schiller routinely took cases to the Manhattan district attorney’s office. During one visit, he spotted Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, with her personal bodyguard. “I looked at him. Totally not impressed by his stature, physical stature,” Schiller told Siegel in the 2016 video. “I said, if he’s a bodyguard, I sure as f*** is a bodyguard.“I’m no stranger to putting my hands on people,” he added.“I ask the ADA, ‘Do you know Donald Trump?’ He says, ‘Yeah.’ I says, ‘Can you put in a good word? I’m looking for side work,’” Schiller said. Trump’s security boss gave Schiller a one-month trial that blossomed into a 19-year constant companionship. “Every night we were out with different events. Fashion shows. Baseball games. Whatever,” Schiller said.“In the beginning it’s a fascinating job,” he said, adding, “Believe me, so from where I came from, it’s an eye-opener and a great experience.”In 2004, Trump transferred his then-head of security to Las Vegas and needed one of a handful of part-timers to rise in the ranks. “He said, ‘The only guy that I feel that can do this is Keith,’” Schiller said. “I had a great rapport with Mr. Trump and I still enjoy that.”"},
 {'title': 'Ex-CIA Official Says Some Torture Videotapes May Still Exist',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Some videotapes recording the torture of a CIA detainee may have survived the 2005 destruction facilitated by Donald Trump’s nominee to run the agency. That’s according to an ex-CIA analyst who reviewed massive amounts of internal CIA documentation about torture and said she was told by a colleague that some of the tapes survived. The analyst’s assertions are the basis for a new motion filed in federal court by the legal team of tortured terror suspect Abu Zubaydah, whose waterboarding and other brutal interrogation was the subject of most of the 2002-era videos. On Tuesday morning, an attorney for Abu Zubaydah, Joseph Margulies, requested a federal judge to permit the filing of a motion compelling the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to perform a search for the tapes and attest to the results of the search under oath. Should the tapes and related documents still indeed exist, the motion requests their immediate delivery to a court security officer. “For years, the CIA told Petitioner and the rest of the world that it had destroyed the tapes of his torture,” Margulies writes. “We now know that a copy of the tapes likely exists. In this motion, we seek relief to correct this state of affairs.”If any tapes still exist, their existence has implications for Gina Haspel’s potential CIA directorship. In November 2005, Haspel drafted a cable for her boss, clandestine-service chief Jose Rodriguez, ordering the destruction of the videotapes. For years Rodriguez had urged his superiors to destroy the tapes, out of a stated fear that the brutality depicted on them would inevitably leak and place the CIA interrogators, whose faces were supposedly visible on the recordings, in jeopardy. The former CIA analyst does not have first-hand knowledge that the tapes survived. Her account comes from an April 2013 conversation with a CIA colleague who told her that some of Abu Zubaydah’s tapes still existed at the time of their discussion. Her colleague, whom The Daily Beast has not interviewed and whose identity The Daily Beast does not know, denied to investigators for Abu Zubaydah’s legal team any memory of telling the ex-analyst about the tapes. But the now-retired analyst, Gail Helt, said she memorialized their conversation in a notebook she kept at the time, a copy of which The Daily Beast has seen. Haspel’s nomination has compelled her to disclose what she heard, Helt said. “I’m coming forward with this now because I feel very strongly this come to light due to the nomination of Ms. Haspel to run the agency,” said Helt, who has never told this story to the press before.“If she is connected to this [torture] program, and I certainly believe she is, and these tapes exist, it’s in the public interest that we all know what the government has done and could potentially do again. That really concerns me.” Haspel’s nomination hearing before the Senate intelligence committee is scheduled for May 9. Helt understood that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) had received the surviving tapes years ago. But Brian Hale, a spokesperson for the office, denied knowledge of ODNI’s custody of any Abu Zubaydah videotapes, he told The Daily Beast. “Your source is wrong,” said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Additionally, Helt, whose final years with the agency saw her tasked with reviewing internal CIA cables about its former black-site prisoners, said that she saw repeated instances of the agency inflating the threat Abu Zubaydah supposedly posed to the U.S. that were unsupported by the underlying cables. That first-hand account bolsters a central claim of the Senate committee’s 2014 torture report: that the CIA lied about the men in its custody. “I’m coming forward with this now because I feel very strongly this come to light due to the nomination of Ms. Haspel to run the agency.”— Retired CIA analyst Gail HeltThe destruction of the tapes came despite the wishes of George W. Bush’s administration and hesitation from senior CIA attorneys. It was a watershed moment for oversight of post-9/11 torture, leading directly to a Justice Department special prosecutor’s investigation and the Senate intelligence committee’s landmark 2014 torture report. Ironically, destroying tapes of the brutal interrogations of both Abu Zubaydah and Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri led to additional disclosure of CIA torture. Rodriguez, perhaps the CIA alumnus who defends torture most vigorously, was the central figure in the destruction of the tapes. As a self-appointed “chief operations officer” in CTC, who took over the center in May 2002, Rodriguez calls the program “legal, authorized, necessary and safe” in his 2011 memoir Hard Measures. There, he uses the cover name “Jane” to describe a “superstar” woman now known to be Haspel. Rodriguez “had her head one of our earliest ‘black sites,’” he writes, and “later she became my right arm as chief of staff when I led the clandestine service.” Rodriguez assumed that position in November 2004. By then, he had already been pressing for two years to destroy 92 videotapes made at the Thailand black site that displayed the torture of Abu Zubaydah and Nashiri in 2002. The rationales for taping those early interrogations included, Rodriguez later wrote, showing that “if he died it wasn’t our fault.” But since the tapes showed interrogators’ faces, he and others at CIA had “serious safety concerns for the people depicted on the tapes and their families.” But Rodriguez said he received years of “hand-wringing and bureaucratic backpedaling” from CIA attorneys, including John Rizzo. Rizzo’s memoir puts it somewhat differently. Rizzo likens the question of destroying the tapes to “a big turd dumped on my desk.” The two men are consistent in describing senior officials punting on the issue, rather than rejecting the destruction outright. But Rizzo wrote that “destroying the tapes was fraught with enormous risk for the Agency,” since “someone does something like that when he has something to hide.” It wasn’t until June 2004 that a different CIA lawyer informed his White House counterparts that the tapes existed and the agency planned to destroy them. “Their reaction was immediate and unanimous: ‘You plan to do what?’” Rizzo writes. (Rizzo’s memoir refers to 96 videotapes, while every other source, from Rodriguez’s book to a 2004 CIA inspector general’s report, pegs the number at 92 tapes.) Neither Rizzo nor Rodriguez immediately responded to requests for comment.By fall 2005, Rodriguez was beyond “frustrated,” he writes. His “chief of staff,” Haspel, held a meeting with CTC’s attorneys—not Rizzo’s in the CIA Office of General Counsel. To a presumably more receptive group of lawyers, or at least ones who weren’t teetering on the edge of refusal, she asked if destroying the tapes was legal and if Rodriguez had the authority to do it. When she got back a “yes,” Haspel drafted a cable granting permission for the field agents to destroy the tapes that “left nothing to chance. It even told them how to get rid of the tapes,” through use of an industrial shredder. Rodriguez describes himself as doing little more than “hit[ting] Send” on the Haspel-penned cable on Nov. 8, 2005, and learning the next day, Nov. 9, that the deed was done—meaning neither he nor Haspel personally witnessed the destruction of the tapes.The following day, an unnamed CIA official wrote to the agency’s third-in-charge, Executive Director Kyle “Dusty” Foggo, that he or she was “no longer feeling comfortable” about the tape destruction, which may have been “improperly” done. Their communication is partially redacted, after being declassified and released to the ACLU in a transparency lawsuit, but it seems to call Haspel’s honesty into question (PDF). The cable was “apparently drafted by [redacted] and released by Jose,” as theirs were the only two names on it, the official wrote to Foggo in the first of several apparent references to Haspel. Either that unnamed official “lied to Jose” about clearing the cable with an unidentified colleague and the inspector general—which the official said was “my bet”—or “Jose misstated the facts.” The official added that “it is not without relevance” that “[redacted] figured prominently in the tapes, as [redacted] was in charge of [redacted] at the time and clearly would want the tapes destroyed.” Haspel briefly ran the black site where Abu Zubaydah was tortured, though she did so after his torture there occurred. It took until December 2007 for word of the destruction to emerge—thanks not to any CIA declaration, but to a New York Times story.From 2012 to 2014, CIA analyst Helt was assigned to the obscure Office of Detainee Affairs. It was a CIA bureau established to help implement President Barack Obama’s order to empty the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, where Abu Zubaydah and other black-site denizens now reside. Since a portion of the office’s mandate was to aid Guantanamo defense attorneys’ requests for information they could present to the military commissions or their habeas corpus petitions in federal court, Helt and a colleague had access to millions of secret CIA records concerning the torture program. In April 2013, Helt told The Daily Beast, her colleague informed her that some of “the tapes still exist.” The CIA colleague, in Helt’s recollection, archived the surviving tapes and sent them to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for storage at its headquarters complex in northern Virginia, known as Liberty Crossing. Also, Helt said her colleague told her that the CIA had destroyed pages of a diary Abu Zubaydah had kept. Included in the pages was a drawing Abu Zubaydah had made, apparently depicting even more brutal torture methods than those exposed by the Senate report and authorized by the CIA and Bush administration. “He drew something like he was seated in an electric chair,” Helt said she learned from this colleague. “We told DOJ [the Department of Justice] they didn’t exist and they did,” Helt recalled her colleague telling her about the tapes. In advance of Haspel’s confirmation hearing, the CIA recently declassified a 2011 memorandum, penned by then-senior official Michael Morell, that concluded Haspel acted “appropriately” in facilitating the tapes destruction (PDF). Morell considered Haspel to be following Rodriguez’s orders, rather than acting on her own initiative. She acted, “incorrectly, it turns out,” based on a mistaken understanding that Rodriguez would obtain official approval from then-CIA Director Porter Goss for the destruction, Morell found. “Although there is no ‘good soldier’ defense in the case of an act that violates the law or Agency regulations, the Special Prosecutor evidently found no prosecutable offense, nor did I find a violation of Agency regulations,” Morell wrote about Haspel. Ryan Trapani, a CIA spokesman, defended Haspel’s role in the tapes destruction in an earlier conversation with The Daily Beast. “With respect to the videotapes, Haspel has been consistent and clear about her role. She did not appear in the videotapes, nor did she make the decision to destroy them,” Trapani told The Daily Beast.“That decision was made by Rodriguez, who has publicly taken responsibility for his decision. She made sure CIA lawyers were consulted. She made sure the affected officers, whose security was at risk from al Qaeda, were consulted. And she provided the draft cable to Rodriquez with the understanding that he would use the draft cable to raise the issue with Director Goss. When she subsequently saw that Rodriguez had sent the cable to the field, she asked Rodriguez whether he had raised the matter with Goss. Rodriguez told her that he had not talked to Goss and he had sent the cable out based on his understanding of his authority.”"},
 {'title': 'Embattled Chinese Telecom Giant ZTE Hired Trump Campaign Veteran',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A day after President Donald Trump announced he would consider easing penalties against a controversial Chinese electronics company, that company enlisted a Trump campaign veteran to make its case in Washington.ZTE Corporation struck a contract with D.C. lobbying and public relations powerhouse Mercury Public Affairs on May 14, a day after Trump tweeted that he would consider lifting the penalties that had been imposed on the company as punishment for its violation of sanctions against Iran and North Korea.The Mercury consultant working on the account is Bryan Lanza, a veteran of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Less than two weeks after Lanza’s work began, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a tentative deal to ease those penalties, a move criticized by lawmakers of both parties.Many factors likely contributed to the resolution of the ZTE penalties, including efforts to leverage ongoing trade negotiations with China. But the swiftness of the Trump administration’s efforts to reach an agreement with the company—and the equally swift decision of that company to bring on a prominent Trumpworld figure—underscores the new world of influence peddling in Washington D.C. An infamously impulsive president, prone to bucking political norms and changing legislative priorities, has compelled companies to turn to K Street just to keep up. Former aides to any president are a particularly lucrative draw in DC’s influence industry. And true to form, companies looking to win favor with President Trump have frequently turned to those he once employed. Lanza remains close with the White House and occasionally speaks with the president himself.The Trump administration plan is a lifeline for ZTE. The Commerce Department’s decision to ban the use of American-manufactured parts in ZTE products, chiefly smartphones, prompted the company to announce that it would be forced to shut down global operations absent U.S. government relief.ZTE hired Mercury by way of Hogan Lovells, a D.C. law firm that represents the phone company, according to documents filed with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. ZTE, through Hogan Lovells, will pay Mercury $75,000 per month for three months for its services. The company’s DOJ filings say Mercury will “perform government relations and public affairs services, including setting up meetings with U.S. government officials related to U.S. sanctions” on ZTE.Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mercury, declined to go into more detail about its work, only telling The Daily Beast, ”Like any company of its size, [ZTE] faces various challenges and we are helping them from a public affairs perspective to manage those issues.”But ZTE’s challenges are not exactly run-of-the-mill, and its tremendous financial stake in the outcome of a major U.S. government decision is just the sort of situation that requires a foray into Washington’s influence industry—especially one tailor made to an administration that values loyalty and insiderism.“Obviously the Chinese government and ZTE want something from the U.S. government,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center. “One way of getting what they want is hiring well-connected former staffers as lobbyists.”“Foreign entities hiring politically-connected lobbyists who have just come through the revolving door is fairly standard practice,” Fischer added, “but this administration presents all sorts of new opportunities for influence-peddling.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'Mike Pompeo to Huddle With Anti-Semite’s Envoy',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Viktor Orban won reelection as Hungary’s prime minister last month through a blood-and-soil campaign that married anti-Semitism with Islamophobia. Donald Trump’s secretary of state is about to reverse years of U.S. policy and receive Orban’s chief diplomat at Foggy Bottom.Current and former State Department officials expressed alarm that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is giving facetime to an envoy for the demagogic and authoritarian Orban, who also happens to be Vladimir Putin’s best European friend. “I’m fucking disgusted,” said a State Department official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The official considered Pompeo “cozying up to individuals like Orban” part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration ignoring human-rights abuses and democratic backsliding. Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian foreign minister, has been attempting to make direct contact with senior Trump administration officials since Trump’s election, but has gotten pawned off on low-level officials or bundled together at multilateral conferences. The meeting between Pompeo and Szijjarto, scheduled for Wednesday morning, comes as Orban’s ruling Fidesz Party introduced legislation in Budapest on Tuesday threatening nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with jail time for seeming to aid illegal immigrants. That fulfills an election promise: Orban coasted to victory after portraying the billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros, who is Jewish and a Holocaust survivor, as the puppet master behind Muslim migration to Hungary and Europe. The legislation is known as the “Stop Soros” package, and the climate behind it prompted Soros’ Open Society Foundations to leave Hungary entirely. “Szijjarto has made seven trips to D.C. since Trump’s victory. But the most senior official Szijjarto has managed to meet with was the since-fired White House firebrand-without-portfolio Sebastian Gorka.”Szijjarto was no passive participant in the extended demonization of Soros and Muslim refugees. Last year, the Israeli ambassador to Hungary characterized an ad campaign warning that Soros sought “the last laugh” on illegal immigration as invoking “sad memories”—that is, of 20th-century European fascism—and “sow[ing] hatred and fear.” In response, Szijjarto thundered that Soros “would like to settle hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants in Europe and Hungary with the help of the NGOs he finances.” For good measure, Szijjarto contended that the true anti-Semites were “these illegal immigrants,” not his colleagues in Fidesz. Orban and Fidesz won re-election on April 8. Szijjarto, the minister of foreign affairs and trade, escalated his Trump-esque rhetoric soon after. “No matter how many times George Soros goes to Brussels, no matter how many times the issue of illegal immigration is placed on the agenda, and no matter how many allies George Soros has in Brussels, we will not back down. Illegal immigrants will continue to not be allowed entry into Hungary in [the] future,” Szijjarto said on April 18 in a comment featured on the government’s webpage. “Why are George Soros and his people in the European Parliament fighting against certain European countries instead of acting to combat terrorism?”After this report initially published, Heather Nauert, the State Department chief spokesperson, defended the meeting while saying Pompeo categorically rejects anti-Semitism.“Diplomats meet with leaders across the political spectrum.\xa0It doesn’t mean we\xa0see eye to eye on every issue,” Nauert told The Daily Beast. “Hungary is an important\xa0NATO ally.\xa0We deeply value this\xa0partnership, but\xa0just because we are allies doesn’t mean we agree on everything.\xa0We raise our concerns both publicly—including in our most recent human-rights report—and privately when we meet with Hungarian officials. That’s what diplomacy is.”\xa0The 39-year old Szijjarto, who has been foreign minister since 2014, has not been a stranger to Washington. Reportedly, Szijjarto has made seven trips to D.C. since Trump’s victory. But the most senior official Szijjarto has managed to meet with was the since-fired White House firebrand-without-portfolio Sebastian Gorka, who has ties to an extreme-right Hungarian group. Although Szijjarto reportedly got a phone call from Pompeo’s predecessor, Rex Tillerson, the Hungarian minister only got invited to group talks concerning the European Union, NATO, and the war against ISIS. Neither Tillerson nor his Obama administration predecessor, John Kerry, met with him one-on-one.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Antony Blinken, a deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration, said he didn’t have a problem with the Szijjarto meeting in and of itself—diplomats frequently with emissaries from unsavory regimes, though not necessarily at the highest levels—but much depended on the message Pompeo delivers.“If he makes clear our own deep concerns with the trajectory of Hungarian policy, I think that’s a useful thing for the Hungarian foreign minister to hear from a key player in the Trump administration,” Blinken told The Daily Beast. “If, on the other hand, he says nothing about the excesses of Hungary’s policies at home and in Europe, I think it will enforce their own worst instincts.”According to Heather Conley, a senior State Department official for Europe policy in George W. Bush’s administration, no U.S. secretary of state has held a bilateral meeting with their Hungarian counterpart since 2012. That’s an outgrowth of what Conley called an “arm’s length approach” taken by the Obama administration to a NATO ally that began in 2010 to restrict press freedom and judicial independence. During a June 2011 visit to Budapest, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made an unsubtle plea for Orban to reverse his authoritarian course. The bilateral Pompeo-Szijjarto meeting “certainly sends a clear message that there has been a shift in U.S. policy that hasn’t been publicly discussed or explained,” said Conley, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who questioned what the U.S. will get out of the parley. \xa0“I believe in American foreign policy that is values-based, and either you don’t hold this meeting because this ally hasn’t lived up to values you find important, or you hold it to impress on the government how important these values are for you,” Conley added.The State Department hasn’t released an agenda for the Szijjarto meeting. But in a March 2017 interview with the Associated Press, Szijjarto held out hope for a reinvigorated relationship with the U.S. under Trump, who, like Orban, harnessed hatred of immigrants and Muslims. Back then, Szijjarto was urging a position that Trump seems sympathetic toward, even if his administration isn’t: rolling back sanctions on Russia for its occupation of Ukraine. \xa0 “We are pushing for an open, non-emotional, but rational debate and evaluation of the impact of the sanctions,” Szijjarto told the Associated Press back then.Vladimir Putin doesn’t have many friends in European governments. Orban is the most prominent exception. When Putin makes rare visits to European Union member states, he typically chooses Hungary. It’s not hard to see why. Not only was Orban willing to sign gas contracts with Russia after the Ukraine invasion—though Orban has recently reduced his energy reliance on Moscow—but he’s a man whose vision of a post-liberal world order is in harmony with the Russian autocrat’s. His dog-whistle rhetoric about (((Soros))) echoes those of Putin’s mouthpieces. Similarly, in an infamous 2014 address known as the “Illiberal Democracy” speech, Orban sounded Putinesque tones about American decline.“The strength of American soft power is in decline,” Orban declared, “and liberal values today embody corruption, sex and violence, and as such discredit America and American modernization.”“Viktor Orban now appears set to fulfill his campaign pledge to extract ‘moral, political and legal’ retribution... This is the kind of smear campaign that often comes just before the gloves come off and the blows begin.”— Sen. Ben CardinSen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, blasted Orban’s “goulash authoritarianism” on the Senate floor last Thursday, drawing out what he said were disturbing echoes of the Kremlin and warning that the re-empowered Orban government was on the precipice of a dangerous escalation.“Viktor Orban now appears set to fulfill his campaign pledge to extract ‘moral, political and legal’ retribution from those who opposed him. He welcomed the publication of an ‘enemies list’ containing some 200 names—including numerous American citizens—and urged the close-to-Orban media to do more to root them out. This is the kind of smear campaign that often comes just before the gloves come off and the blows begin,” Cardin said. On the eve of Pompeo welcoming Szijjarto to Foggy Bottom, the State Department’s annual religious-freedom report, released Tuesday, noted the ominous climate in Orban’s Hungary. It reported “incidents of assault and hate speech against Muslims and Jews, including Holocaust denial, and vandalism of religious properties”—even as it soft-pedaled Orban’s demonization of Soros.“The government continued its campaign and public messaging against a prominent Jewish Hungarian American business executive,” the State Department report found, “which Jewish leaders said could incite anti-Semitic acts.”"},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Lawyer: We’ll Take Summer Zervos Case All the Way to the Supreme Court',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos’ defamation case against President Trump continues, his attorney says he’s prepared to bring the case to the Supreme Court.During a hearing in Manhattan on Tuesday morning, Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz said he’d argue before the nation’s highest court, if necessary.His comments came during a preliminary conference, in which New York Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter set a roadmap for discovery deadlines.“We have made applications for stays in the appellate division. The Court of Appeals is considering whether or not it has jurisdiction,” Kasowitz said, adding, “This issue will likely reach the Supreme Court of the United States.”Kasowitz declined to comment after the hearing, which Zervos herself did not attend.Trump’s attorneys previously asked Judge Schecter to dismiss the case, arguing that a sitting president is immune from lawsuits in state courts. But Schecter disagreed, and in a March ruling said, “No one is above the law.”“In the end, there is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying civil action related purely to unofficial conduct because defendant is president of the United States,” Schecter noted.Kasowitz has appealed Schecter’s ruling. Last month, a New York appeals court denied Trump’s motion to “pause discovery” in the case while the appeal is pending, paving the way for a gathering of evidence.Zervos’ team issued subpoenas to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns the archives of The Apprentice, and the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Zervos claims the now-president groped her—and where he allegedly met with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.“In the end, there is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying civil action related purely to unofficial conduct because defendant is President of the United States.”Zervos is seeking any documents, video or audio that feature her, or Trump talking about her, as well as recordings of Trump commenting about women “in any sexual or inappropriate manner.”Meanwhile, Zervos also subpoenaed the hotel for records of Trump’s stays from 2005 to 2009, and records relating to Trump’s ex-bodyguard and confidant, Keith Schiller, and his longtime assistant, Rhona Graff. Zervos, a restaurant owner who was fired from Trump’s reality show The Apprentice in 2006, filed her defamation suit in January 2017. After Zervos came forward in 2016, saying Trump groped her, the president accused her of telling “phony stories.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The Apprentice contestant came forward after the release of the Access Hollywood tapes, where Trump made his infamous “grab ‘em by the pussy” comments. “Ms. Zervos was ambushed by Mr. Trump on more than one occasion,” her complaint states. “Mr. Trump suddenly, and without her consent, kissed her on her mouth repeatedly; he touched her breast; and he pressed his genitals up against her. Ms. Zervos never consented to any of this disgusting touching.”Zervo says Trump’s public response to her story caused her emotional and financial distress, and said her restaurant lost customers. In court Tuesday, Zervos’ attorney, Mariann Wang, asked that the case continue without further delays from Team Trump.“We should now after, a year and a half, get moving,” Wang said, adding that Zervos was prepared for an August deposition. (Kasowitz, in court, said he did not plan to proceed with this deposition.)By fighting the case in the state’s appellate division, the state Court of Appeals and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump’s camp “is effectively imposing a stay on this matter,” Wang said. “We would ask for an orderly preliminary conference order that allows us to proceed now.”Wang also broached another potential roadblock in the Zervos case: the request for documents relating to other women.The attorney said she subpoenaed the Trump campaign for any and all documents about other women who have alleged that Trump subjected them to unwanted touching or inappropriate comment. The campaign, Wang said, objected to her request.Schecter asked both sides for a briefing on the matter. Kasowitz said he’ll seek a blanket protective order in the case, similar to what was used in Clinton v. Jones, to keep the identities of witnesses and sensitive information under seal.“We do note the high degree of media interest in the case and our position at this point would be that if such interest intrudes on the rights and interests of the litigants,” it could affect Trump’s right to a fair trial.Kasowitz then told Judge Schecter that his side “will do our best to abide by case deadlines,” but that because of the significant duties of the president, “we reserve the right to make motions to adjourn deadlines.”“And I will deal with those as they come,” Schecter said."},
 {'title': 'Sen. Bob Corker Shreds Trump Administration for Floating More Tariffs',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Republican senators were livid Thursday when they learned that the Trump administration might impose even more tariffs on foreign imports—this time, for automobiles. But none were more irate than Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN).“There’s just no basis whatsoever. And it’s just such a blatant political move. It’s a very dangerous path to go down,” Corker said in an interview. “This whole thing feels like it’s getting out of hand to me. It feels like everything’s becoming transactional.”The Commerce Department, at President Donald Trump’s direction, launched an investigation on Wednesday night into whether automobile imports threaten U.S. national security. Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the executive branch has the authority to impose tariffs on imports it believes could threaten national security. The probe will also focus on “whether the decline of domestic automobile and automotive parts production threatens to weaken the internal economy of the United States,” the department said in a statement.Republicans and conservatives on Capitol Hill have, both privately and publicly, expressed deep concerns with the president’s approach to trade issues and his propensity to impose tariffs. In March, the administration announced new tariffs on steel and aluminum, kicking off intense bilateral negotiations with other countries on potential new trade deals. The Trump administration has leaned on its national-security authority for exploring and eventually implementing tariffs—something Republicans argue is an outdated provision that only threatens to undermine the economic gains already made under Trump’s watch.“It’s an abuse of that authority. It’s very blatant. There’s no rational person that can think that we have a national-security issue with auto manufacturing,” said a visibly frustrated Corker. “It’s a dangerous path. Then other countries can claim tariffs on whatever they deem. They just claim it’s a national security issue. So it’s a very dangerous, inappropriate path to go down.”Corker said he suspects that the decision to open up an investigation had more to do with scoring political points than anything else. He pointed to Trump’s Wednesday morning tweet: “There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!”When asked why he thought the White House publicized the matter, Corker responded, “Hell if I know. It seems like it was for political reasons.”The senator suggested to The Daily Beast that the move was intended to shore up support among union members heading into the midterm elections—particularly, members of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union. Corker, who is not running for re-election this year, is largely credited with bringing a Volkswagen production facility to Chattanooga when he served as the city’s mayor. Like other elected Republicans, he has long been critical of the president’s protectionist views on trade policy, arguing that they undermine the president’s stated “America First” strategy.“Tariffs on the imports of cars and auto parts will not put our workers first by making it more expensive to build and sell cars here,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Corker’s counterpart. “They will destroy the thriving automotive industry that has been built by thousands of skilled Tennessee workers.”Lawmakers have in the past considered legislative action to nullify Trump’s tariffs. But those efforts never went anywhere after GOP lawmakers argued it would be more prudent to help the administration tailor the tariff policy on the front end rather than dismantle it entirely.But this week, Republicans’ posture toward the White House changed dramatically. Just hours after it was reported that the president’s top negotiators had agreed in principle to lift strict penalties on Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE as part of the broader trade talks with Beijing, senators voted overwhelmingly to block the administration from doing just that.“We did cede [trade authority] years ago unfortunately, and probably we should be clawing some of it back,” said Corker.'},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Publisher Pal Puts Saudi Propaganda Magazine in U.S. Supermarkets',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "A nearly 100-page magazine published by Donald Trump’s allies at American Media Inc. is providing a different kind of celebrity gossip than the American supermarket shopper is used to seeing. It’s selling America on a fellow Trump ally, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. MBS, as the millennial victor of last year’s Saudi palace power struggle is known, is currently on an overseas tour to cement his legitimacy. Its current stop is the United States, where MBS met last week with Trump ahead of checking the young-king-in-waiting PR boxes of Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Greeting Americans on newsstands is a high-quality glossy advertisement for MBS, The New Kingdom. It retails for $13.99, has no ads and its 200,000 copies can be found in venues ranging from U.S. airports to WalMart, Safeway and Kroger’s—raising questions about the magazine’s financing and its origins. The Saudis say they don’t know how it came to be. AMI, which publishes The National Enquirer, insists it had no outside editorial or financial assistance, from the Trump administration or otherwise. The New Kingdom doesn’t feature any salacious gossip about MBS, but its coverage is just as breathless. “Our Closest Middle East Ally Destroying Terrorism,” the cover coos, sidestepping decades of Saudi Arabian financial support for terrorist groups and ideologues. It Disneyfies Saudi Arabia as “the Magic Kingdom.” It’s easily the most uncritical encomium to MBS since Thomas Friedman. In terms practically designed to appeal to Trump and his admirers, the cover lines marvel at the 32-year old “next king” who’s “Controlling Staggering $4 Trillion Business Empire” and building a “$640 Billion Sci-Fi City of the Future.” Inside is an ode to his “luxurious lifestyle,” reported $3 billion personal wealth and ownership of a 54,000-square foot palace near Versailles. MBS’ goal for his subjects is described as “spreading happiness.” The centerpiece is a lengthy advertorial for MBS’ “Saudi Vision 2030” initiative — a huge part of which appears to be rebranding the kingdom under MBS. Not since the establishment of Saudi Arabia has the kingdom gone “through such a radical transformation,” whose economic “diversification isn’t just about protecting the rich elite,” the magazine assures. Under MBS, Saudi seeks to become “a global investment powerhouse” and a tech hub. Seven pages go to promoting MBS pet project NEOM, a $640 billion planned “utopian city the likes of which the world has never seen,” ostensibly heavy on networked devices, with a cooler temperature than the rest of Saudi Arabia – literally and metaphorically. With the exception of a ban on alcohol, NOEM, the article insists, will have “a more benign attitude toward what is acceptable and what is not in terms of dress and behavior.” All this includes emphasizing, as MBS often does, “New Rights for Saudi Women,” such as the ability to drive and attend coed Yanni performances. Behind the heavily promoted gender liberalization program is “of course: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.” Unmentioned in The New Kingdom is Saudi Arabia’s system of male guardianship, a literal patriarchal tool that requires male relatives to provide women “permission,” Human Rights Watch pointed out, for everything from obtaining an apartment, filing legal claims, obtaining a passport, being released from prison and, in some cases, “to work or access healthcare.” (Or, as The New Kingdom puts it, women “have traditionally taken a back seat to men.”) Other things not mentioned in the magazine: Saudi Arabia’s massive number of executions, which are conducted by stoning and even Islamic State-like public beheadings. You can see a gorgeous pictorial spread of desert-striding oryx and an adorable hamadryas baboon (“With national protection, many of the land’s majestic, formerly troubled species are thriving once again,” we learn) but read nothing about the three-year-old war Saudi Arabia is conducting in Yemen, under Defense Minister MBS, that has led the United Nations to warn of a widespread famine. The typically unbylined articles refer to MBS’ “sweeping crackdown on corruption resulting in the arrest of some of the country’s most powerful figures” but neglect the part where they had to sign over shares in their companies, their properties and even cash to get out of their gilded hotel-prison. (Even as an article boasts that MBS is “said to control almost all of the kingdom’s wealth.”) But if the magazine sidles past the less comfortable aspects of Saudi Arabia’s counterterrorism and human rights records, it is firmly comfortable exalting the partnership between MBS and Donald Trump. There are five pictures of Trump – including one of MBS shaking the president’s hand, placed adjacent to one of a beaming MBS greeting Vladimir Putin. Only cover boy MBS, with eleven, has more photos. Here is Trump triumphant in his May visit to Riyadh. Here is Trump, flanked by wife Melania and octogenarian King Salman. Here is Trump in that orb photo. MBS is quoted describing Trump as “a president who will bring America back on the right track.” “There are five pictures of Trump . Only cover boy MBS, with eleven, has more photos.”For good measure, MBS also appears photographed beside Bill Gates, Xi Jinping, Shinzo Abe and a giggly U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He’s a world leader “poised to spread modernism throughout his kingdom,” the copy reads. An article with no byline hails his “ambitious and unprecedented plan to bring economic, social and religious change to the traditionally conservative country.” It treats MBS’ ascendance to the throne – something secured through what the Guardian called a “slow-motion coup” – as a fait accompli, writing that “senior sources in Saudi [are] expecting him to assume the throne within the year.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“We will not continue to be in the post-’79 era – that age is over,” MBS promises on the inside cover. That quote, functionally an epigram for the magazine, is an ambiguous reference to two seismic regional developments in 1979.In November of 1979, Islamist militants seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, an act that challenged the legitimacy of the House of Saud. With French and Pakistani aid, the ruling family recovered the mosque and then accommodated Wahhabist fundamentalism at home and exported it abroad – most immediately, in support of the insurgency against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The second critical development in 1979 is the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia’s principal enemy and, alongside oil, the adhesive of the U.S.-Saudi alliance for the last four decades. The impression left with a reader is that MBS is unwilling to tolerate either. The New Kingdom cites an interview with the Guardian, conducted by its aggressive Mideast correspondent Martin Chulov, where MBS pledges: “What happened in the last 30 years is not Saudi Arabia. What happened in the region in the last 30 years is not the Middle East. After the Iranian revolution in 1979, people wanted to copy this model in different countries, one of them is Saudi Arabia. We didn’t know how to deal with it. And the problem spread all over the world. Now is the time to get rid of it.”Most of the articles are unbylined. The exception is a piece attributed to Kacy Grine, a financial adviser to one of the world’s richest men, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, whom MBS imprisoned in the Ritz-Carlton for 83 days. Accompanying it is a photo of Grine standing to the right of a beaming President Trump inside the Oval Office. Grine wants you to think of Saudi Arabia not as Diet ISIS, but as a capitalist powerhouse for the 21st century.Grine encourages you to think of Saudi Arabia “by picturing a start-up.” In a short, buzzword-filled article with the flavor of an investor prospectus, Grine pitches a Saudi-centered “United Arabic Market,” phasing out a reliance on oil exports (“data is the new oil” “Now it’s time for a new deal – with content providers and based on data”) and essentially expanding the House of Saud’s holdings into economic sway over a billion Arabs. And not just them. Grine explicitly urges Saudi Arabia to “acquire strategic stakes in U.S. tech, media, sports and entertainment companies.”A common market is usually the sort of thing that disgusts Trump’s nationalist base, but Grine doesn’t reckon with that. “The new Saudi-led United Arabic Market could be positioned between China and Europe,” he enthuses instead, “offering an open market (Europe-like) with monopolistic positions through a robust architecture without a constraining antitrust regulation (China-like).” With similar euphemism, Grine assures readers that Saudi Arabia isn’t hung up on the whole Israel thing. Seven decades of “missed opportunities” for “the Palestinian cause” can be mitigated by a unified market that “could build economic relations with Israel and form a new Palestinian generation willing to create a brighter and more sustainable future for Palestine.” Left unaddressed is the central question of Palestinian political independence from under Israeli occupation, a question whose urgency is compounded now that at least one Israeli Army survey has found more Arabs than Jews live in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. That elision mirrors the one widely expected to feature in the as-yet-unveiled “peace plan” authored by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and the American version of MBS. The magazine features no advertisements and comes with a hefty cover price, with a display notice lasting until early June, long after MBS’ American visit ends in April. The Saudis denied playing any role in financing the publication, and view it as something of a surprise. “Neither the Embassy nor any other part of the Saudi Government commissioned this, and we don't know who did,” said Embassy spokeswoman Fatimah Baeshen.A State Department spokesperson was “unaware of any involvement on State’s part” in the production of the magazine and referred The Daily Beast to the White House, which did not respond to repeated inquiries. Neither did the Trump Organization. \xa0AMI, for its part, insisted it had no outside help for the publication. A spokesperson compared its decision to publish the fawning magazine to special issues it devoted to “The Royals, Elvis, The Kennedys, The Olympics, etc,” all of which are vastly better known to American audiences than a 32-year-old Saudi royal. “Publishing this Special Interest Publication was a business decision made by AMI. AMI timed this special issue to coincide and capitalize on the news coverage surrounding the Crown Prince's arrival and reports that he would meet with President Trump and visit U.S. Executives,” a statement provided to The Daily Beast read, even though MBS’ U.S. tour has hardly generated blanket coverage, with the notable exception of a 60 Minutes interview. Plus, the magazine isn’t just about MBS. Substantial chunks of it is about Saudi Arabia itself – its history, its topography, its horse racing and falcon breeding, its cities, and its cuisine.“No one, outside of American Media Inc., its business executives and its editorial staff, had any influence on this publication or its content,” an AMI spokesperson told The Daily Beast.

 {'title': 'Steve Bannon Got Russian ‘Evidence’ From Rob Goldstone During Transition',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Russian efforts to influence President Donald Trump didn’t end with the campaign. Newly released emails show the man who set up the Trump Tower meeting also sent a letter aimed at undermining U.S. sanctions against Russia during the transition to Trump’s personal assistant, who shared those materials with Steve Bannon. Rob Goldstone is a British music agent who represented Emin Agalarov, son of billionaire construction magnate Aras Agalarov. Goldstone in June 2016, acting on behalf of the Agalarovs, contacted Donald Trump Jr. about meeting a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower for “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. On Nov. 28, 2016, Goldstone emailed Trump’s assistant, Rhona Graff, with a proposal. Subject line: “For Mr. Trump.”“Aras Agalarov has asked me to pass on this document in the hope it can be passed on to the appropriate team,” Goldstone wrote in an email released Wednesday morning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. “If needed, a lawyer representing the case is in New York currently and happy to meet with any member of the transition team.”The case was against Prevezon Holdings, a Russian company charged with money laundering. And the document Goldstone passed along made the case for overturning the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions some Russians for human-rights violations. “Russia has evidence that the story underlying the act is a lie from beginning to end,” reads the document Goldstone sent Graff. The document went on to argue that the Magnitsky Act sanctions were part of a plot to undermine Russian economic interests, and that Bill Browder, who was Sergei Magnitsky’s boss before he died in a Russian prison, was a bad actor working for his own financial gain. The letter also suggested U.S.-Russia relations were set to improve under Trump. “Today, all the conditions required for improvement of relations between Russia and the US, which many of the interested persons have long sought to prevent for some personal reasons, are in place,” the document said. Graff forwarded the email and document to Steve Bannon, who was working on the transition at the time. “The PE [president elect] knows Aras well,” Graff wrote to Bannon. “Rob is his rep in the US and sent this on. Not sure how to proceed, if at all.”Bannon’s lawyer declined to comment for this story.Goldstone was a tabloid journalist before he started represented musicians, including John Denver and Michael Jackson. In New York, he’s known as a playboy with a penchant for vodka-soaked parties at the Russian Tea Room and documenting his flamboyant lifestyle on social media. '},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump spent his long Memorial Day weekend sequestered mostly in the White House. But instead of holiday tweeting about the “haters and losers”—of which, he once said, “sadly, there are many”—he opted to lob innuendo and unfounded accusations at the man who occupied the office before him.Barack Obama, Trump declared over the course of several days, “did NOTHING” on trade, let the sanctioned Chinese phone company ZTE “flourish with no security checks,” employed various lawyers on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, ignored Russian election meddling, and, above all, authorized “spying” on the Trump 2016 campaign.Broadsides against his predecessor are nothing new for Trump. Nor are the false and misleading suggestions that President Obama snooped on him during his campaign. In early 2017, Trump very publicly, and erroneously, accused Obama of wiretapping him in 2016.What stood out about the weekend’s salvo was the vitriol, perhaps panic, behind it and the frostiness it underscored about the relationship between the two most recent Oval Office occupants. According to two White House officials, Trump has been privately wondering whether Obama is actively working behind the scenes to undermine or undercut his presidency. And he’s done so without bothering to pick up the phone to ask or confront his predecessor. Obama and Trump have not spoken since the inauguration. There was an attempt. Following Trump’s inauguration, the new president tried to call Obama. But according to The Wall Street Journal, the two never connected. Matters weren’t helped when, in early 2017, Obama became furious about Trump’s groundless allegation that the former had wiretapped the latter in 2016.There has been no communication since. When asked if Jan. 20, 2017, was the last time the two spoke, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The Daily Beast, “as far as I know.”The cold front has extended beyond the presidential level. According to one former senior Obama administration official, no one in the Trump White House has contacted top members of Obama’s national-security team to either inquire about or discuss the spying accusations. “To my knowledge,” the senior official said, “none of those people are in contact with each other at a substantive level.”Several of those members, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan, have been blistering in their criticism of Trump and, as a result, the routine subject of Team Trump’s missives. The result has been a vicious and petty war of words that would have been utterly discordant for any presidency prior. “I think they are all at the point where they are offended by the attacks on the rule of law,” the senior official said of Clapper, Brennan, and the like. “Roger Stone told John Brennan he should take a cyanide pill. Once you get to that point it is hard to be offended. But they are deeply worried about the harm it is doing to our democracy.” The most senior members of successive administrations usually adopt a muted approach to one another out of a sense of professional courtesy. That is particularly true at the presidential level, where there is a particular interest in demonstrating a continuity to the office. Obama has largely done his part, weighing in sporadically on the Trump presidency and almost exclusively during those occasions when his major policy achievements are being rolled back or unraveled.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Trump has declined to abide by such norms. In private conversation, he has repeatedly brought up Obama’s supposed “spying” right before his shock election victory, with one close confidant characterizing it as more often “musing than definitive” statement or a firm conviction that he’s uncovered the crime of the century. And yet, those musings often spill over into public, with the current president often comparing the last one to Richard Nixon based on conspiracy theories or right-wing memes.On May 17, Trump posted online that, “word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI ‘SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.’” On May 20, Trump demanded, via Twitter, “that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” The following day, he quoted The Wall Street Journal, in asking, “‘WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?’”For former Obama aides, it’s been a shock to the system—at times confusing in its complete removal from reality and, simultaneously, terrifying for the larger implications. “To hear president of the United States even surmise that a previous administration was spying against him for political purposes, it suggests to me he doesn't appreciate those stringent controls that are in place,” said Ned Price, President Obama’s national-security spokesman. “This is either all pure show and theater and he knows as much or there is an idea in his head that this is possible and could have happened. What is really scary is that if he thinks it is possible that this happened, is he giving similar orders to his people?” "},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "PARIS — On Monday evening, the French watched reports of President Emmanuel Macron’s state visit to Washington as if spectators at the Comédie Française, unsure whether the elaborately choreographed new play would veer toward tragedy or farce. As the first ladies in spike heels teetered on the lawn during a White House tree planting, and the burly, clownish President Donald Trump received the slight, elegant Macron with kisses, the spectacle both amazed and amused. The big unanswerable question is how it will end––but since the beginning this “bromance” (a term Macron aides keep trying to shoot down) has been a curious drama. Last summer the world watched with curiosity and surprise as French President Emmanuel Macron rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump and welcomed him to the country’s annual Bastille Day celebrations. After all, this was the same man who had seized Trump’s hand in a vice-grip greeting felt around the world at the NATO summit in Brussels, and went so far as to troll his American counterpart following the former’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord by launching an initiative to lure U.S.-based climate scientists to France. “To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second homeland,” an earnest Macron said in the video, addressing viewers in English. He even went so far as to name the initiative “Make our Planet Great Again,” an audacious riff on Trump’s own campaign slogan. As for Trump, not only did he blatantly support Macron’s far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, during the French election campaign a year ago, but he also made unflattering comments about the French capital, suggesting that it was overrun with jihadists and was no longer worth visiting. “Paris in no longer Paris,” Trump announced at last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference—a comment that would come back to bite him during a press conference during last July's visit.Even Trump’s arrival in the French capital began on a highly awkward note in the form of creepy, inappropriate comments about the figure of French first lady Brigitte Macron, who is in her sixties.“You’re in such good shape,” Trump said before turning to Macron. “She is in such good shape. Beautiful.”But then the unthinkable happened: Macron’s Bastille Day charm offensive worked wonders and an unlikely political bromance was born. “You know what? It’s going to be just fine, because you have a great president,” Trump told reporters in response to questions about his earlier comments about the city. “You have somebody that’s going to run this country right.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.So impressed was Trump by the young French president’s welcome, that he even hinted he might reconsider his stance on the Paris climate agreement. He then set off for dinner with Macron on the Eiffel Tower—a location choice that was almost comical given Trump’s earlier anti-Paris comments. Despite his bluster, Trump was literally dining inside the most iconic of French monuments—a symbolic and personal victory for Macron, who had succeeded where other European leaders had failed dismally. In flattering Trump, he had shored up ties with an essential ally and bolstered the position of France on the world stage. Trump may still be, to put it mildly, widely disliked by the French, but Macron has chosen to look beyond the American president’s often outrageous antics for the sake of his own agenda. Indeed, in a televised interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr in January, Macron carefully emphasized their “good relationship,” \xa0despite pointed questions over Trump’s personality and baffling tweets. “Look, I think he is not a typical politician,” Macron said evenly when asked about his impression of Trump. “He was elected by the American people as the president of the United States, and that is a great country and that is a great ally. So I want to work with him and I want to build a very strong relationship.”“We disagree on several topics,” Macron continued, adding that he called Trump regularly. “I am always very direct and frank. Sometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail.”The fledgling president’s position as what some analysts have dubbed the “Trump whisperer,” appears to have paid off, at least in the short run. In a first since the days of Calvin Coolidge, Trump passed his first year in office without inviting a foreign counterpart for a state visit. However, when he did, he chose Macron. The question remains whether Macron will succeed or fail to convince Trump to change his positions on trade tariffs or, critically, the Iran nuclear deal. On such issues, Trump tends to return to rhetoric and positions that please his core supporters, not his foreign counterparts.Following their dinner last night at George Washington’s historic Mount Vernon mansion, the two leaders plan to get down to business Tuesday before holding a joint press conference. Once again, the world’s eyes will be on Macron as much as Trump.A failure to find common ground could damage Macron’s reputation back home, where he is currently under pressure from striking rail workers and disgruntled students. Moreover, because Trump remains so reviled in France, getting too close to him could further erode Macron’s waning popularity. Trump has a way of betraying friends and allies if he thinks they might be disloyal to him, and a betrayal of Macron would hurt one of the last best advocates for centrism in the face of ferocious populist polarization across Europe and around the world.“What is reasonable is real; that which is real is reasonable,” said the German philosopher Hegel, who fascinated the French leader during his university days. For anyone who has followed his bombastic late-night Twitter tirades, reasonability is not Trump's forte. Whether the friendship between the two men will move beyond symbolic gestures, and, more importantly, whether Macron can indeed act as a voice of reason for America’s impetuous leader remains to be seen."},
 {'title': 'Disgraced Ex-Jack Abramoff Associate Inches Back Into National Politics',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'A former business partner of infamous lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who previously pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy, has quietly re-emerged on the national political scene.Adam Kidan, who currently serves as the chairman and CEO of Chartwell Staffing Solutions according to his website, donated $30,800, according to FEC records, to seven Republican House candidates in 2017 including Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA) and Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY). Prior to these contributions, the last federal contributions Kidan made were in the 2001-2002 cycle. The gap in giving can be explained, in part, by the fact that Kidan went to jail. In 2005, Kidan pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy, stemming from a 2000 incident in which he and Abramoff allegedly devised a fake wire transfer to purchase gambling boats (a different scandal from another Abramoff-related one, in which he defrauded Native American tribes). A year later, Konstantinos "Gus" Boulis, who owned the SunCruz casino boat company, was killed in Fort Lauderdale. Three men were charged with killing him, two of which were reportedly hired as consultants by Kidan. Attorneys for Abramoff and Kidan said that they had no knowledge about the people who killed Boulis. At the time, Abramoff was a powerful Washington lobbyist who was leveraging relationships with people in the offices of Reps. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and Robert Ney (R-OH) to facilitate the deal for SunCruz, The Washington Post reported in 2005. Kidan was his business associate. Abramoff was sentenced to six years in prison and went on to serve 43 months. Kidan served 31 months in prison and was later apologetic for the role he had played. "I wish I had never met Jack," he said of Abramoff, who had been his college friend.”I played with the big boys and this is the result.”Kidan did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast via his website. \xa0'},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Washington D.C. Hotel Is Hosting Yet Another Foreign Government',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'The Philippine government is hosting an event in the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. this coming June amid ongoing concern that the property is being used as a conduit to gain influence with the president. The event is being billed as “a Reception to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the proclamation of Philippine Independence” and is being hosted, formally, by “The Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines.” A copy of the invitation was obtained by The Daily Beast. A spokesperson for the Philippine embassy confirmed the details of the invitation.The event comes as the Philippines seeks a new trade deal with the United States, an agreement that Trump has pledged to consider but on which he has yet to finalize a decision.While running for office, then-candidate Donald Trump said he would cordone himself off from his private business matters in order to avoid potential conflicts of interests. But after his election, he put his assets in a trust that he could access at any time and handed over control of his company to his children. In order to keep up the veneer of propriety, the Trump Organization said that it would regularly write the Treasury Department a check for the amount of profits its hotels generate from the business done there by foreign officials. It did so in February, with a check totalling $151,470.But even if the Trump Organization is merely breaking even on deals with foreign governments, good government groups warn that the arrangement raises ethical red flags. In particular, organizations with any business before the U.S. government will feel compelled to use the Trump International while in D.C., lest they draw the ire of the president. Some foreign governments have indeed spent lavishly at Trump properties while pursuing discrete U.S. policy goals. The government of Saudi Arabia, for instance, dropped about $270,000 at Trump’s Washington hotel in late 2016 and early 2017, as it sought to roll back a law that would allow victims of terrorist attacks to sue state sponsors of terrorism.Manila already has close relations with the Trump family. The Filipino trade envoy is developing the Trump Tower Manila. Trump, meanwhile, has been one of the few vocal supporters of the country’s president Rodrigo Duterte, praising the strongman for his policy of murdering drug dealers and even inviting him to visit the White House last spring. The completion of a trade deal would further solidify those ties. Duterte, who has yet to come to Washington D.C., brought up the topic in a conversation with Trump late last year. “The United States welcomed the Philippines’ interest in a bilateral free trade agreement and both sides agreed to discuss the matter further,” the White House said in a November statement.'},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Turbulent Tariff Policy Has Been Nirvana for K Street',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'This past winter, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned chemical company needed help fending off the possibility of new sanctions from the Trump administration on their solar industry. So they did what any smart company would do: They hired the firm reportedly comprised of D.C.’s best-connected lobbyists. The company, REC Americas LLC, is a subsidiary of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of ChemChina, the Chinese pesticide behemoth that made a whopping $45 billion in revenue in 2015, per The Wall Street Journal. And the firm is Ballard Partners, helmed by two Trump World insiders: Brian Ballard, a key member of Trump’s 2016 fundraising team, and Susie Wiles. In the first three months of 2018, according to disclosures forms, REC Americas LLC dolled out $50,000 to Ballard Partners to lobby the White House and the office of the U.S. Trade Representatives over solar panel policy and trade tariffs. And that wasn’t the only company turning to the firm for help on that specific matter. In the preceding months, Ballard signed two other solar clients to help on trade policy issues and the Trump administration trade actions in particular. Utah-based Vivint Solar and San Francisco’s Sunrun both inked deals with Ballard on Nov. 15, 2017, a day after the U.S. International Trade Commission unveiled recommendations for solar tariffs.The boomlet for Ballard, which didn’t respond to questions about its work, represents a growing trend in the influence-peddling industry. Across the board, some of the world’s largest companies and trade associations are scrambling to comply with, be exempted from, or otherwise help shape the Trump administration’s ad hoc tariff policies on various foreign imports.The result has been an explosion in the amounts of money spent to influence the U.S. government—including Congress, the White House, and various federal agencies—on trade policy issues. A Daily Beast analysis of lobbying disclosure records indicates that money spent to influence trade policy skyrocketed from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018, when the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels, and various Chinese goods.In 2017, all federal lobbyists that reported working on “tariffs” brought in a total of $10.2 million per quarter, on average. In the first quarter of 2018, they were collectively paid more than $90 million. Those that reported working on a singular “tariff” reported bringing in $70.3 million in Q1 2018, compared to a quarterly average of just $32.6 million in 2017.Chinese firms are far from the only ones looking to shape U.S. trade policy. The top lobbying clients engaging on the issue this year include some of the largest U.S. companies and trade associations, including tech companies Amazon and Google, oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil, and the leading American business lobby, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The massive increase in lobbying expenditures reflects an odd side effect of Trump’s impetuous governing style. A man who pledged to drain the swamp is dramatically contributing to it by having little in the way of straightforward policy strategy. Instead of a singular announcement of a new tariff policy, the administration has teased it out for weeks. Instead of a declared objective, they’ve offered several. By imposing blanket U.S. import restrictions and then exempting certain countries on an ad hoc basis, the Trump administration has dramatically increased financial incentives to try to sway U.S. policymakers on specific trade questions.Just this week, the administration announced that it would delay the implementation of steel and aluminum tariffs on goods imported from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. But those U.S. trading partners said the delay hardly granted a reprieve, and instead simply fueled policy uncertainty for companies shipping billions of dollars worth of goods to American markets.For companies operating in that political limbo, the ability to sway U.S. policymakers—or at least be apprised of their thinking—isn’t just valuable, it’s essential. That’s the sort of expertise that politically connected K Street firms, especially ones close to administration power brokers, offer at considerable rates.'},
 {'title': 'Trump’s Latest FBI Attack Stuns Justice Dept. Officials: ‘We’re in Venezuela’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'President Donald Trump’s latest round of attacks on the FBI has left morale at the Justice Department at a new low, with officials bemoaning what they view as a full-frontal assault on their institution. “It’s a deliberate campaign to delegitimize institutions where the people who are inside those institutions are professionals and giving up lots of money for the jobs that they’re doing and it’s extremely demoralizing,” said one current federal prosecutor. “As my father used to say, history goes forward and backward. And things go backward when the trust in bedrock institutions—which are trustworthy, by the way—is diminished for the benefit of a few. It accelerates, and you wake up one day and we’re in Venezuela.”Trump has been pushing a conspiracy theory that the FBI sicced a spy on his campaign during the election season. In reality, a longtime FBI informant—per numerous reports—spoke with several Trump campaign officials, including Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, and shared the information with FBI investigators. The Daily Caller reported the name of the person believed to be that informant. Using informants is typical for federal law enforcement, including in large and complex cases like the one involving Team Trump. But the president took to Twitter to assert that something more nefarious may have happened. “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” he tweeted on Sunday. After the president’s tweet, a spokesperson for the Justice Department announced that the department’s inspector general would expand an existing probe to look into “whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election.”On Monday afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—who is overseeing the Russia probe—met with Trump, along with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Chris Wray. The attacks have left many in the DOJ feeling beleaguered and demoralized. “Where I sit, people mostly suffer in silence,” one federal prosecutor told The Daily Beast. He pointed to a piece in the blog Lawfare by Ben Wittes and Quinta Jurecic as capturing “a feeling that’s broadly held” in the department. Wittes and Jurecic wrote that the revelation of the identity of the alleged informant “will have a long tail and big consequences—all of them terrible.”“You can’t overstate how critical it is for us—and in particular for the FBI—that people who have information to share will trust us to protect them,” the prosecutor continued. “My personal view is that Trump and [House Intel Chair Devin] Nunes must know that their actions will give pause to anyone considering cooperation with the special counsel, and that’s part of their plan—the consequences for law enforcement writ large be damned.”Another DOJ official told The Daily Beast that morale at the FBI has hit rock bottom. That official said he hears a constant refrain, over and over, among his colleagues: “This is such a dark time for the FBI.” '},
 {'title': 'How Jay Sekulow Keeps Surviving Trump’s Legal Team Purges',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "When it comes to tumult, President Donald Trump’s legal team has known its fair share. Less than a year ago, New York attorney Marc Kasowitz was helming the team—and making headlines for telling a stranger who emailed him about Rachel Maddow’s show to “Watch your back, bitch.” He departed July 21, 2017. In the months since then, lawyers have come and gone. John Dowd, a veteran white-collar defense attorney, came aboard as lead lawyer for the president on June 16, 2017, and departed on March 22 of this year. Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer tasked with overseeing document production and interviews for special counsel Robert Mueller, is set to leave later this month. And husband-and-wife pair Victoria Toensing and Joseph DiGenova were on the cusp of joining the president’s legal team until, well, they weren’t. But through all that, one person has remained a consistent presence: Jay Sekulow, a lawyer best known for championing social-conservative causes at the Supreme Court. “His constitutional prowess, the confidence the president has in him, his steadiness, his lack of volatility, his ability to think strategically and communicate those strategies to the president are the reasons he’s been such an essential member of the team,” Cobb told The Daily Beast. Sekulow gets the most attention for his media appearances; he’s a mainstay on Fox News, where he defends the president and lambasts his critics. He also hosts a daily radio show, which he spends several hours preparing for. Sekulow doesn’t have experience with white-collar criminal law, and is viewed in some corners as a television figurehead. Conservative movement leaders who know him speculated to The Daily Beast that his role on the president’s legal team must be primarily cosmetic.But people familiar with the president’s legal team said Sekulow has played a substantial role in its actual inner workings. One source familiar with the matter said Sekulow has played an essential role in efforts to negotiate an interview between Mueller and Trump. “There’s never been a discussion about an interview that didn’t include Jay,” the source said. Sekulow told The Daily Beast that the president’s legal team is still working to determine its final advice for Trump on sitting for an interview with Mueller. “There’s a full legal team in place now that’s doing a full evaluation of the case, and we’ll make a recommendation to the president,” he said. John Dowd, formerly on the president’s outside legal team, told The Daily Beast that Mueller and his team raised 16 issues they wanted to talk about with the president, and that Sekulow and the lawyers working under him played a central role in writing up a response to those queries. “They raised 16 issues with us they wanted to talk to the president about, and we addressed it in writing, wrote them back,” Dowd said, “And we also laid out why they were not entitled to talk to the president: Article 2, Espy, on and on.” Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.He said the work Sekulow and his team did writing was exemplary. “We liked each other, we communicated, we stayed on the same page,” Dowd said. “It was terrific. I think we did an outstanding job for the president. I don’t think you can improve on what we’ve already done.”“He’s just solid,” Dowd added of Sekulow. “He’s a good man. It was an absolute pleasure to work with him.”Sekulow and the lawyers working under him have done research and written internal memos. They’ve also focused on the constitutional issues that may arise from the Mueller probe, particularly looking at what would happen if Mueller were to try to subpoena Trump. “There are significant constitutional issues arising in this matter that deserve a lot of attention,” Sekulow said. Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani, a new addition to the president’s outside legal team, have known each other for three decades and worked together on a host of issues, including advocating for the release of Andrew Brunson, a Christian pastor jailed in Turkey.“I just received a call from the vice president’s office,” Sekulow wrote at his organization’s website in May of last year. “President Trump and Vice President Pence raised the case of American Pastor Andrew Brunson three times today with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.” The following month, it would be announced that Sekulow was joining President Trump’s legal team.Trump has tweeted about Brunson’s plight and called for his release. Beyond his years-long work with Trump on these issues, Sekulow also endeared himself to the president with his cable-news hits, where in the past year—even before joining Trump’s legal team—he has passionately defended the president. In conversations with associates and aides, Trump has positively commented on, or casually reviewed, specific clips he has caught on TV of Sekulow going after alleged corruption at the Department of Justice and FBI. President Trump has often commented on how “sharp” he looks and sounds on live television, and has previously referred to him as one of his cable-news-ready “warriors,” according to a former White House official and another person close to Trump. The president frequently uses the term “warrior” for his favorite on-air defenders.Dating back to at least the summer of 2011—around the same time Trump began his political ascendancy on the right as a leading figure in the racist anti-Obama birther movement—Trump began promoting and appearing on the nationally syndicated radio show Jay Sekulow Live, and taking up some of their causes on Twitter.“Why didn’t Obama, as part of the negotiation [with Iran], free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini?” Trump tweeted in November 2013. (The pastor was released in January 2016.) In his tweet, Trump linked to an ACLJ post written by Jordan Sekulow, Jay’s son, denouncing President Barack Obama for leaving “Pastor Saeed behind in the vain hope that we can trust Iran.”The following month, Trump tweeted another ACLJ post titled, “Pastor Saeed’s Wife Expresses Gratitude to Donald Trump for Raising Her Husband’s Plight.” Years later, the pastor would say that he had a vision while in solitary confinement in Iran that Trump would become president and that they would be friends."},

His work at the FBI was recognized through the awards he received: NCIX Counterintelligence Award of Excellence, a NCIX Community Award for Counterintelligence and an ODNI Exceptional Achievement Medal. While the specifics of the awards are still classified I know the details of his ODNI Exceptional Achievement Medal intimately, since it deals with my three years working for Scott and the FBI as a double agent against Russian military intelligence.The last time I saw Scott was in 2009, when he attended my swearing-in as I received my commission to become an officer in the United States Navy, but we have stayed in touch over the years. With my book, How to Catch a Russian Spy, published, and Scott now retired from the FBI, we were both free to talk about old times—and the role of Russian intelligence in the 2016 elections. While I don’t \xa0always share Scott’s views—lightly edited in the exchange below for space and clarity—they offer a window into how the present moment, and particularly the Russia investigation, looks to a longtime Bureau line agent and then supervisor. Naveed Jamali: The British have been adamant that Russia was behind the assassination of Sergei Skripal. If that’s so, what was Russia seeking to accomplish?Scott Olson: Not that Russia’s practice of murdering its own expatriates is anything other than an offense against humanity, but it is not intended as a statement to the U.K. or to the world. It is a statement to its own people, particularly to the professional rank-and-file in the Russian intelligence services. The message is this: Betrayal is death, and neither time nor distance can make you safe. We will go anywhere, risk the censure of the world, and hurt whoever happens to be nearby at the time to kill anyone who has betrayed us.And this is not a new message. It is a message with its roots from the time of the Cheka and probably before.N.J.: Should Americans be worried? Should I be worried?S.O.: This is a message from the Russian government to Russian citizens, especially those working in the Russian intelligence services. Betrayal means death. You’re not at risk because you never promised loyalty to Russia. In their view you were bought and paid for and therefore already to be disdained. Just like Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Antony Blunt, etc. They expected to be rewarded, but they were treated as what the Russians considered them to be: traitors to Russia’s enemies. Russia kills its traitors, not other nation’s. The only risk to Americans is the injuries seen in the UK first responders and others near the murder scene. That’s another component which adds to the grave nature of this offense against humanity.

It depends if you are talking about risk to the mission and the national security to the United States, or risk to your career because you are filing a FISA application, approving an operation or trusting an operational asset. Those two things—risk to the mission and to an agent’s career—can get confused in a hurry. The line agents and the professional staff think of risk management as seen as risk to the mission. As soon as you get a little ways up, risk management becomes “what do I do to protect my career and to those around me?” Managers are very reluctant to bring up people who don’t have the \xa0career safety of those around them as their first priority. If you develop a track record of putting the mission first and career second, you don’t get promoted—because nobody wants to be damaged when an arrest or an operation goes sideways.N.J.: With has the impact been on the FBI as both the president and many in Congress attack the FBI and its objectivity?S.O.: For Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe and the less well known executive assistant directors, and also for \xa0Peter Strzok, the focus has been on how those attacks harm our careers and the FBI. The focus has not been on asking “what is our mission, and what are we obligated to do as the FBI?” N.J.: What do you make of McCabe’s firing?S.O.: Nothing unusual happened to Andy McCabe. It’s not unusual for the FBI’s Office of Personal Responsibility and the DOJ inspector general to scrutinize the behavior of FBI personnel when there is a question about whether they acted appropriately. It’s not unusual for an employee to be dismissed just before their retirement benefits vest. It’s also not unusual for a dismissed employee to plead for time to retire, or for that plea to be rejected as it was for McCabe.What’s unusual if for it to happen to someone on McCabe’s lever. The “usual” for someone that high up is for action on the case to be delayed long enough to allow him to retire fully vested. That exception action wasn’t done for McCabe. He was treated like a member of the rank-and-file. And that’s the only unusual thing here. Consequently, I don’t see Trump exercising “illegal command influence” because if he was influencing the process here, it was to ensure the improper privilege often accorded senior FBI executives didn’t happen here. What happened to Andy McCabe is not unusual, and sadly, what Andy McCabe did is not that unusual either. FBI employees usually get fired for lying.N.J.: Was any of the criticism of the FBI for its handling of the Clinton email server investigation or the Russia investigation warranted?S.O.: The question that should have been asked is “what would we be doing with these investigations if this wasn’t an election year?” Instead they were focused on protecting the Bureau’s reputation—and that’s where the investigations went off the rails. \xa0N.J.: With today’s news that Bob Mueller is looking at a relationship Robert Gates and Paul Manafort had with a former Russian military officer, might we now start seeing a direct link to Russian intelligence?S.O.: The facts are similar in significance to a retired CIA case officer doing consulting work. Sure, it's a connection, but the intel services would task active case officers, not retired.You look at intelligence operations they are designed to either collect intelligence from a foreign government without that government knowing that the intelligence has been taken or to influence a foreign government in a non-public way so that there is no blowback. They require sustained covert operations. None of the behavior I have seen described in the press demonstrates trusted people acting on behalf of Russian intelligence organizations. It shows a flat out-effort political effort.N.J.: The indictment also specifically mentioned the GRU, which brought back old memories for me since I worked for you against a GRU officer. What should Americans know about the GRU? What is their focus?S.O.: “GRU” is an acronym which loosely translates as “The Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Military.” It’s their DIA.N.J. What do you think about the meeting at Trump Tower—was it a Russian intelligence operation?S.O.: Absolutely not. Because a meeting like that if it was an intelligence operation, the important thing would be for that meeting not to be noticed or observed. If you’re going to have a covert meeting, you’re not going to do it at Trump Tower. You go back to some of the tradecraft you were taught as a counterintelligence operational asset—to get into and out of a meeting without being noticed. If any of these Russian assets were being tasked by Russian intelligence to meet with the Trumps, they would have chosen anywhere other than Trump Tower.N.J.: What’s the difference between the criminal and counterintelligence divisions of the FBI?S.O.: In criminal matter, generally, you are focused on removing a criminal from the street to significantly curtail their ability to commit crime. In a counterintelligence matter, there are more ways to accomplish the goal removing the person attempting to collect information. For example, we don’t just throw out spies; instead, we often keep a spy in place thinking they are effectively collecting intelligence, when we know that they are not. There are more things that we can do to keep a spy from spying—many of them classified since we don’t want the intelligence agencies of the world to know how we do things—than there are things we can do to stop a criminal.N.J.: One of the things that always surprised me about dealing with the counterintelligence agents as that many of them had less arrests in their entire career then a New York City cop might have in a year. S.O.: Federal officers aren’t cops. They have arrest powers, but only for federal offenses. I was in the Bureau for 21 years and never testified in court and never made an arrest. In fact, we can sometimes define the success of our operation by the type of party the Russian spy has when he gets home. At the end of his tour, that intelligence officer will go home and write up a promotion package based on all of the intelligence that person has collected. And if the FBI counterintelligence officer has done has made sure every sentence that has been sent back is not relevant and is not useful, then it is the counterintelligence officer who has succeeded and only he and the U.S. intelligence community knew it. …You were very frustrated in your case, because you wanted [GRU Officer] Oleg Kulikov to know he had been had. I consider your case to be a huge success with one major exception: the fact that Oleg went home knowing he had been defeated. The case would have been a bigger success if Oleg was sitting around the fireplace in Russia right now drinking with his old comrades in the GRU and talking about how he kicked the FBI’s ass during his time in New \xa0York when the reality is that he didn’t get a damn thing from the U.S. It takes a unique person to feel genuinely satisfied with his job when his opponent thinks he has won and is having a victory party.

 {'title': '‘An Illusion to Think That He Wouldn’t Do This’: Trump Iran Deal Withdrawal Fulfills Wish to Nullify Obama',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The Trump administration’s plans for killing the Iran nuclear deal were never a secret. For one thing, a version has been on the internet, publicly available for all to read, for nearly a year.In August 2017, John Bolton, who has since become President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, laid out a roadmap for a United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the re-imposition of sanctions on the Iranian regime and economy. He wrote it at a time when he was temporarily blocked from seeing Trump—during the newer, stricter regime instituted by chief of staff John Kelly—and when he, Bolton, had to get a bit more creative about getting messages to his future boss.That period of sequester didn’t last long. Even before he became a physical presence at the White House, Bolton had been urging Trump over the phone to pull out of the JCPOA. He advised Trump for months in an unofficial capacity while his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, had been advocating for a diametrically opposite approach.It wouldn’t be fair to say Bolton played the role of anti-Iran puppet master, since Trump himself had grown increasingly irritated by the prospect that he was not only living with, but routinely renewing, former President Barack Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement. But he did act as a counterweight to other voices in the administration—chiefly Defense Secretary James Mattis, who has been far more skeptical of ditching the Iran deal. And by reinforcing the president’s inclinations, he helped pave the way for the public announcement at the White House on Tuesday afternoon that the deal was officially dead.The announcement constituted the most daring international gambit of the Trump presidency to date—a policy decision that rebalances economic relations, diplomatic arrangements, and nuclear negotiations across the globe. It also underscored the ascendance of a new wave of advisers who are echoing and enhancing the president’s characteristic instincts: bellicosity toward American adversaries, closeness with Israel and its political leadership, and antipathy toward anything associated with Trump’s predecessor. Alongside Bolton are newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is also a vehement Iran deal critic, and Trump’s new chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who was a vocal critic of the deal when he eyed a Senate run in 2015.Unlike their predecessors in the administration, this trio is far more ideologically aligned with the president. In some cases, they see him as an avatar for their long-held beliefs.That’s certainly true vis-a-vis Iran. Numerous sources across the administration had said privately for weeks that at the senior level, including in the West Wing and the Treasury Department, officials were preparing for Trump to kill the Iran deal after he repeatedly said his last approval of the deal would in fact be the “last time” he would do so as president. In private conversations over the past several months, Trump has shown little sign—“zero indication, zilch,” in the words of one longtime Trump associate—that he had any desire to remain in the nuclear agreement. Trump would complain often about how “pathetic,” “horrible,” and “lousy” he viewed the deal, multiple sources close to the president told The Daily Beast.“It was an illusion to think that he wouldn’t do this,” one senior White House official said. “People who said he wasn’t going to do what he kept saying he was going to do weren’t following.”But it is one, notably easier, task to end a nuclear deal. It’s quite another to put a separate one back together. And now the job falls to Trump’s new coterie of senior diplomatic and national security officials to renegotiate a deal with Iran and other parties to JCPOA, in conjunction with parallel negotiations over a separate deal with North Korea. If such a deal with the former can’t be reached, it’s not entirely clear how the Trump administration would proceed.Bolton, just one month into the job, described an Iran deal withdrawal as a culmination of months of consultation and preparation. “We’ve been in extensive consultation with [European allies] over the past several months,” he told reporters shortly after the president’s announcement. “Since I’ve been here I’ve spent more time in consultation with them than almost anything else I’ve done.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But those allies appeared to be awaiting some crucial details on where U.S. policy toward Iran goes from here. “Deeply regret US decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal,” wrote U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Twitter. “Await more detail on US plan.”It’s more than a diplomatic question for countries that, under post-2015 sanctions relief, began establishing firm economic ties to the Islamic republic. European Union nations do considerably more business in Iran than does the U.S. Once all U.S. sanctions are re-imposed—within six months at most—American companies will be barred from exporting most goods to the country. But U.S. sanctions could also target foreign companies that do so, unless wide swaths of exemptions are granted for firms in countries that remain party to the deal.The re-imposition of sanctions against Iran is likely to put tremendous pressure on the federal agency tasked with enforcing those measures. But the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has been under-staffed and starving for cash for several years, and officials there are already focusing their efforts on imposing and enforcing sanctions against North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, and other nations. Congressional sources who work with the administration predicted on Tuesday that it would take months for the 200-employee agency to fulfill the White House’s requests—even with a cash infusion on the way.On top of that, even major U.S. companies affected by withdrawal from the deal seemed unsure on how they would proceed. Boeing, which is at risk of losing out on a multibillion-dollar commercial aircraft deal, said in a statement that it would “consult with the U.S. Government on next steps.”At least one Republican senator, Jeff Flake of Arizona, echoed the feeling of uncertainty. A frequent Trump critic who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Flake suggested that the president went against the advice of his own military leaders and diplomats, in addition to that of key U.S. allies with whom the Trump administration will have to work together on other diplomatic efforts including North Korea.Other GOP lawmakers, including Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Susan Collins (R-ME), were hoping that the U.S. and its European partners could work out a framework that would tweak the deal to the Trump administration’s liking. Those efforts stalled out recently, multiple lawmakers and aides briefed on the negotiations told The Daily Beast, even after French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled to Washington to appeal directly to Trump.And with the May 12 deadline approaching, the White House wasn’t willing to wait any longer."},
 {'title': 'Trump Drops the Ax on David Shulkin as Cabinet Purge Continues',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s dramatic reshuffling of his cabinet continued Wednesday with the ouster of Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.“I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” the president tweeted. “In the interim, Hon. Robert Wilkie of DOD will serve as Acting Secretary. I am thankful for Dr. David Shulkin’s service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!”As the president wrote, the now-former veterans affairs secretary will be replaced by Jackson, Trump’s current presidential physician who performed his most recent physical examination. Jackson was appointed to that position in 2013 by President Obama and was retained by Trump.Shulkin’s removal may not be the last high-profile departure from the agency. Two sources familiar with the situation, one within and one outside of the administration, told The Daily Beast that his number two, Deputy Secretary Tom Bowman, is expected to follow Shulkin out the door in the near future.Asked about those expectations, VA spokesman Curt Cashour would only say that Bowman “remains Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs.” But Trump presaged Bowman’s likely departure by announcing an interim head of the agency—Undersecretary of Defense Robert Wilkie—instead of allowing Bowman to serve as acting director, as the VA’s line of succession would otherwise dictate. He’s “not out yet, but will be soon,” said an administration source familiar with the White House’s thinking.Shulkin’s ouster has been expected for weeks, and sources close to the president were waiting all week for what they described as the inevitable tweet. Shulkin himself feared that he would suffer the same fate as outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who learned of his own firing only after the president tweeted about it. But Shulkin’s departure appeared to have been carried out less abruptly.Shulkin, a holdover from the Obama era, served as the head of the nation’s second-largest government agency for little more than a year, a tenure marked by his implication in a widening ethics scandal. Earlier this year, the VA’s Inspector General’s office found that he spent nearly half of a taxpayer-funded ten-day trip to Europe sightseeing with his wife.Shulkin initially defended the jaunt, which included shopping, attending the women’s final at Wimbledon, and a river cruise, as “nothing inappropriate.” The inspector general, however, stated in a report that Shulkin’s chief of staff had lied to investigators and forged an email to justify Shulkin’s wife’s presence on the trip.The report also found that Shulkin had misled investigators about the nature of his relationship with the woman who provided Wimbledon tickets for himself and his wife, describing her as a “friend” of his wife’s instead of a business contact. The woman, when asked by investigators, could not remember Shulkin’s wife’s first name.Sensing increasing pressure due to the ethics investigation, and fearful that he was being undermined by members of his own staff, Shulkin began acting “extremely paranoid” in recent weeks, according to sources familiar with the situation. He went so far as to order an armed guard to stand outside his office.But establishment veterans groups fought for him to stay put, fearful that a replacement would usher in a more aggressive privatization of VA services. And Shulkin had a good rapport with the president as well.

Shulkin’s departure is the latest in a recent string of casualties in an administration where numerous senior officials have broken for the exits. In March alone, the White House has lost a director of the National Economic Council, a secretary of state, a national security adviser, and a communications director.The purge comes five months after Trump mused that his cabinet amounted to “one of the finest group of people ever assembled.”The question now facing the VA is whether Trump’s chosen successor—who has medical and military experience, but little track record as a manager—can effectively steer the federal government’s second-largest agency, and one recently racked by controversy and infighting.“Firing a VA Secretary is easy compared to finding someone who can effectively do the job,” said Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, in a statement on Wednesday evening. “Veterans have seen far too many Secretaries come and go over the last decade and a half. Now that a change of leadership has been announced, we look forward to learning more about Dr. Ronny Jackson’s vision and qualifications.”Concerned Veterans for America, a right-leaning veterans service organization, didn’t mention Jackson by name in its statement, but executive director Dan Caldwell said the group is “hopeful that this change will end the recent distractions at the VA and put the focus back on advancing policy that will ensure veterans get the health care and other benefits they have earned.”"},

  'body': "fo“Where are you watching Stormy?” a friend texted around noon on Sunday, as though the two of us were discussing getting together to watch a mutual pal try out for American Idol. “I have to write about it,” I responded, feigning disappointment. The truth is I couldn’t wait. Watching a man with a long history of unbridled misogyny being dragged into the light by women he felt were disposable is justice porn for this feminist. But there was simply no way CBS’ blockbuster 60 Minutes interview with the porn star who once engaged in mediocre sex with a future president could have lived up to the hype. #StormyDanielsDay trended nationally on Twitter all day long. Everybody I know well enough to Gchat was preparing the metaphorical popcorn. This was after the weeks of intrigue-fluffing from Stormy Daniels’ camp, the steady drip of stories of a panicked White House from other outlets, the quixotic Donald Trump downfall fanfic that a certain sort of person has been writing in their mind since Nov. 9, 2016. A contingent of the public wanted so desperately for this to be enormous that unless Daniels had rolled into the studio armed with the pee tape from the Russia dossier, they were going to be underwhelmed. Much of Daniels’ sit-down with Anderson Cooper was a rehash of the recently unearthed 2011 InTouch interview that kicked off this strange period in American political history. She described meeting the then-reality TV host at a charity golf event in Lake Tahoe in 2006, shortly after Trump’s wife, Melania, had given birth to their son, Barron (who bizarrely has the same name as a surname of an alter ego Donald Trump used for himself back in the 1990s, when he would talk to tabloid journalists on the phone pretending to be his own assistant). Daniels says Trump showed her a Forbes magazine with his face on the cover, and then she spanked him with it. She detailed being physically threatened in a Las Vegas parking lot after giving the aforementioned InTouch interview. The piece discussed the $130,000 payment paid to Daniels days before the 2016 election, a payment that could constitute a violation of federal election law.Most of what Daniels told Cooper wasn’t new. That Trump is a scumbag and a weird guy isn’t new information. That he and his team of daffy henchmen are inept and crook-adjacent isn’t new. But as Trump’s legal woes mount, it’s clear that his propensity to underestimate a certain type of woman is coming back to bite him in the ass. When Daniels first met Trump at that fateful golf tournament in 2006, the future president told the adult film actress that “a lotta people must underestimate [her].” This was after they’d had sex, she said during the 60 Minutes interview. She reminded him of his daughter, Trump said. Trump also underestimated Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate who claims that she and Trump had a consensual, months-long affair around the same time Trump was cheating on his new wife with Daniels. (Side note: What sort of black market horse Viagra was Donald Trump taking between 2005 and 2007?) McDougal is suing Trump for the right to speak about their alleged affair. Appearing on Anderson Cooper 360º last week, she said she had no idea he had “other women” at the time. Trump also apparently told McDougal that she reminded him of his daughter. And Trump seems to have underestimated Summer Zervos, the former Apprentice contestant suing Trump for defamation in New York state court. In 2016, Zervos claimed Trump had made an aggressive sexual pass at her years back, that he dangled professional advancement in the context of sex. Trump called her a liar and expected her to go away. Last week, a New York judge ruled that Zervos’ case can proceed to discovery. Trump underestimates women a lot. It’s served him just fine until this point. He won the presidency even after the Access Hollywood tape featuring his comments on grabbing women by the pussy surfaced. He’s still standing after 19 women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Without Trump’s election, would there have been a Women’s March? Without the power of women’s anger made visible, would the Harvey Weinstein story have ignited the #MeToo movement or quietly faded away in the entertainment section? Stormy Daniels insisted to Anderson Cooper that she was not a victim of Trump’s, that everything she did with her former paramour was consensual. There’s no reason to doubt Daniels’ assessment of her own lived experience. But it’s also foolish to dismiss #MeToo as a force that led to the current cultural space. If not for #MeToo, would people like Daniels and McDougal have come forward with their stories? If they had, would anybody have cared after it blinked past our Twitter feeds? Men like Trump bet against women like Stormy Daniels all the time—workers in the sex industry, young women, poor women, women on the margins. But now those women are more empowered to speak than ever, and more people care than ever. Trump’s karmic reaping was sown long ago. "},
 {'title': 'One Democrat’s Bold Plan to Win Back Rural Trump Voters: Cheap Internet',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In an effort to win back the working-class, Rust Belt voters that fled them for Donald Trump, the Democratic Party has developed a bold progressive policy agenda aimed at hitting populist notes.This includes stark warnings about the concentration of economic power, tougher policies on trade, and an re-embrace of labor and unions. In Michigan, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed has embraced that philosophy. But he's also gone a small step further, with a quirky, more modern policy twist designed to bridge the divide between Democratic urban areas and rural Republican ones. He wants to give people cheap Internet. El Sayed, whose unique bio as a Muslim doctor and public health expert serves as the kind of Democratic ideal in 2018, proposed what he is calling the Internet for All or MI-Fi plan last week, which would essentially create net neutral public broadband in the state. “In today’s world, where the Internet is such a huge part of our lives, not having it is like not having roads in your community,” El-Sayed said in an interview with The Daily Beast. “If you’re a kid, 15, 16-years-old trying to finish your science project and you’ve got dial-up speed internet, you’re not going to be able to do it. And it’s affecting our communities both urban and rural.” El-Sayed’s plan would aim to provide access to high-speed internet throughout the state by 2030, as currently an estimated 1.2 million Michiganders are lacking this access. He would first implement net neutrality in the state, precluding internet service providers from discriminating or charging differently by user or website. Then he would establish a Michigan Internet Office that would coordinate investments in broadband projects and develop publicly-owned broadband networks at the state and local level. What this would produce, in his estimation, is a series of networks run by localities and a state-run provider for areas that could not have their own network. That may all sound technical to the voters. But Sayed has a simple way of pitching it: He would eliminate a monopoly of internet service providers and lower costs for people accessing the Internet. It’s an idea that seems to have some sway. According to a Pew Research Center survey from April 2017, 70 percent of the public believed that “local governments should be able to build their own broadband networks if existing services in the area are either too expensive or not good enough.”To fund the project, El-Sayed is cribbing from Republican Governor Rick Snyder’s 21st Century Infrastructure Commission Report, which “recommends $2 billion in state funding over the next 25 years for broadband expansion.” Out of that total, the current administration recommended that $1.5 billion would fund subsidies for private sector broadband companies to build networks in rural areas. Instead of subsidizing private corporations, El-Sayed would use the money to create broadband networks through public-public partnerships. “I’m just saying that instead of that $1.5 billion subsidizing some big corporation to do the job that they said they want to do in the first place, let’s invest it publicly and make sure that we are empowering local communities through a public trust,” El-Sayed said.

But the approaches taken in the past have largely differed in key ways. Towards the end of his time in office, President Obama proposed offering a subsidy for low-income households to get online. President Trump has similarly discussed the importance of expanding broadband access in rural areas throughout the country, but did not allocate specific funding for it in an infrastructure plan announced earlier this year. And Hillary Clinton pledged to provide broadband access to all American households by 2020 as part of her presidential campaign in 2016. El-Sayed views the plan as part of his broader vision to expand the tent of the Democratic Party and return it to a place where corporations do not dominate the decision-making process. “This is a moment right now in our politics,” El-Sayed said. “People recognize that there’s a unique opportunity to bring politics back to that ideal of for people and by people.” "},
 {'title': 'New Facebook-Backed Law Would Let Foreign Governments Get Your Data Without a Warrant',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Facebook, plunged into crisis by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, is now scrambling to assure users –\xa0and investors –\xa0that this time, their data really, truly is secure. And on a recent post-crisis media blitz, founder Mark Zuckerberg has emphasized that the mass exfiltration of scads of profiles from unsuspecting Facebook users was a vestige of a past privacy practice, not a symptom of anything wrong with current Facebook policy. Yet Facebook urged Congress to pass a measure, the CLOUD Act, that privacy advocates warn makes it easier for a foreign government to acquire Americans’ emails, pics, videos and other online data, and then share that with U.S. law enforcement. It also makes it easier for those foreign governments to get the online lives of their own citizens from the servers of companies like Facebook. Congress tucked the CLOUD Act into its omnibus spending bill – the measure it passed in the wee hours of Friday morning to avert a government shutdown. President Trump, after vacillating, signed it into law today. \xa0\xa0“Despite Facebook\'s promise to take Americans\' personal privacy seriously, it and other big tech companies championed a bill that will let foreign governments directly demand emails and other personal information from those under protection of U.S. law, all without oversight from U.S. courts,” Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, told The Daily Beast on Friday. "Congress has delivered a huge giveaway to big tech companies, at the expense of Americans\' rights. Without one minute of debate, the CLOUD Act was jammed into a must-pass bill to satisfy tech giants.”The CLOUD Act requires telecoms, internet service providers and tech firms to “preserve, backup or disclose the contents of a wire or communication and any record or other information pertaining to a customer or subscriber within such a provider’s possession, custody or control.” Then come the parts that a consortium of tech firms are particularly eager to see enacted. “Congress has delivered a huge giveaway to big tech companies, at the expense of Americans\' rights.”— Senator Ron WydenSuch disclosure, the measure mandates, shall occur “regardless of whether such communication, record or other information is located within or outside the United States.” And it changes existing law to stipulate that it “shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a provider of electronic communication service to the public or a remote computing service” – that is, a cloud-based data storage business, hence the name of the act – “to intercept or disclose the contents of a wire or electronic communication in response to an order from a foreign government that is subject to an executive agreement” certified by the attorney general. In other words, foreign governments now have a warrant-free path to huge amounts of digital data, including those stored on U.S.-based servers – something civil libertarians warn will have severe implications for both Americans and foreigners.Privacy advocates call the new law an end run around the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Under the CLOUD Act, U.S. law enforcement can “grab data stored anywhere in the world, without following foreign data privacy rules,” assessed the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And the U.S.’ foreign partners can set up a Fourth Amendment shell game. Those foreign governments can access Americans’ online communications with foreigners, and if what they find “relates to significant harm, or the threat thereof, to the United States or United States persons,” they can pass it back to the feds. No warrant required.And the part about “executive agreements” represents a major threat to users of services like Facebook in authoritarian countries. The Trump administration and its successors could enter into a handshake deal with foreign governments to turn over data on citizens of those governments targeted for retribution for protesting, organizing or other activity displeasing to tyrants that are stored on the U.S. servers of Facebook, Google or other tech giants. And then, per the language of the law, the tech giants will be compelled to comply.The measure “allows Trump, and any future president, to share Americans\' private emails and other information with countries he personally likes. That means he can strike deals with Russia or Turkey with nearly zero congressional involvement and no oversight by U.S. courts,” Wyden warned in a Thursday statement ahead of the vote on the omnibus.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

That’s a reference to various countries’ divergent laws and privacy protections over law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ access to domestic and foreign-stored data. While the group framed their support in terms of “enhancing and protecting individual privacy rights,” their letter conspicuously referred to permutations of that “reducing conflicts of law” phrase four times in five paragraphs.The rights protections those tech firms lauded in their letter are, in Wyden’s Thursday assessment, “toothless provisions on human rights that Trump’s cronies can meet by merely checking a box.” Signatories to the pro-CLOUD Act letter are Apple, Google, Verizon-owned Oath – which in turn owns Yahoo, Tumblr and AOL –\xa0and Facebook. Zuckerberg emerged Wednesday night after days of deafening silence over the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The Observer and the New York Times had revealed that an app downloaded by 275,000 people and designed by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan had scraped up Facebook profiles for an unsuspecting 50 million people who hadn’t read the fine print of their user agreements and privacy settings. Kogan provided the Trump-connected firm Cambridge Analytica with the data, in violation of Facebook’s then-current policies – but Facebook simply took the firm at its word that the data was deleted. “You know we have a basic responsibility to protect people\'s data and if we can\'t do that then we don\'t deserve to have the opportunity to serve people,” Zuckerberg told CNN. But there was “good news,” he told Recode. “Actually the most important changes to the platform we made in 2014, three or four years ago, to restrict apps like [Kogan’s] from being able to access a person’s ‘friends’ data in addition to theirs.”Asked by The Daily Beast to reconcile Zuckerberg’s recent data-protection assurances with the CLOUD Act, Facebook has yet to provide an answer.

In a Facebook post announcing her decision, Ralston said that McDugle “released a video this morning in which he disrespected and denigrated teachers and administrators who have come to the capitol to protest the legislature’s wholly inadequate support for education.”She went on to say, in comments first reported by the Tulsa World, “If Kevin McDugle won’t fight for teachers and students, then I will.”McDugle’s comments, issued in a now-deleted Facebook Live video, demonstrated his frustration with the teachers protesting at the capitol. The lawmaker said that he voted for previous education-funding measures but the recent walkout changed his mind. “I’m not voting for another stinking measure when they’re acting the way they’re acting,” McDugle said. “You’re losing support of people who supported you all year long. Now you’re going to come here and act like this after you got a raise?”He later apologized for the tirade, saying, “I will continue to vote for teachers.”Still, it was enough to motivate Ralston to challenge him.Comments from the state’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin did nothing to mollify the teachers’ sentiment either. While she signed a bill on Tuesday providing a modest raise to some school staff, Fallin was somewhat dismissive of their more urgent requests. “Teachers want more,” Fallin told CBS. “But it’s kind of like having a teenage kid that wants a better car.”Oklahoma’s massive teacher movement follows a nine-day strike in West Virginia, which ended in an agreement to raise wages. Teachers in Kentucky have similarly mobilized following the passage of a pension bill that would target some teacher benefits.

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "By Jessica Purkiss and Abigail Fielding-SmithA veteran of Pentagon propaganda operations was hired last year to create a film accusing Qatar of links to terrorism, the Bureau can reveal.Charles Andreae, whose firm Andreae & Associates was contracted to produce the film, used to work for PR firm Bell Pottinger. While there, he helped oversee a $500 million contract with the Pentagon to run top secret influence operations during the Iraq war.The new Qatar contract underscores growing concerns about foreign influence campaigns in the heart of Washington. While much focus has been on Russia’s role in the U.S. elections, Persian Gulf countries have also been spending large sums of money pushing their agenda to President Trump’s administration.In August 2017, Andreae, former CEO of Bell Pottinger USA, was given over $500,000 to produce a six-part documentary connecting Qatar with global terrorism.The slickly-produced film, entitled “Qatar: A Dangerous Alliance,” \xa0features conservative pundits talking about Qatar’s links with Islamist groups, interspersed with news and archive footage.Copies of the video were distributed at an event at the Hudson Institute think-tank in October 2017. President Trump’s one-time Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was a keynote speaker at the event, as was former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and General David Petraeus, former CIA director.Though its subject matter is niche and the treatment not especially gripping, the documentary appears to have been viewed more than 700,000 times on YouTube and is also streamable on Amazon.According to Bell Pottinger co-founder Tim Bell, Andrae ran the Washington end of a Pentagon propaganda program in Iraq while at Bell Pottinger. The contract was first revealed by the Bureau and The Sunday Times in 2016. “While much focus has been on Russia’s role in the U.S. elections, Persian Gulf countries have been spending large sums of money pushing their agenda to President Trump’s administration.”The Iraq program included news reports made to look like they were produced by Arab media channels and fake al Qaeda videos used to track the viewers. The Bell Pottinger “psyops” team reported to General Petraeus, who led American forces in Iraq.Bell Pottinger went “into administration” to protect itself from creditors last year after it was implicated in a controversial campaign to stir up racial tension in South Africa.The Qatar film contract came to light in a newly-filed lobbying declaration with the U.S. Department of Justice.

The rift represents a major split between resource-rich countries, both sides of which are key U.S. allies.Shortly after the Lapis contract with Andreae & Associates, the Emirati National Media Council gave a $250,000 contract to a London PR firm. A chunk of this went to SCL Social for an anti-Qatar social media campaign. SCL Social is part of SCL Group which also owns Cambridge Analytica, a firm now mired in controversy over its exploitation of Facebook users’ data. \xa0Charles Andreae also registered as a lobbyist with the U.S. Senate on Qatar-U.S. relations on behalf of Lapis in January this year.Neither Charles Andreae nor anyone from Lapis Communications responded to the Bureau’s requests for comment on this story.According to the New York Times, the political advisor to the UAE’s de facto ruler also sought to push the Gulf state’s agenda in Washington through Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy. The Times reported that Broidy’s company Circinus had received lucrative contracts in the UAE, and that Broidy himself was circulating proposals for an anti Qatar PR campaign in March 2017.Broidy was a donor to the Hudson event where “Qatar: A Dangerous Alliance” was distributed, the Times and McClatchy reported.It is not clear how successful any of the anti-Qatar operations have been. The first YouTube comment underneath the “Dangerous Alliance” video reads: “this video is American propaganda.” The second goes further: “I stand with Qatar”.Qatar has also spent heavily on lobbying in the U.S., and earlier this month, Trump welcomed its Emir to the White House.Whichever side prevails, the Gulf spat has been a boost for PR and lobbying firms. A number of Bell Pottinger’s former employees remain at the heart of global influence operations."},
 {'title': 'Prosecutors Probing Michael Cohen Have Nailed Financial Frauds, Corrupt Pols, and Organized Crooks',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Michael Cohen has never faced attorneys like the ones investigating him.The federal prosecutors looking into Cohen, the longtime lawyer and fixer for Donald Trump, have deep and varied experience with financial crimes such as bank fraud, money laundering, and racketeering. On Friday, they submitted a court filing that gave the first glimpse into the investigation that exploded into the public eye with an FBI raid on Cohen’s office and home on Monday.“The searches are the result of a months-long investigation into Cohen,” according to the filing submitted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, into acts of concealment and fraud he may have committed. While prosecutors did not disclose those acts, the search warrant served on Cohen reportedly sought documents pertaining to his efforts to pay off two women during the 2016 presidential campaign who said they had sex with Trump, among other topics. Cohen claims he paid $130,000 of his own money to Stephanie Clifford, aka porn star Stormy Daniels, in October 2016. In exchange for the money, Clifford signed a nondisclosure agreement stipulating she would not discuss her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen set up a shell company that obscured the payment and the agreement. The other woman, Karen McDougal, claims in a lawsuit that Cohen was secretly involved in her talks with the National Enquirer’s publisher to “catch and kill” her story on Trump.“The prosecutors have deep and varied experience with financial crimes such as bank fraud, money laundering, and racketeering.”Shady financial dealings are what Thomas McKay, Rachel Maimin, and Nicolas Roos are used to digging into. They are the assistant U.S. attorneys who wrote the court filing Friday in response to Cohen’s motion to a federal judge to keep records seized by the FBI out of prosecutors’ hands. McKay and Roos are part of the public corruption unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which goes after corruption crimes committed by government officials, as well as frauds committed against the government. McKay was part of the team that convicted New York’s former Senate majority leader, Dean Skelos, for crimes including using his office to pressure businesses to give his son hundreds of thousands of dollars. The 2015 conviction was overturned by an appeals court thanks to a 2016 Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of corruption; a retrial is scheduled for later this year. Roos recently charged an NYPD detective with bank fraud for stealing $1.5 million from victims by depositing the money into accounts the cop controlled. A month earlier, he charged a graduate school employee and students with conspiracy to commit wire fraud by creating a kickback scheme to pocket financial aid. Last year, he prosecuted an international money laundering scheme to bribe African officials and another plan to con financial institutions and investors into giving loans to phony businesses.Maimin comes from the violent and organized crime section of the attorney’s office, which has seen her prosecute multiple cases of racketeering, including the largest gang takedown in New York history that saw 120 members and associates of two rival Bronx street gangs charged in 2016.'},
 {'title': 'Yes, Jordan Peterson Really Is That Smart',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In the last year, or so, Jordan Peterson, the University of Toronto clinical psychologist turned internet sensation, has emerged as arguably the most important intellectual figure on the right today. His new book, 12 Rules for Life, is No. 1 on Amazon. New York Times columnist David Brooks has called this “The Jordan Peterson moment,” and The Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf has puzzled over why liberal interviewers don’t seem to hear what he is saying. As you might expect, controversy has followed, most recently having to do with a negative review about his book. In response to a New York Review of Books essay by the Indian novelist and essayist Pankaj Mishra titled, “Jordan Peterson & Fascist Mysticism,” Peterson tweeted at Mishra: “And you call me a fascist? You sanctimonious prick. If you were in my room at the moment, I’d slap you happily.”Not since William Buckley threatened Gore Vidal has intellectual pugilism been so accessible to the masses. Peterson doesn’t mind honest criticism of his book, but this was a bit much. Aside from calling Peterson a fascist, Mishra wrote about Peterson’s friendship with a Native American on Vancouver Island, saying that Peterson was “pretentiously but harmlessly romancing the noble savage.” “To me, that just crossed the line,” Peterson said. “I’ve been helping [his Native American friend] develop his artistic career… for 15 years. I thought that was a really dirty blow, and I also thought it was racist.” Still, should Peterson have pushed back so hard? Twitter “rewards impulsivity,” Peterson concedes, “but he went somewhere that I don’t think it was acceptable to go… I think if a conservative writer had said what he said, they would have been absolutely taken apart.” Fair enough. But it’s also interesting that Peterson got away with calling someone a “sanctimonious prick.” He wasn’t “taken apart” for saying that. When Jordan Peterson calls someone a “sanctimonious prick,” I tend to believe him. If Sean Hannity said that about someone, I wouldn’t buy it. In a world where the right is coming apart, Peterson bridges divides. His fans on the right are a disparate and motley crew. He can have David Brooks sing his praises, but a lot of Trump supporters treat him with equal reverence.Although Peterson has emerged as one of the most important thinkers on the right, the fact that he hails from Canada, plus the fact that focuses primarily on hot-button culture-war issues such as the war on men, illiberalism on college campuses, and political correctness run amok, means that he has said surprisingly little about American domestic politics. So would he have voted for Donald Trump? You might think this question would have elicited a slam dunk “Yes!” coming from a man who has become something of a regular guest on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight. “Jesus,” says Peterson, “that’s a hard question.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“I think what I would have done was walk into the voting booth with the intention of voting for Clinton, and then, at the last minute, gone, ‘To hell with it. I’m not doing it,’ and voted for Trump,” he said. (Listen to streaming audio of my full 47-minute conversation with Jordan Peterson or download the podcast on iTunes.) Like many on the right, this is a question he struggles with.“For the entire election, virtually, I thought, well, Clinton has the experience necessary to at least keep the status quo in motion. So, in some sense, she was a conservative choice,” he continued. “Because she’d been in politics so long.” Ultimately, though, Peterson became concerned about Clinton’s ideological direction. Likewise, he believes that Americans concluded they liked “the unscripted, impulsive lies of Trump better than the conniving, scripted lies of Clinton.” “I think I would have impulsively voted for Trump at the last moment,” Peterson concedes. “But it wouldn’t have been with a sense of delight—I can tell you that.” This was an academic exercise for a Canadian, but the fact that he reasoned through this hypothetical question, and answered with a sort of intellectual honesty is why Jordan Peterson matters—and why economics professor Tyler Cowen says he’s our most influential public intellectual (even if he doesn’t know it yet). The smart answer for a guy pandering to the Fox News crowd would be to praise Trump. The smart answer for a professor trying to win friends in academia would be to praise Clinton. But Peterson did neither: He thought about it. And his nuanced answer is the kind that we don’t see enough from political commentators these days. Unlike the recent slew of rising star right-wing politicians and pundits who predictably let us down by playing to the lowest common denominator, don’t expect Peterson, a 55-year-old professor turned “overnight” internet sensation, to fall prey to the same temptations. In a world where the most talked about conservative celebrities tend to come from the anti-intellectual fever swamps (or pretend to), Peterson has emerged as a bit of a unicorn: a bona fide academic who still sounds like a professor, has cultivated a huge following on YouTube and social media, and generally drives the left crazy by attacking identity politics and political correctness in eloquent fashion.For what it’s worth, Peterson doesn’t see himself as a conservative, so much as a “terrified traditionalist” who generally believes in exercising caution over endorsing sweeping or radical cultural changes. \xa0He is an academic. He sounds like an academic. He isn’t abandoning his academic credentials. Not since Buckley has the right boasted such firepower. It’s no wonder people are so mad. "},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "John Vigna still regrets what happened in 2012.He was press secretary for California’s Assembly speaker that cycle. And Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA) was running for Congress in California’s 31st Congressional District—favorable terrain for Democrats. Aguilar was the top Democratic vote-getter in the primary. But because of the newly instituted “jungle primary” rules, in which the top two vote getters of either party advanced to the general election, he never made it to the next round. His 22.6 percent was good enough for third. It was a wasted opportunity, one that would take two years to fix, when Aguilar ran again and went on to win. “It left a very bitter taste in everyone’s mouth,” Vigna, communications director for the California Democratic Party told The Daily Beast. Six years later, it could all happen again only on a much grander, more consequential, scale. Voters in California head to the polls on June 5. And with Democrats leaning heavily on the state to deliver some of the 23 flipped seats needed to wrest back control of the House, the jungle-primary rule may once again trip them up. For months, Democrats have entertained the possibility of it happening. But with election day approaching, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is now taking aggressive steps to prevent what some strategists view as a calamity. Officials at the committee said they have been investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in voter registration efforts, ads, and get-out-the-vote programs, which specifically target three districts represented by retiring Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), incumbent Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and retiring Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA). In addition, California Democrats have struck an agreement between two Democratic campaigns to cease negative ads against each other in the particularly nasty primary in California’s 39th District. And on Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced that members would be picking sides in some of the primary battles.“They may be subjected to criticism for that,” Pelosi said, “but I’d rather be criticized for winning than criticized for losing.”And criticized they have been. Some California activists are furious at the national party’s intervention, viewing it as putting its thumb on the scales for their preferred candidate.Those tensions boiled over this past week when the DCCC decided to add businessman Harley Rouda, a Democrat, to its coveted “Red to Blue” program. The decision meant that the committee would be prioritizing Rouda’s attempt to unseat Rohrabacher. It sparked a carefully worded rebuke from the CDP, which had endorsed another Democrat in the race, Dr. Hans Keirstead (PDF). “Throughout our partnership, I have been consistently clear on one key point: when CDP Delegates endorse a candidate, that candidate is the official candidate of the Party, and the DCCC should tread carefully in openly supporting a different candidate,” chair Eric Bauman wrote.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.National Democrats are sensitive to the charge and California Democrats acknowledge that the two have the same ultimate goals. Increasingly, however, national officials feel that it’s a price worth paying. That’s because few stretches may be more critical toward winning back control of the House of Representatives than the one coming up. With the congressional generic ballot poll numbers between the two parties having narrowed, national officials are keeping a watchful eye on races in Kentucky, Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, and other states where voters will head to the polls in the next two weeks.So far, the party remains bullish about its prospects. For good reason. Even if they find their candidates locked out in certain California contests, there are opportunities elsewhere. A new map in Pennsylvania gives Democrats a strong chance of flipping five-plus seats in the House. Democrats are hopeful for gains in New York and New Jersey as well. They also have managed to lessen some of the tension in contests elsewhere. After the DCCC was widely criticized for putting out an opposition research memo on Democratic candidate Laura Moser in Texas’ 7th Congressional District, feuds between candidates and the committee have calmed down. In Kentucky, a primary race in the state’s 6th Congressional District has also gone from dicey to more civil—at least for now. Former fighter pilot Amy McGrath’s campaign was initially furious with the DCCC for encouraging Lexington Mayor Jim Gray to jump into the race, believing that they had already proved their capacity to run a strong general election contest. But in April, McGrath’s campaign manager Mark Nickolas said their campaign shared polling with the DCCC showing McGrath up seven points in the primary. Nickolas insisted that the DCCC “concluded that their initial analysis was wrong” though Gray’s campaign also publicly released a poll showing him handily winning the primary and said they didn’t buy McGrath’s numbers.“I told her, you know it’s not a personal thing,” Nickolas said in an interview with The Daily Beast. “They just sort of view this as Gray’s more likely to win. The best revenge is just winning.”The DCCC, for its part, has backed off from outright supporting either candidate in the race, with a committee aide stressing that general election polling indicates incumbent Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) is vulnerable against either candidate. But it’s also clear that the detente is delicate. McGrath’s campaign was incensed on Friday about a new negative ad from Gray that painted her overseas service as a negative, to the degree that it had kept her away from the district. The DCCC has found itself having to manage political fires elsewhere. Just last Tuesday, nonprofit executive Kara Eastman took down former Rep. Brad Ashford (D-NE) while running on a platform including Medicare for All in the sought-after 2nd Congressional District in Nebraska.Ashford had been included in the DCCC’s Red to Blue program. And his loss not only suggested that the national committee was losing its ability to move voters in key races, but raised the possibility of lingering tensions with the party’s general election candidate. Eastman, however, said in an interview that there was no bad blood. “Ben Ray Lujan called me,” Eastman said referring to the chairman of the DCCC. “[Rep.] Steny Hoyer called. I’m confident that we’ll be able to work together moving forward.” At the moment, there aren’t specifics as to what kind of cooperation there will be, but Eastman’s comments underscore the necessity the party sees in making sure there are few intra-party squabbles as Democrats face a historic opportunity in November.“We will just continue to unite, because we need a unified party and that’s really what the voters deserve,” Eastman told The Daily Beast.

 {'title': 'Sessions, Risking Trump’s Wrath, Doesn’t Appoint Special Counsel to Investigate FBI',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Attorney General Jeff Sessions told congressional leaders on Thursday that he has elected not to appoint a special counsel to investigate allegations that the FBI misused its surveillance powers, in a move that could potentially further alienate the nation’s top law enforcement official from President Donald Trump.In a letter addressed to the chairs of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee, Sessions said that he was bound by Justice Department regulations allowing for the appointment of a special counsel under “only the most ‘extraordinary circumstances,’” and has therefore elected instead to task a U.S. attorney with overseeing the review instead.“In high-profile circumstances involving other politically sensitive matters, it has been more common to make special arrangements within the Department to ensure that actual or apparent conflicts can be avoided,” Sessions said in the letter. Only if “the public interest would be served by removing a large degree of responsibility… from the Department of Justice,” Sessions continued, would he consider appointing a special counsel to conduct the investigation.That determination will be made, in part, by the career DOJ official Sessions has put in charge of the investigation. U.S. Attorney John W. Huber of Utah, a career prosecutor who has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, has been tasked with leading the review. In the letter, Sessions noted that Huber is “an experienced federal prosecutor who was twice confirmed unanimously by the Senate.”Asked when exactly Huber had begun evaluating issues raised by the committees addressed in the letter, Department of Justice spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores told The Daily Beast only that Huber started “in advance of the Nov. 13th letter.” In that November letter, sent by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd to the House Judiciary Committee, congressional leaders were told that “senior prosecutors” reporting directly to Sessions “will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened.”Congressional conservatives have pushed for a review of the FBI’s response to Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information, the FBI’s use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrants to monitor former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, and allegations that a foundation linked to a Canadian uranium mining company donated to the Clinton Foundation in order to facilitate government approval of that firm’s sale to a Russian nuclear energy corporation.Despite Sessions’ professed confidence “that Mr. Huber’s review will include a full, complete and objective evaluation of these matters in a manner that is consistent with the law and facts,” the decision to hold off on appointing a Robert Mueller-type special counsel to investigate the FBI and Clinton will likely frustrate some Republican lawmakers—as well as Sessions’ boss.“Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse,” President Trump tweeted last month, upon news that Sessions had also move to enlist the Department of Justice’s inspector general to look into potential FISA abuses. “Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!”The White House did not immediately respond to a request regarding Sessions’ decision to not appoint a special counsel.'},
 {'title': 'Trump Lawyer Rudy Giuliani Says Mueller Probe No Longer ‘Legitimate’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'One of President Donald Trump’s attorneys, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, declared on Sunday that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia is no longer “legitimate.”Giuliani said on CNN’s State of the Union that he believed the investigation was legitimate when he joined the president’s legal defense team just last month. But he cited the revelation the FBI used a confidential informant during the investigation as a reason why the probe is now tainted.“I did [think the probe was legitimate] when I came in, but now I see Spygate,” Giuliani said, using Trump’s misleading term to describe the FBI’s use of an informant who spoke with three Trump campaign officials in 2016 during the counter-intelligence investigation into Russian election meddling.“Either it’s evidence or not. And if it’s not, it goes along with what they found already, which is no collusion with the Russians,” Giuliani said, referring to a Republican-authored report from the House Intelligence Committee.The Democratic participants in a meeting with top Justice Department officials on Thursday said there was “no evidence” that the U.S. government sent a “spy” into the Trump campaign. And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on ABC’s This Week that he has “seen no evidence” that the informant was seeking information about the Trump campaign—rather, he said, the FBI was looking into “individuals with a history of links to Russia that were concerning.” He said the government’s actions were appropriate.“When individuals like that are in the orbit of a major political campaign in America, the FBI, who is in charge of counter-intelligence investigations, should look at people like that,” Rubio added.In a separate interview on Fox News Sunday, Giuliani listed conditions that would need to be met before he allows Trump to be interview by Mueller’s team—and cast doubt on the prospects of it happening at all.“We sure as heck are not going to testify unless this is all straightened out, unless we learn the basis of that Russia investigation—they’re not going to tell us because the basis is going to turn out, when it’s spread to Trump, to be unethical or illegal,” he said. “Gee, maybe they should wake up and realize the president is innocent. That’s why he wants to testify. And because of them, we don’t want him to testify because they’re not fair. They have rigged this investigation against him.”On CNN, Giuliani said he and the other lawyers representing Trump are confident that the president could answer questions about potential collusion between Trump associates and Russian operatives “because there has been none.” But he said he is “not as comfortable” with questions about obstruction of justice, a key aspect of Mueller’s investigation which centers around Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.“There’s no proof of collusion, so stop the investigation,” Giuliani said. He said the president would not fire Mueller because that would “play into the hands” of his opponents.Trump has tweeted several times about the Mueller investigation throughout the Memorial Day weekend, dubbing it “rigged” against him. He also suggested that the “crooked highest levels of the FBI or ‘Justice’” never informed him about Russia’s intentions to weaponize his presidential campaign. NBC News reported in December that, in fact, top FBI officials briefed him about it during the summer of 2016, shortly after he clinched the Republican presidential nomination.'},
 {'title': 'Trump’s New Lawyer Likely to Cut Him Off From Mueller Interview: Source',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump’s legal team became significantly more cohesive on Wednesday with the addition of Emmet Flood, a veteran white collar defense attorney. It also became more aggressive, which could prove tricky for special counsel Bob Mueller.A longtime Washington lawyer who’s known Flood for quite some time and who spoke anonymously because of client sensitivities said there’s no chance Flood will let the president sit for an interview with Mueller. “Mueller finally has somebody who’s his match,” that person said. “You’ve got a fair fight now.”The person also said White House counsel Don McGahn played a significant role in bringing Flood onto the president’s legal team—pushing for him to be offered Ty Cobb’s job and working to convince him to take the position. McGahn and Cobb reportedly had frequent clashes about how to handle the president’s legal woes, and Cobb was overheard complaining about McGahn at the BLT Steak restaurant a few blocks from the White House. With Flood, the president’s lawyers are likely to be more unified in an aggressive posture toward Mueller. “He comes across like a Columbo-type—unassuming, but the intellect is gargantuan,” the person added. Flood will step into live negotiations between the president’s lawyers and Mueller’s team. The Washington Post reported yesterday that Mueller’s lawyers have floated the possibility of subpoenaing the president. Such a move would likely lead to a protracted court battle. Flood’s roots are in top legal circles, and he has extensive experience in high-profile political investigations. He clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia and was a junior lawyer on the team that helped then-President Bill Clinton navigate impeachment proceedings. He went on to the White House Counsel’s office under George W. Bush where he was known for the work he did on the scandal related to the firings of U.S. attorneys. Members of Congress lambasted that White House for not letting senior staffers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten testify, and ultimately held the pair in contempt. But the Justice Department declined to prosecute the pair for stiff-arming the Hill and Flood was a central White House lawyer managing that crisis, according to a longtime Washington attorney who knows him. “I’m frankly surprised that he’s willing to do it,” that attorney said of Flood’s decision to join the Trump White House. “He’s a patriot for stepping up.”It was during the transition from the Bush presidency to Obama when Flood met Norm Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, who served as Obama’s special counsel at the time. “He’s one of the greats in defending scandals involving government officials. Maybe the best, in my generation,” Eisen said of Flood.“These scandals run hot, and he has the gift of cooling them down and slowing them down. It is like the way Neo slows down time in the Matrix to dodge bullets.” David Rivkin, a former Justice Department and White House official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, also said he expects Flood to be more combative than Cobb. “It’s a definite step up from Ty Cobb,” Rivkin told The Daily Beast. “He’s not a constitutional lawyer, but he is first-rate.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'In Ohio, an Attempt at a New Form of Journalism to Restore Public Trust',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "The public doesn’t trust the news media, which President Trump uses to his advantage, labeling stories he doesn’t like fake news. An effort to rebuild the public’s faith in journalism, Your Voice Ohio, got its start in late 2015 when Trump’s candidacy was getting more laughs than serious scrutiny, public disgust with the media was rising, and newsrooms everywhere were shrinking. It was not a happy time for anyone, except maybe Trump, when Doug Oplinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning managing editor with the Akron Beacon Journal, spearheaded an Ohio media collaborative of several major news outlets determined to restore that trust. A National Institute for Civil Discourse three-day retreat in Columbus provided that incentive when it brought together journalists, citizens, and local officials to understand why public trust had broken down, and how to rebuild it. Each group was asked to list adjectives it associated with the other groups. The journalists used words like “lazy, “busy” and “apathetic” to describe the citizens, and ones like “power hungry,” “in it for the money” and “corrupt” for the officials.\xa0Journalists described themselves as “hard-working and under-appreciated,” rather self-serving. Worse, they didn’t realize their answers would be displayed on a white board for all to see. “When the citizens saw this, they said ‘Holy shit,’ this confirms what we thought,” says Oplinger.The local officials were not all that complimentary about the citizens either, Oplinger told The Daily Beast. It was an eye-opening experience and directly led to Oplinger’s launching “Your Voice Ohio,” which began small in 2016 with six or eight news outlets participating, and is now a consortium with 40 Ohio media outlets contributing community focused content. Multiple polls and dozens of focus groups pointed the way to this formula: stories that are fact laden with charts and graphs, include a narrative description of struggle on different sides, and most importantly, offer ways to resolve those struggles. Every story ends with solutions proposed by citizens from their lived experience, not from politicians and experts. Research found that people resent the media for laying out problems without offering solutions, and that they blame the media for their inability to talk to each other in a civil manner. Every Your Voice Ohio story on opioids, for example, posts a hot line at the bottom to call for help. Even though Your Voice Ohio was in the field throughout the 2016 campaign, and should have seen Trump coming, the results were “a shocker,” says Oplinger. The media felt repudiated by the outcome. Ohio had gone over the cliff economically, people were tired of career politicians telling them how to fix it, and the media were in no-where’s land. With infusions of grant money from the Knight Foundation and the Democracy Fund, Your Voice Ohio redoubled its efforts to find a way to connect with the public. There was more polling after the election, and the economy emerged as the top issue. “But the opioid crisis was out of control,” says Oplinger, with 4,000 deaths a year, out pacing traffic deaths and placing Ohio among the hardest hit in the nation, along with West Virginia and Kentucky. “Journalists were going out of their minds writing stories that weren’t having any impact,” he says. With help from the Jefferson Center, a citizen-engagement organization in St. Paul, Minnesota, thousands of postcards went out across Ohio to recruit a cross section of people to sit on three-day citizen juries in their community to meet with news media outlets. “Initially they said the news media is biased and they trashed us something awful,” says Oplinger. After journalists explained how they approached a story, and took questions, attitudes shifted. “They said they had no idea journalism is that difficult. They told us, ‘You need to be more transparent. Tell us how hard you work to get information.’ They want to be involved. They want to feel part of journalism so they can take ownership.” The goal of Your Voice Ohio is to get journalists to think differently about their relationship with the public and with politicians and community leaders. The consortium documented what everyone should have known, that a lot of people are falling through the cracks when it comes to addiction treatment and recovery.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.These community conversations have been held all over Ohio. The most recent one in Central Ohio highlighted the fact that addiction doesn’t discriminate, it strikes people in all walks of life, and is much broader than just struggling with opioids. People in recovery had the opportunity to directly share their experiences with community officials. One attendee told the Marion Star, “Recovery doesn’t have a face or a name, it looks like anybody and everybody.” The media were told that the stock photo of a needle going into an arm to illustrate the addiction crisis serves as an unwelcome trigger for people in recovery. The consortium pulled all such photos from its archive. Asked if this community-focused coverage has made a dent in Ohio’s opioid crisis, Oplinger demurred, claiming credit only to the extent that shared data and information can help communities. And that’s the point, the dissemination of a common set of facts from sources people trust is essential to democracy. Oplinger has a history in Ohio that made it possible for him to bring people together. He was an editor on several Pulitzer projects, and had won many local and national awards, plus 40-odd years of service at the Akron Beacon Journal gave him the cachet to create what could be a model for other states and localities to follow. In the next few weeks, Your Voice Ohio will shift focus to the economy in a way that gives voters the tools to make sense of the midterm elections. “We will not use the word economy,” he says. “We’ll be asking people how they envision a more vibrant Ohio.” This kind of community-based journalism sees the public as partners. Frame the right question and the answers will follow. Build it and they will come. "},
 {'title': 'Trump Rage-Tweets That Michael Cohen Won’t Snitch on Him. Privately, He Tells Folks: ‘We’ll See.’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "President Donald Trump woke up on Saturday morning at his Florida estate and club Mar-a-Lago. His wife, First Lady Melania Trump, was preparing to attend the Texas memorial service for Barbara Bush, the recently departed matriarch of the Bush political dynasty. And there was nothing pressing—in fact, nothing at all—on his own public schedule. So Trump went golfing. But on his way to Trump International Golf Club in suburban West Palm Beach, he checked his phone first, looking down into the device as he sat in the back of his motorcade. And then, as is his want, he rage-tweeted.“The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will ‘flip,’” President Trump posted to Twitter. “They use........non-existent ‘sources’ and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected.”Two Trump associates and one White House official who The Daily Beast asked about these Saturday morning posts all deduced, based on interactions with the president, that the “drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael” to whom Trump referred was Sam Nunberg, a former political adviser and aide who was prominently quoted in the recent Times article that irked the president. Nunberg did not respond to inquiries from The Daily Beast. Neither did the White House press shop.President Trump concluded his tirade by tweeting, “Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if........it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!”While public outbursts are hardly new for this president, the one that took place on Saturday was uniquely loaded in its legal and political implications. The tweets may have been directed at Haberman. But their intended audience was largely Cohen.Trump’s personal attorney and notorious fixer finds himself in legal crosshairs after his office and residence were raided by the feds. And over the past week, there have been several reports that close Trump allies and senior White House aides are actively concerned about, and trying to game out, what to do if Cohen flips. Jay Goldberg, one of Trump’s longtime legal advisers, even told The Wall Street Journal that he spoke with the president in recent days about Cohen and specifically cautioned Trump about putting his trust in Cohen to stay loyal if there are criminal charges. Three different officials and associates in Trumpworld independently expressed worry to The Daily Beast this month that Cohen could quickly become just another “snitch.” The premise that there is something to “snitch” about was simply taken for granted. And it’s infused public commentary about the issue too. “Is [Michael Cohen] wilting under the feds’ pressure tactics? Why is he giving [interviews] to news outlets hostile to @realDonaldTrump? We address that & much more—10p ET @FoxNews,” host Laura Ingraham—a close ally to the Trump family who interviewed for the job of Trump's White House press secretary—tweeted on April 10.Multiple sources who have spoken with Trump about this insisted to The Daily Beast in recent days that the president is not completely losing his faith in Cohen’s loyalty.

When it comes to how Cohen will stand up—or fall down—under pressure, several people close to President Trump have noticed him uttering a familiar refrain and vocal tic: “We’ll see.”Cohen, for his part, has long held himself out as an unbreakable ally to the president, even though there are numerous questions about how the president treats and feels about him.“I’d rather jump out of a building than turn on Donald Trump,” Cohen reportedly said earlier this month. Those close to the president—as well as, and perhaps especially, the president himself—are watching closely to see how strongly that statement holds.“How tall is the building?” one senior White House official asked."},

  'body': "Following an explosive report that he sexually abused three teenagers while working as a high-school basketball coach, Tennessee Republican state Rep. David Byrd refuses to resign—and even plans to seek re-election.Byrd, apparently called “coach” in the legislature, allegedly sexually assaulted the 15- and 16-year-old girls more than 30 years ago before he went on to become principal of Wayne County High School, the women recently told WSMV-TV.Byrd was 28 years old and working as head coach when Christi Rice says he abused her, according to the interview, which aired on Tuesday night.“He was like, ‘You owe me, you owe me, I been thinking about what I want, I want to see you naked,’” Rice told the news station.Robbie Cain, who graduated in 1988, said Byrd abused her in a hotel pool during an out-of-town trip. “His words were: ‘I want you to feel how you make me feel. I want you to feel it throbbing,’” Cain said. “It’s an embarrassing part of my past I wish to forget.”A third, unidentified teammate said her encounter with Byrd happened in a hotel room during another basketball trip.Byrd allegedly apologized to Rice, according to WSMV-TV reporter Alanna Autler, who obtained a recording of their phone conversation.“I can promise you one thing, I have been so sorry for that,” Byrd said in the recording, though he never specifies exactly what transpired between them. “I've lived with that and you don't know how hard it has been for me.”“I hope you forgive me,” he reportedly added.Byrd is married with children and grandchildren, according to his legislative website.Waynesboro Police Chief Walter Smith told the Tennessean that he was unaware of the allegations until the story aired. It is unclear if the department plans to open an investigation into the legislator’s past behavior.Several lawmakers, including fellow Republican and Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell and Lt. Gov.

 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani May Have Accidentally Outed Trump for Breaking the Law Over Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Rudy Giuliani may have put his new client, the president of the United States, in a bad spot. In attempting to head off allegations of illegal fundraising, he may have implicated Trump in an entirely different violation of federal law.In Fox News interviews on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Giuliani disclosed, among other pertinent details, that hush money paid to the porn star Stormy Daniels in October 2016 came from Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen. But contrary to past claims by Trump and his former attorney, Giuliani said in an interview with Sean Hannity, Trump reimbursed him for the $130,000 paid to ensure Daniels’ silence on her alleged affair with the president.This explanation would, in theory, head off allegations that the $130,000 amounted to an illegal contribution to Trump’s campaign. But in detailing the structure of the payments, Giuliani may have admitted that Trump fudged federal ethics paperwork—paperwork that his lawyers tried, unsuccessfully, to keep Trump from swearing was true and accurate.By Giuliani’s account, Cohen’s payment to Daniels was effectively a loan, as he knew it would be repaid per the terms of his agreement with Trump. Giuliani insists that it was not a loan to the campaign, which would have amounted to an illegal contribution. Trump’s repayment was entirely a personal expense designed to avoid personal embarrassment, Giuliani explained. Hence, Cohen’s payment was in effect a loan to Trump personally, which Trump would later repay.Framing the payment that way could head off allegations of campaign finance violations, though even that is not clear. But Giuliani’s position could be lose-lose for Trump. “If [the] Cohen loan was not one to [the] campaign, then it was one to you, and you omitted it from your personal federal financial disclosures for the period,” noted Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer, in a tweet on Thursday. “That’s a crime under 18 USC 1001 & we have filed a criminal complaint with DOJ.”The complaint, filed by Eisen’s left-leaning group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in March, cited media reports surrounding Cohen’s payment to Daniels. Those reports, effectively confirmed by Giuliani on Thursday, indicated the payments amounted to a financial liability. But such a liability was not disclosed in Trump’s personal financial statements filed with federal ethics officials last year.Under the Ethics in Government Act, most federal officeholders, including the president, must file annual reports that give a full accounting of their finances, including income, assets, and liabilities, among other information. The report that Trump filed last year disclosed no debts owed to either Cohen or Essential Consultants LLC, the company he used to make payments to Daniels.“The parties involved in the transaction apparently took extreme measures to ensure that their identities would not be disclosed,” CREW wrote in its complaint to the Justice Department and the Office of Government Ethics. “These facts suggest President Trump’s failure to report the loan may have been done both knowingly and willfully.”In April, as Trump’s attorneys gathered information for a financial disclosure report covering 2016 and early 2017, those attorneys met with officials from the Office of Government Ethics. At that meeting, according to correspondence subsequently reported by the Associated Press, Trump’s attorneys requested that Trump be excused from legally certifying that the disclosure of his assets and liabilities was accurate and complete. OGE balked and required that he do so.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

 {'title': 'What Happened to Jill Stein’s Recount Millions?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'Shortly after the 2016 election, Jill Stein raised more than $7 million from shell-shocked liberals eager to pursue a swing-state recount. Nearly two years later, the U.S. Green Party’s last candidate for president is still spending that money.Ongoing litigation, travel costs, and staff salaries are also likely to eat up whatever is left, meaning those who donated to Stein are unlikely to receive a once-promised chance to vote on how the post-recount money would be spent. Nor have donors been given much of a window into how Stein is actually spending their donations.The last FEC filing from the Stein campaign was for the month of September 2017. And the last update from the campaign itself came in a post on April 20, in which it said it was down to $932,178 in recount funds. “It is strange that they would just stop filing reports given they were a legitimate, professional campaign, and despite still having more than a million dollars in cash on hand,” Andrew Mayersohn, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, told The Daily Beast.Jonathan S. Abady, an attorney with Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP, the New York-based firm that represents Stein and her campaign, told The Daily Beast that legal efforts on the recount persist to this day. But the opacity surrounding the expenditure of money—combined with the fact that a good chunk of the spending has come after all efforts to recount the vote were terminated—has fed criticism that Stein was more interested in boosting her political operations than in recounting votes. It’s also drawn the ire of regulators. In a May 7, 2018 letter, the FEC warned Stein campaign treasurer Steven Welzer that he was violating federal law by not accounting for half a year of spending. “The failure to timely file this report may result in civil money penalties, suspension of matching funds, an audit or legal enforcement action,” the letter states, noting there is no grace period.From the moment Stein started raising money for a recount, there were reasons to be skeptical. The Green Party’s nominee for president was “launching an effort to ensure the integrity of our elections,” asking for $2.5 million, getting it, doubling the goal and then doubling it again. All of this was done after Stein publicly dismissed reports that Russian state actors had sought to undermine the integrity of the vote and after seeming increasingly unconcerned with who actually won in November. Cynics smirked, believing Stein was just cashing in on the shock of Hillary Clinton’s defeat and trying to stifle the criticism that she had been a “spoiler.” She was the first in a legion of #Resistance grifters, in this telling—a charge amplified by President-elect Donald Trump. In reality, it wasn’t even Stein’s idea to contest the results. Well-respected computer scientists, in need of legal standing and a proxy, urged her to do it after the Clinton campaign declined. That she raked in more than $7.3 million raised eyebrows, but that money was freely given by people who wanted her to pursue the costly process of double checking the ballots. In exchange, the Stein campaign promised to let the approximately 161,000 donors \xa0exercise their right to vote on how to disperse any money left over.“Once those costs are finalized, all remaining money will go to a set of non-partisan election reform and voting rights organizations based on your input in an online, ranked choice vote,” Stein wrote in a letter to donors; though, at other times, she and her campaign said it was unlikely there would be any money left over."We are raising money into a dedicated account for a recount campaign. The money cannot be used for anything else. It cannot be used for my campaign. It cannot be used for the Green Party. It can only be used for the recount," she added during an interview on ABC.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Stein campaign spokesperson Dave Schwab said, after this story was published, that there still could be a plebiscite. "[W]e will poll donors on what to do with surplus funds once recount-related litigation is over and we are able to establish a surplus," Schwab told The Daily Beast. But he did not provide more detail on how money is being used, outside of the litigation.Running a recount is actually quite expensive. Filing fees to request the recounts in Wisconsin and Michigan alone cost over $2.3 million. Attorney fees have taken some $2.6 million from the pot. Abady, one of the recount lawyers, told The Daily Beast that the Stein campaign is still seeking access “to the software used in Wisconsin’s voting systems.” On March 15, the Wisconsin Elections Committee granted that request, Abady said, a decision immediately challenged by two voting system vendors who don’t want anyone prying in to their proprietary source code. Stein has also “brought a separate challenge concerning the scope of the software inspection permitted to her,” Abady added. “Both challenges are before the same judge in Wisconsin state court and he will likely set a briefing schedule in the next few weeks.”In Pennsylvania, Abady said, the legal effort concerns a “broken election system” that “forces voters to use unreliable machines and denies them the ability to make sure their votes were counted.” The Stein team, he added, “filed an amended complaint in February 2017 that focuses on reforming the system for future elections” Preparing for future elections, however, is distinctly different than relitigating the past one, raising questions as to whether it falls under the purview of a formal recount effort. Other expenditures have raised similar questions. According to Stein’s April 20 update, more than $363,900 has been spent on “Media” even though, in 2016, donors were told that media expenses “could go up to $300K.” Other costs are more in line with predictions. By 2018, the campaign had spent $820,000 on “Travel and Events, “Staff support,”and “Recount observer costs.” Another $150,000 was set aside for a “Compliance reserve” — a total slightly under estimates that CBS reported in December 13, 2016.Much of the spending has taken place long since any hope for more recounts came to an end. Of the more than $509,000 spent on staff, more than $300,000 has been spent since February 20, 2017, according to the Stein campaign. The same is true for 87 percent of travel and events spending.As the Center for Responsive Politics has noted, U.S. law dictates that funds raised for a recount “only go toward expenses directly related to the recount, such as paying state staff that counts the votes or any other administrative or overhead payments, as well as post-election litigation.”Staff who appear to be working on the recount are the some of same who worked on Stein’s presidential campaign. Schwab, director of communications, made $3,840 in September 2017, according to the last available FEC filing. Campaign Manager David Cobb was also on the payroll as of September 2017, taking home a monthly salary of $7,520. Cobb announced the recount effort in a Facebook Live video and, in a subsequent video, identified himself as “Jill Stein’s campaign manager for the recount.” Cobb told The Daily Beast he is “still with the campaign,” but did not elaborate.In September 2017, Carl Romanelli, a former Green Party candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, was also paid $2,000 that month, plus $272.50 in travel, for “Recount Organizing Services,” according to the FEC filing. During the campaign, Romanelli worked as a “State Organizer” and “Field Organizer,” per reports filed with the FEC.As for the ongoing litigation that the Stein recount effort is supporting, not everyone is convinced it is meritorious. “I am not going to spend an ounce of thought on a legal challenge to an election two years ago when we have critical midterm elections in a few months,” said Neil Makhija, a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, when asked for comment. Makhija, who ran for public office in 2016 as a Democrat, argued that Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, also a Democrat, “is doing everything he can to update our systems to be secure and accurate.” But David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, says there is good reason to keep fighting. An expert on election security, he provided technical support and guidance during the initial recount effort.“It absolutely was not a Stein campaign cash grab,” he told The Daily Beast. And while examining voting machines and their source code may not change the result of the last election — Stein’s attorneys would quickly note they are not trying to — it could help secure the next one, Jefferson argued. It is about transparency.“To be perfectly clear, we never really had any evidence [of vote hacking],” he said. “The point we have always been making is that you have to look. You have to check. You don’t just accept the results of complex software, especially proprietary software. You don’t just trust it.”'},
 {'title': 'Jon Tester Has More on Ronny Jackson Than Has Been Made Public: Aides',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "For days now, President Donald Trump has been angrily tweeting at Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, for spreading wild allegations that fueled the implosion of the Veterans Affairs nomination of Ronny Jackson. But privately, relations are nearly as strained between the White House and the committee’s top Republican over what West Wing officials have described as the “smearing” of the White House physician.According to four sources familiar with the situation, both inside and outside of the West Wing, the Trump White House has grown increasingly angry with Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), the chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, for his apparent disinclination to warn administration officials in advance of Tester’s media blitz.Numerous congressional and Veterans Affairs sources told The Daily Beast that Tester was closely in touch with his Republican colleague throughout the last two weeks, when committee members first heard allegations against Jackson and began to investigate them. There was even an implicit understanding that Tester would be the one to address those allegations with the press as Isakson and other Republicans, while wary of getting into an intra-party feud, were nonetheless eager to send a critical message to the White House about its porous vetting operation. \xa0“They were trying to train Trump, but they didn’t have the balls to stand up to him,” said one top-ranking Democrat familiar with the plan. When the more brutal allegations against Jackson started coming to light—accusations of unprofessional late-night disturbances, drinking on the job, and wrecking a car—much of Trump’s senior staff was caught off-guard.This set off a barrage of angry phone calls from Trump’s team to Republican officials on Capitol Hill. The president’s public wrath has been directed at the Montana Democrat, who is up for reelection this year. “I know things about the senator I can say, too,” Trump said of Tester in remarks at a political rally on Saturday. “If I said them, he would never be elected again.”But there is no shortage of bitterness and distrust of Isakson among top brass in the West Wing. Senior White House officials began privately talking with each other about whether Isakson could have failed to aid or even warn Team Trump because the Republican chair was still sour after the president had abruptly nominated Jackson over the senator’s preferred contenders.Isakson, whose office did not return requests for comment as of publication time, has clashed with the West Wing over high-profile policy and personnel decisions at the VA, culminating in Jackson’s nomination this month. Isakson is close with VA Deputy Secretary Tom Bowman, the committee’s former staff director, whom he favored to take over for David Shulkin on an interim basis when the former VA chief was ousted in March. Instead, the White House tapped Undersecretary of Defense Robert Wilkie to serve as acting secretary while the Senate considered Jackson’s nomination, which ended in inglorious fashion this past week. The fallout of the failed Jackson bid has brought to the surface the remarkable tensions and delicate alliances that have come to define D.C. politics in the age of Trump.On the Hill, there is a sense of dismay over how poorly the process was handled. Much of the criticism has been directed at Trump’s team for cavalierly choosing a nominee with dubious credentials and asking lawmakers to, essentially, do the research usually done by the nominating body. Into that void has come confusion and chaos. It was committee Democrats who first heard rumors around Jackson a week and a half ago. They and the committee began investigating them over a five-day period, interviewing roughly 25 individuals. But, as things do on the Hill, word trickled out. And by Monday, some of the more salacious details were making their way into press reports. Some members of the committee say they were provided with little to no documentation supporting the allegations against Jackson. But those same members were also under the impression that Tester and Isakson were working hand in hand in gathering information on those allegations, even if that information wasn’t filtering down to more junior committee members. Isakson and Tester are exceptionally close, and pride themselves on the bipartisan reputation of the committee. Among other vignettes that illustrate their bond, it was noted that Tester recently taught Isakson how to take a selfie.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.That closeness was confirmed last Monday, when the committee announced it was delaying the Jackson confirmation hearing—a decision, numerous aides noted, that required Isakson’s assent.But then came Tester’s decision to go public with what the committee knew. Hill sources had different ideas about why the Montana Democrat chose to sit down NPR and CNN on Tuesday afternoon. One aide said “he got ahead of his skis.” Others suggested it was with Isakson’s consent and done, in part, because Isakson has kept a lower public profile as he deals with health-related matters that have affected his physical but not cognitive abilities. “Tester wouldn’t have done this without Isakson’s sign-off,” said one source who frequently works with committee members of both parties. On Saturday, a day after Jackson withdrew his nomination, Isakson’s office released a statement saying the senator “doesn’t have any issues” with how Tester had handled the matter. On Monday, Isakson again declined to distance himself from his colleague, telling reporters he is “not in the critiquing business.”While Trump has argued that his physician was maligned unfairly by Tester in particular, the White House was also informed, via Republicans on the committee, that more damaging information would potentially surface if they continued to push for a vote on Jackson. Tester’s office only included claims that it had double-or-triple sourced in its document on Jackson. Several aides confirmed there were other details they were set to try and track down but ultimately did not pursue. At least two aides suggested Tester would feel compelled to re-start research if the attacks by Trump persisted. Despite public denials from the Secret Service, among others, regarding allegations surrounding Jackson, CNN reported Monday evening that Vice President Mike Pence’s doctor had warned the White House last year that Jackson may have violated the medical privacy of the Karen Pence, the vice president’s wife.As for Jackson, he recently took time off with his family to determine if he even wants to stay on in the public eye as President Trump’s doctor. Multiple people close to him described him as being actively “disgusted” by the process since Trump officially nominated him.The blame for Jackson’s woes, however, may lie squarely with his current boss.“None, none, of this would have happened if the president and others hadn’t foregone an actual vetting process,” one senior White House official conceded. “[Ronny] would still have his reputation.”"},

John Appel\xa0prayedon February 6, 2006, “Purify our hearts and minds, that we may learn to renounce exploitation and prejudice in all its forms.”Each of these sentiments can be interpreted as anodyne or as controversial, depending on your point of view. Were they broadsides at elected leaders? Or calls to higher values that people of all parties have in common? You see what you want to see.After reviewing the archive of Conroy’s opening prayers, it’s clear that the overwhelming majority of them are inoffensive to the point of banality. “Lord, help them to know You. As ultimate truth, send Your spirit upon them, that You might find a dwelling place among them, so that all Your people can place trust in them as leaders as well as their representatives.” (July 24, 2017)“As Members of the people's House return to Washington, delayed by the storms that have blown through the Southeast, we ask Your blessing upon them that they might be all the more focused in their work.” (September 12, 2017)Meanwhile, what did Conroy really say in November that was so controversial?\xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

Of course, Democrats disagreed with that, but it’s not like Republicans proceeded on the platform of “you know what, let’s let the winners win as much as they want and screw the losers” – even if that was Ayn Rand’s philosophy.\xa0Likewise, Republicans as well as Democrats understand that there is vast inequality in America and that many people are suffering. That was a basic plank of Donald Trump’s campaign platform. They just say that big government makes that suffering worse, while lower taxes and spending lessen it.\xa0In other words, everything Rev. Conroy said, Republicans also said.No, this has to be something else.Since Republicans closed ranks around Ryan and quashed a move to obtain records of the matter, we may never know the truth. But if we look closer, this conflict reflects a\xa0much larger fight about Catholicism in America, with Conroy representing Pope Francis’s new progressive leadership, and Ryan representing the conservative old guard.Conroy isn’t just any Catholic, after all: he is a Jesuit, a sect that was once nearly banned by the Catholic Church and which has long been regarded as liberal, ecumenical, and, by some, heretical. Jesuits even feature in\xa0several conspiracy theories: they were blamed for the French Revolution and other political events, and were particularly hated in Germany, whom 19thcentury leaders and the Nazis blamed for undermining German values.“Conroy isn’t just any Catholic, after all: he is a Jesuit, a sect that was once nearly banned by the Catholic Church and which has long been regarded as liberal, ecumenical, and, by some, heretical.”Pope Francis becoming the first Jesuit pope was rightly understood as a revolution for the sect and the Church as a whole. And he has fulfilled many of the\xa0worst nightmares of conservatives,preaching a liberal economic gospel and even\xa0softening somewhat on women’s and LGBT issues, even while maintaining orthodox theological doctrines.\xa0For example, Pope Francis famously said to a reporter about gay people, “who am I to judge?” To which many conservatives would have replied:\xa0You’re the pope, it’s your job is to judge.But it is on economic matters that Pope Francis has most alienated conservatives like Ryan. Ryan is an avowed fan of the (atheist, anti-religious) Ayn Rand, who claimed that people ought to be as free as possible to better themselves, rather than be held back by the weakest. That means as little taxation as possible, as few health and environmental regulations as possible, as little government as possible.\xa0Pope Francis, on the other hand, has preached Jesus’s message of ministering to the “least of these.” He’s washed the feet of the poor, reached out to marginalized populations, and taken an\xa0extremely strong line on environmental issues, particularly climate change (which Ryan, in lockstep with the GOP, denies). Those positions lead to the diametrical opposite of everything Ryan stands for. And they represent the longtime liberalism (relatively speaking) of the Jesuits.That conflict, not a few borderline comments in a prayer, is what this fight is really about. It’s about the soul of American Catholicism, with Ryan and Conroy representing its conservative and liberal wings, respectively. Conroy is part of Pope Francis’s Jesuit-led movement, transforming the Catholic Church to the horror of conservatives. Ryan is one of the conservatives fighting back against it. This fight is a salvo in a much larger war."},
 {'title': 'How Close Is Donald Trump to a Psychiatric Breakdown?',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'With reports that a giddy commander in chief is running around the White House like a kid freed of any adult supervision, having dispatched every moderate who hasn’t resigned in hopes of saving a shred of his integrity, Donald Trump now appears to be in a state of mania as he escalates his efforts to bolster his fragile ego before he goes into the cage with special counsel Robert Mueller—or fires him. This was exactly what the contributors to the book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump warned about six months ago. The psychiatric professionals who contributed to the book have monitored and come to know Trump’s character better than most clients they have treated or people they have interviewed. As the special prosecutor’s noose tightens around the president and his cultish family, it is increasingly clear that he is an imminent danger to the public, and this impinges on professionals’ duty to society. Sheehy wrote about the book and its genesis in these pages last October (Sheehy and Sword also contributed to the book).Lawmakers with experience as prosecutors or foreign affairs experts are sounding red alerts about how far out of control is this tormented tweeter. In this White House it’s now every man for himself. As authors of the book warned, Trump trusts no one. Predictably, that has taught everyone who works for him that they can’t trust their boss. Praised today, fired tomorrow. The authors of the book warned that the Trump effect was creating a “malignant normalcy,” a collective psychological anesthesia in the face of people’s free-floating fears about the stability of this president. Last fall, it was the kind of hush that falls before an impending hurricane or an October Surprise. The book warned that the worst was ahead. Trump’s paranoia, exaggerated by the real and imminent threat of prosecution for obstruction of justice, money laundering, and physical intimidation of women he has bought for sexual pleasure, is reaching a break point. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal warns of a “catastrophic crisis” pitting an unhinged president against the rule of law and the future of democracy. “It’s an onrushing train heading straight at us,” warned Sen. Chris Coons this week. The Democrat from Delaware likely has inside knowledge from his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Even more ominous are the coded words of former CIA Director John Brennan, who this week told MSNBC that “perhaps the Russians have something” on Trump, and “Mr. Trump knows better than any one of us why the Russians might have something on him.” And this Sunday will bring the anticipated Stormy Daniels 60 Minutes segment. What will that do to this fragile man’s psyche? Her descriptions of Trumps pathetically “generic” sex play could strike the most wounding blow to his studly reputation. Our question: Will the president approach a psychiatric breakdown before, or after, he fires Mueller? One thing we are certain of is Trump’s extreme present hedonism—living in the moment. His decisions are made on impulse, driven by impulse, with no thought of future consequences or reflection on past mistakes. Unlike most of us who worry about the impact of our most controversial actions, Trump responds recklessly to assuage his ego needs. In an extreme present hedonist, attempts to bolster a fragile ego can lead to dehumanizing others in order to feel superior. We saw this in Trump’s humiliating dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his derision of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as he deprived the career civil servant of his pension. It’s all meant to cast them as “weak,” his favorite condemnation. Trump continues relentlessly to smear the most loyal of his appointees, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was first to publicly lie for him on the Russia probe, before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Inherently low in self-esteem, the extreme present hedonist will say or do anything at any time to self-aggrandize and shield himself from revelations of his nefarious activities.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don\'t).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

He unravels. He decompensates. His behavior may become manic. Another trait seen in the extreme-present hedonist is bullying. Trump displays a total lack of empathy and compassion, which leads to the aggressive bullying behavior that Mr. Trump has used to intimidate his rivals, rattle his advisers, and warn his Cabinet and congressional lawmakers of disloyalty. He uses bullying (along with payoffs) to silence his sexual playmates and victims of sexual aggression, as well as to insult women of stature like Oprah (branding her “insecure”). Oh, yes, and he loves to bully world leaders. Two days ago, he summarily replaced his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, with John Bolton, the former UN ambassador, whose white shrub of a mustache had previously turned off Trump as unable to pass the Apprentice star’s TV screen test. But only weeks ago, Bolton had told The Wall Street Journal he favors preemptive strikes against both North Korea and Iran. That suited Trump’s taste for war as the ultimate distraction from his troubles with the law. Bolton is a virtual twin of Trump in his extreme paranoia about the “deep state.” The prospect of Trump and Bolton, twin paranoids, running the foreign policy of the United States is a threat to the rest of the world. To verify the symptoms of mania, Sheehy sought out Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of psychiatry at Columbia University’s medical school and a former president of the American Psychiatric Association who has produced 10 books on mental illness and psychiatry. This conversation took place in the summer of 2016.“Manic personalities are imbued with a sense of self-importance, grandiosity, and mission,” Dr. Lieberman said, taking care to add that this is true of most people who seek the presidency. Granted, anyone with the audacity to assume that he or she has what it takes to lead the world’s superpower will exhibit an excess of narcissism and its offspring—a sense of entitlement—along with a grandiosity of ambition and some degree of messianic belief that she or he is the ideal rescuer-protector for the times. But early on, Donald Trump crashed through the sound barrier on all such temperamental traits. Dr. Lieberman elaborated on the fragmented thinking process of a person suffering from mania. They jump from subject to subject, not following a line of logical reasoning, no thematic consistency. They need less sleep, or don’t sleep at all.The average person doesn’t need a Ph.D. to peg Trump in ordinary words as “a raging, overbearing, egotistical, obnoxious boor,” as professor Lieberman observed. But what goes on in the brain of a manic temperament is more dangerous than just obnoxious. “There is a biochemical disturbance in a part of their brain that involves regulating moods,”\xa0Lieberman said. “Instead of being able to re-stabilize a highly emotional state, they remain in a period of excess. That state can persist for days, weeks, or even months.” This sounds like a dead ringer description of the state of Trump’s mind in recent months as he sleeps less and tweets more—up to as many as a dozen times a day—to create a perpetual disarray in government and a constant distraction from what he most fears.Before speaking further, the properly cautious Dr. Lieberman read me the Goldwater Rule, which cautions medical professionals not to comment clinically on people in the public domain without having personally treated them. This “rule” was created almost 50 years ago by a trade organization, the American Psychiatric Association (of which Lieberman is a past president) before the DSM manual of psychiatric diagnoses was published and long before the internet existed.Notwithstanding the above, when asked if he had ever seen or heard a candidate for the presidency who was as grandiose in stating his unique self-importance, he said: “Not [in] an American candidate.” Asked what world leaders might match Trump for mania, internationally or historically, he offered only two competitors: Italy’s hyper-narcissistic former president, Silvio Berlusconi, and the fascist Benito Mussolini. Two months after Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) tightened its rule to forbid psychiatrists from making any comment on any aspect of a public figure, even in an emergency; a de facto gag order. While much of America began speaking openly about the mental state of their president, the actual professionals in the field of psychiatry were prohibited from doing so because of the gag rule.The revolt of the shrinks against this rule began almost a year ago, in April of 2017. A normally apolitical Korean-American professor of law and psychiatry at Yale University, Dr. Bandy X. Lee, called a town meeting to debate the APA rule vs. the ethical duty of\xa0“witnessing professionals”\xa0to warn and protect America first. The Yale School of Medicine supported the conference, but Lee withdrew its name for her alma mater\'s protection. The expected audience shrank to fill a few scattered rows. Dr. Lee was addressing the APA\'s new "violation of free speech” by expanding the Goldwater Rule into a gag rule. Howard Covitz, a Philadelphia psychoanalyst and former director of the Institute for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, pointed out that the Goldwater Rule, as it now stands, has no limits. “Hypothetically, a president could be hallucinating and running on the White House lawn buck naked, screaming ‘Bring me my nuclear codes!’ and the new rule would continue to gag professionals from speaking up.” A dozen top psychiatrists engaged in debate and wound up with a clear majority in favor of going public with their concerns, despite the new rule. Yale’s Dr. Lee joined ranks with Harvard’s Dr. Judith Herman, both women believing that the Trump presidency rises to a historic turning point in the nation’s necessary response to an evident mental health crisis in the Oval Office.\xa0The key question, said Herman, “is whether mental health professionals are engaging in political collusion with state abuses of power, or in resistance to them.”\xa0Dr. Lee doubled down by recruiting 27 mental health professionals and commentators who agreed that the APA was colluding with the Trump White House to silence mental health professionals. St. Martin’s Press agreed to publish the book, and the authors took no compensation. With its debut on Amazon on Oct. 3, Dangerous Case shot to the top of that best seller list and within weeks appeared high on the best seller list of The New York Times Book Review. By November, a fusillade of attacks by Dr. Lieberman began to scare off the media. Ironically, it was Lieberman who denounced the book in the most disrespectful terms as “not a serious, scholarly, civic-minded work but simply tawdry, indulgent, fatuous, tabloid psychiatry.” While evidencing no hint of having read the book, he branded the authors as having made a “diagnosis” of Trump without personal examination, when they carefully address this issue in the book and explain why they are not breaking ethical guidelines. “Dangerousness” addresses the need for a psychiatric evaluation and is not a diagnosis; it is a human failing of serious concern in a leader. Meanwhile, Lieberman himself proposed a specific diagnosis of Trump in the popular magazine Vice.To this day, the APA has not reconsidered its gag rule, although some members have resigned in protest. This week has seen Trump go rogue in attacking Vice President Joe Biden as “crazy” and “weak,” his favorite projections on others of qualities he may fear in himself. Forget the psychiatrists for the moment. How do Trump’s extreme present hedonism, dehumanization, and bullying affect every day Americans? Sheehy jokingly suggested over a year ago that she and many others were suffering from TAD: Trump Anxiety Disorder. The American Psychological Association (i.e. not the American Psychiatric Association) has recently reported that the nation’s stress level is now worse than at any time in memory—worse than during World War II and Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. With mounting evidence of the president’s likely guilt of high crimes and/or lying about payoffs to silence his female accusers of sexual hedonism, we never know if we are out of the dystopian nightmare where the next tweet could be a nuke. Even if this president goes down, his normalization of clearly unacceptable behavior is the harbinger of a violent culture that will afflict our nation for at least another generation. Rosemary Sword is co-developer of Time Perspective therapy with psychologist Philip Zimbardo, Stanford professor emeritus and author of Stanford prison experiment.Gail Sheehy is a journalist and author of 17 books, including Passages and Character: America’s Search for Leadership. Correction: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this piece misidentified the professional organization that imposed the gag rule on psychiatric professionals. It is the American Psychiatric Association, not the American Psychological Association. The Beast regrets the error.'},
 {'title': 'Trump Administration Creates an Office of Discrimination',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Just over two months ago, Roger Severino, head of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime conservative activist, announced the creation of a new division to investigate claims of “religious discrimination” against doctors, pharmacists, and hospitals who deny services to people like me.Together with Severino’s announcement came a formal regulation designating the division’s new powers.\xa0Tuesday, March 27, was the last day for public comment, and an astounding 69,688 comments had been received as of Monday night.\xa0Unfortunately, as part of the hitherto-unprecedented practice of the Trump administration, those comments have been hidden from view, so we have no idea what they say.Here, however, is what I said in mine:As a columnist, professor of religion, attorney, and rabbi, I write to express my deep opposition to this proposed grant of power. I have studied the religious exemptions movement for many years, including the work of Mr. Severino himself, and wish to strongly object to this provision on political, constitutional, and moral grounds.First is the political irony of this massive grant of authority taking place during an administration supposedly opposed to the administrative state.\xa0This provision inflates the state's power, doing so on the side of those who seek to deny services to people with whom they disagree. It is dangerously wrongheaded.It is also insincere. Mr. Severino fought against abortion, homosexuality, and LGBTQ issues his entire life.\xa0To claim that this new action is actually about religious freedom is totally disingenuous.\xa0It is about the underlying rights and issues.\xa0He is of course entitled to his views, but to pretend they are about religious freedom when really they are about religious doctrine on sexuality is, simply, a lie.Why is it that “religious freedom” only comes into play when a woman or gay person is involved?\xa0Why is Mr. Severino’s office focused entirely on abortion?\xa0Is it really just a coincidence?\xa0This is politics, plain and simple.Second, these purported instances of religious discrimination are really about civil rights.\xa0I’m sure you know the history, but I’ll repeat it for those who don’t.\xa0For 20 years, the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of conscience ended where another person’s freedom began.\xa0All of us are free to worship, believe, and practice religion as we wish.\xa0But when my religion tells me to hurt you, there my freedom ends and yours begins.That was true until just four years ago, when the Supreme Court ruled that Hobby Lobby, a corporation, had a right to religious freedom, and could deny insurance coverage to women who might use it for contraception. Suddenly, the inviolable boundary line of “live and let live” was crossed.That was a shocking new development.\xa0And yet, I want to emphasize that people are harmed even when there’s another alternative available.Suppose a transgender friend of mine is traveling and needs emergency care.\xa0To her surprise, she’s denied treatment because the hospital chain, “as a matter of faith, moral conviction, or professional medical judgment, believes that maleness and femaleness are biological realities to be respected and affirmed, not altered or treated as diseases.” Those are Mr. Severino’s own words, from a paper he wrote when he was working for the DeVos family.Even if there’s another hospital next door, my friend has suffered “dignitary harm”—meaning her human dignity has been compromised.\xa0She’s probably also traumatized.\xa0Hanging a “No Gays Allowed” or “No Transgender Allowed” sign on the door, which President Trump says is perfectly OK and which this new office would ensure is perfectly okay, sends a clear message that people like my friend are not equal citizens of this country.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

In other words, they should follow the secular law.\xa0That is part of the social contract we all “sign” as citizens.\xa0When I enter into the marketplace—especially if I’m providing life-or-death health services—I obey its neutral laws, not my religion's specific strictures. The “religious exemptions” movement ignores Jesus’s teaching and says that Christians should be able to excuse themselves from laws. Jesus didn’t turn away Mary Magdalene, who seems to have had a morally dubious past.\xa0Jesus didn’t refuse to cure the faithful centurion’s “servant” even though, following Roman custom, the two were almost certainly in a same-sex relationship. In fact, Jesus didn’t turn away anyone, even when he radically disagreed with them.So why do we need a government office to protect those who disagree with Jesus so intensely that they turn away those whom he would welcome? Why are the “least of these,” those who are minorities in this country and seeking the same treatment as everybody else, now going to be attacked by a government office?Finally, this is personal.\xa0In addition to being a rabbi and professor, I am a happily married gay man with a baby daughter.\xa0Under this proposed rule, the Department of Health and Human Services will fight on the side of an emergency room that wishes to refuse to admit my daughter for treatment.\xa0That is dead wrong, morally as well as legally.Suppose my baby daughter gets sick one evening. We bring her to the nearest ER, but the doctors there say they won’t treat the child of a same-sex couple because they have moral objections.\xa0What are we supposed to do? You tell me.I know full well that this proposed rule will go through regardless of the 70,000 comments received, most of which I assume are against it.\xa0However, let it be known that many of us are watching, and maybe God is watching too. Your immoral and insincere actions will not be forgotten.\xa0Or forgiven. "},
 {'title': 'John Kelly’s Forgotten History Lessons',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "White House Chief of Staff John Kelly hails from the Brighton section of a Boston, whose 18th century grandees included a Yankee Protestant manufacturer who so detested Irish immigrants that he refused to hire them as servants at his estate.The full extent of David Nevins Sr.’s bigotry was subsequently noted by local historian William Marchione in the Allston-Brighton Tab newspaper.“When the roof of his handsome mansion sprung a leak, and he was unable to find a Yankee workman to repair it, he allowed the rain to pour in rather than employ and Irishman to make the necessary repairs,” Marchione wrote. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Marchione suggested that the psychology of the time is similar to the anti-immigrant sentiments being expressed in present days. He did not need to add that President Trump is the leading voice of intolerance, or that Kelly has come too close to echoing his boss. “The psychology of the period, it’s very similar to the Hispanic situation today,” Marchione did say.Then as now, there was a shortage of native-born workers willing to toil for low wages in onerous conditions. Nevins might have been willing to put up with a leaky roof, but losing money was something else and even bigotry such as his had limits. He was willing to hire the Irish—mainly women and children—to labor in his giant Pemberton Mill in Lawrence.Nevins and a business partner had purchased the five-story facility at auction during the financial panic of 1857 and crammed additional machines into it. The 800 workers—60 percent of them Irish—tended 2,700 spindles and 700 looms, generating 150,000 yards of cloth a week for an annual profit of $1.5 million, or $48 million in today’s dollars.In the late afternoon of Jan. 10, 1860, cast-iron columns in the building that were later found to have been defective buckled under the added weight. The structure suddenly collapsed, killing as many as 167 workers.“The scene after the fall was one of indescribable horror,” the Boston Globe reported. “Hundreds of men, women, and children were buried in the ruins. Some assured their friends that they were uninjured, but imprisoned by the timbers upon and about them. Others were dying and dead.”The account continued, “Every nerve was strained to relieve the poor unfortunates, when, sad to relate, a lantern broke and set fire to the wreck. In a few moments the ruins were a sheet of flames. Fourteen are known to have been burned to death in the sight of their loved ones, who were powerless to aid them.”A woman who had already lost her husband and a daughter in the Great Famine back in Ireland lost a second daughter to what would become known as the Pemberton Disaster. A Lawrence official later recounted the fate of a 15-year-old orphan who had been working for 50 cents per 10-hour shift to support her younger siblings.“We had nearly extracted her; ten minutes more and she would have been saved,” the official reported. “But the flames came.”Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet.

The onetime estate of the Irish-hating grandee became home to Saint Gabriel monastery and Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital.“Two Catholic institutions,” the historian Marchione noted last week.One would hope that Kelly was unaware of the history of his own home turf when he made his comments about immigration NPR last week. He started out promisingly, allowing that “the vast majority of the people that move illegally into United States are not bad people.” He then turned nativist.“But they’re also not people that would easily assimilate into the United States into our modern society,” he said. “They’re overwhelmingly rural people in the countries they come from—fourth-, fifth-, sixth-grade educations are kind of the norm. They don’t speak English; obviously that’s a big thing. They don’t speak English. They don’t integrate well; they don’t have skills.”Two researchers with genealogical skills, Monica Pattangall and Jennifer Mendelsohn, were prompted to post details of Kelly’s roots on Twitter. Kelly proved to be the great-grandson of 19th century immigrants from Ireland and rural Italy. They appear to have been largely rural people.Kelly’s paternal great-grandparents were both of Irish extraction. One paternal great-grandfather was a blacksmith, the other a railroad worker. His maternal great-grandparents were of Italian extraction. One maternal great-grandfather, John DeMarco, is listed in 1900 U.S. Census records as a day laborer who still did not speak English 18 years after coming to America. He did speak English by the time of the 1930 census, which recorded him as working as a fruit peddler in his late seventies, but not yet a citizen. His wife, Crescenza DeMarco, still had a “No” in the “Speaks English” category 37 years after her arrival.For a considerable time in Brighton and elsewhere, the Italian immigrants were subjected to bigotry not just by the Yankees, but also by the Irish immigrants who had suffered the same from the likes of Nevins.“They were discriminated against by both,” Marchione told The Daily Beast.One symbol of social progress and true American greatness came with the marriage of postal worker John Kelly and Josephine Padalino, granddaughter of the DeMarcos. The joining of a Kelly and a Padalino produced a son also named John, who joined the Marines and rose to four-star general and is now the White House chief of staff.The John Kelly who has risen to such prominence should always speak as the great-grandson of immigrants. Kelly instead sounds too much like that long-ago grandee in a Brighton mansion, not to mention the present president in the White House."},
 {'title': 'How Guaranteeing Jobs Became the Hot New Policy Priority for 2020 Dems',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "In his State of the Union address in 1944, Franklin Roosevelt made the case that the government had a role to play in ensuring that every American who wanted a job should and could have one. The vision was never achieved. But some 74 years later, it has become the hot new policy touchstone for progressive Democrats rumored to be running for president. On Wednesday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) jumped to the vanguard of those lawmakers pushing the federal-job-guarantee initiative when his office formally introduced a bill on the matter. And according to a source directly familiar with the legislation, Booker will have four powerful co-sponsors on his bill: Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Separately, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has already broadly outlined his own approach to a federal jobs guarantee.That possible 2020 Democrats seem eager to associate themselves with a relic of the FDR era is a remarkable reflection of the progressive lurch the party has taken in the Donald Trump era. It also is a victory for a group of relatively obscure economists and academics who have, for years, been championing the concept that every able-bodied American who wants a job could and should have one at a non-poverty wage and with benefits. Darrick Hamilton, professor of economics and urban policy at The New School is one of those academics. He has published work alongside Mark Paul and Dr. William Darity Jr., both of Duke University, arguing for a federal jobs guarantee, analyzing the racial wealth gap and discussing policies to achieve full employment for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He has advocated these points for years. But it was only in 2017 and 2018, that lawmakers began to truly listen—compelled to do so, Hamilton surmised, because of the election of Donald Trump. “I think that it is the case that the Trump election, perhaps there’s a silver lining, that the status quo is not working and that the American people are ready for change and the Democrats are beginning to hone in and provide not just change but something that is substantive so we really can have an inclusive economy,” Hamilton said. Suddenly, Hamilton had an audience on the Hill. He said he and others have been in touch with the offices of Sanders and Booker advising them on how to best shape this policy and introduce it to the public. “They have certainly been in conversation with us,” Hamilton told The Daily Beast. “This is a movement that we are really engaged in, but it’s the culmination of the work of a lot of people,” he added. “The policy makers in D.C. are in touch with that and incorporating it into their proposals.”In addition to the work of Hamilton, Darity and Paul, Stephanie Kelton, a professor of public policy and economics at Stony Brook University, has also taken a leading role in pushing the federal jobs guarantee initiative. Kelton, who previously served as chief economist on the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and as a senior economic adviser to Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, authored a research project about a path to full employment earlier this year. And she, Darity and Hamilton met with Sanders and his team on February 8 to discuss the idea. She viewed the renewed enthusiasm for the issue not as a radical deviation from Democratic norms but as a return to the principles of FDR’s Second Bill of Rights.“We have had a significant departure from the party for many many years from where it once was and I think people have become in a sense accustomed to that lower bar and now when someone comes and suggests upping the bar, it seems radical I suppose,” she said.Politicians have pushed smaller versions of this approach before only for it to be undone in the legislative process or dismissed entirely. The Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, which was signed into law by President Carter in 1978 and pushed by Coretta Scott King\xa0after her husband’s assassination, sought to provide a jobs guarantee and set unemployment goals for each successive president to reach. Early iterations of the bill created a federal Job Guarantee Office but that was cut from the legislation.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.In 1988, Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign platform called for providing jobs to every American via a new Works Progress Administration type program, which was a New Deal agency. The 2018 edition of this push seems more ambitious, if only because of the number of establishment candidates who appear drawn to the proposal. A similar proposal—guaranteed income—received a far cooler reception, with former Vice President Joe Biden, slamming it as inherently discouraging of actual work. And, on the Hill, lawmakers seem keenly interested in actually having their name attached to specific legislative language that is closely associated with putting people to work and tackling cyclical unemployment. Booker’s bill, first reported by Vox, would create a pilot program for a federal jobs guarantee initiative in up to 15 high-unemployment communities throughout the United States. It would create a three-year program in those communities ensuring that every adult living there can have a guaranteed job which will “include a minimum wage phasing in to $15/hour, paid family and sick leave, and health coverage like that enjoyed by Members of Congress.” There are no concrete cost evaluations at this time but an estimate from experts published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put it at $543 billion per year. As for Sanders, a draft outline of his bill, shared with The Daily Beast and first reported by The Washington Post, indicates that it could be much more expansive than what Booker is proposing. It would create a federal job guarantee with three categories of job and job training opportunities. To implement the jobs programs, Sanders proposes that the preexisting 2,500 American Job Centers around the country be used. In addition, there would be 12 regional offices and advisory boards to carry out projects and coordinate with a new national office within the Department of Labor. Workers would be hired and paid a minimum wage of $15 an hour and full-time employees would receive health care benefits equivalent to other federal employees. For the purpose of oversight, the Sanders bill would catalog the status of the projects on a website and would create a Division of Progress Investigation to monitor potential waste and abuse. On Tuesday, Sarah Treuhaft, senior director of the PolicyLink, a progressive research and advocacy organization, said that the organization had a conversation with Booker’s staff. She, along with Hamilton, Darity Jr. and Angela Glover Blackwell who founded PolicyLink, authored a set of ten principles for a federal job guarantee which were sent to Booker’s office. For people like her, no matter how the policy ends up taking shape, it’s a positive sign that the conversation is even happening at all. “I think that the political environment that we’re in is demanding bolder policy solutions to these long entrenched issues around racial inequities in the labor market,” Treuhaft told The Daily Beast describing the current moment. “There’s a hunger from communities for real solutions that produce tangible results.”"},

  'body': "Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) is taking heat for some possible campaign-finance violations.The Federal Election Commission on Wednesday sent a letter to Nunes’ campaign committee, raising red flags about some particular contributions received in 2017. The letter, sent to Nunes’ campaign treasurer and mother Toni Dian Nunes, requested “information essential to full public disclosure” about three potentially illegal contributions.A total of $3,000 was contributed to Nunes’ campaign fund by Harris Lee Cohen, whose FEC contribution information lists him as the manager of “SIFI,” or Setton International Foods, Inc. in Terra Bella, CA. According to their website, Cohen is the general manager of Setton Pistachio. Cohen contributed $1,500 in July 2017, and again in November. FEC reports also show that Joshua Setton, listed as the President/CEO of Setton Farms in Terra Bella, contributed a total of $16,700 towards Nunes’ campaign committee and victory fund.$3,000 was also contributed to Nunes from Jeffrey J. Kimbell, president of a Washington lobbying firm specializing in “legislative, regulatory and policy solutions to clients in the life sciences community,” according to their website. Kimbell’s FEC contribution information lists him as a self-employed “health care consultant” in his June contribution of $1,000 and his two December contributions of $1,700 and $300.According to ProPublica, Kimbell’s firm lobbied on behalf of clients Acadian Ambulance and Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Services on bills like the Ambulance Medicare Budget and Operations Act of 2017, introduced in July, and the Comprehensive Operations, Sustainability, and Transport Act of 2017, introduced in September. Both bills were sponsored by Nunes.Both Kimbell’s and Cohen’s contributions violate FEC limits, prohibiting “an individual…[from making] contribution(s) to a candidate for federal office in excess of $2,700 per election.”An additional $10,000 was also contributed last November by Stone Land Company, a “family farming operation” operating near Nunes’ California district. The company sent an undated letter to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Bay Delta office pushing for a “reliable water supply” in the state and that it repair “California's broken water system.”Stone Land Company’s money to the Nunes campaign violates the FEC rule that forbids contributions “from corporations and labor organizations unless made from separate segregated funds established by the corporations and labor organizations.”Nunes has until April 24 to respond to the FEC."},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Maybe it was the extra cackle when Andrew Cuomo told me he doesn’t read Glamour.Or maybe when he said luring the well-regarded MTA chairman back into the transit post required that he “tugged” on parts of his anatomy.Or maybe it’s all the gratuitous political noogies he unleashes on Mayor de Blasio—but add it all up, and people are starting to think that maybe Andrew Cuomo is so rattled by Cynthia Nixon that it could cost him this whole governor thing.“Everything just sort of seems off,” agreed Christina Greer, a professor of political science at Fordham who is now a McSilver Institute fellow at NYU. “In the one-month rollout since Cynthia Nixon, there just seems to be so many rookie mistakes from Cuomo and his camp,” which she noted is even more striking given that Andrew has been involved in politics “since he was 17” and his father Mario was running for governor.Here’s a recap of the backstory along with requisite caveats and only-in-New York explanations: Less than a year after alternating roles with Laura Linney in Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes, Nixon, who is also a longtime education activist, is poised to get the Working Families Party (WFP) line—and is seen as a credible, if long-shot contender for the Democratic line. The primary is Thursday, Sept. 13; four years ago college professor Zephyr Teachout got 34 percent of the vote. A recent analysis finds if turnout is similarly low and Nixon replicates Teachout’s share, she’d only need to peel away 75,000 votes from the governor.Our state politics is often a dreary affair—embodied by the dark labyrinth that is the state capitol in Albany. Cuomo isn’t unpopular among Democrats but Cynthia Nixon is breathing newness into what’s been an endless winter. It’s not just her celebrity, but also her ability to disparage the governor without losing the twinkle in her eye. Add in Cuomo’s woundedness, and you think maybe she has a shot, especially when she is directing angry progressives to channel pent-up hunger into toppling Cuomo, whom she says is cut from the same cloth as Donald Trump’s oversized overcoat.And then.There are a number of reasons why a Governor Nixon—or even Democratic nominee Nixon—is hard to see. (Though I think New Yorkers and lovers of democracy everywhere should cheer her simply being in the race, because democracy demands choices.)First of all, is Cuomo really Trump? Her team says yes, because of their supposedly shared support for “massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich”—a claim the indispensable Politifact labels “mostly false.” Apart from XY chromosomes and a Queens accent, the Trump-Cuomo linkage seems to be campaign hyperbole. Cuomo is by New York standards temperamentally a fiscally moderate and socially moderate-to-liberal Democrat who more than anything is moved by his adept reading of prevailing political winds.There are more reasons why she is a long shot. Teachout had advantages four years ago that Cuomo has rectified (banning fracking and reaching a detente with teachers’ unions, for instance). Cuomo also has all the advantages of incumbency—and in recent weeks has cheered many on the left by, among other things, reuniting state Senate Democrats and restoring voting rights to parolees.Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.“Cynthia Nixon is going to have Andrew Cuomo wearing a Black Lives Matter hoodie in a couple of weeks,” Greer jokes, echoing a punchline from New York political circles recently.At the same time, despite deep pockets of liberals, New York’s Democratic primary is not as uniform as some may think, as longtime Democratic consultant Bruce Gyory notes. Nor is corruption seen as a major voting catalyst. (Cuomo isn’t facing charges, but a top aide was recently convicted, and another high-ranking state official soon faces trial). And the governor’s got $30 million in campaign cash to spend—plus the support of the get-out-the vote troops in the state party and supportive unions. (We don’t yet know how much Nixon has raised.)There’s also the fear factor. Wow, this governor scares—or tries to scare—people.Stung by the WFP’s support of his rival, Cuomo’s campaign cajoled unions to bolt the party, denying the WFP a major revenue source. Then, he mused that community groups who back Nixon—some of whom help undocumented immigrants or people facing eviction—can “lose my number,” according to reporting from my NY1 colleague Zack Fink.Asked if he was punishing them, Cuomo replied: “I am not going to punish—it has nothing to do with me. Punishment is for God.”Good heavens.Where this could get really nasty is at the state Democratic convention next month, where the party will officially endorse Cuomo (Nixon can get on the ballot for September’s primary in other ways). Even though he has a challenger, Cuomo controls the state party. It’s the kind of cozy arrangement we saw two years ago nationally that prompted Bernie Sanders supporters to decry the Democratic apparatus as rigged—jeering at Hillary Clinton’s convention in Philadelphia.Since then, progressives have amped up their attempt to remold the party from within, including internally in New York. It likely won’t be enough to deprive Cuomo of requisite support, but watch for steam coming out of his ears if there are boos and catcalls at his fiesta. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s failure in February to crack 40 percent of party faithful in California is an extreme, if unlikely, example of what could befall Cuomo. Cuomo’s team knows it may not be pretty.“There’s always chaos and shenanigans at conventions, so I expect nothing less from my Democrats come convention time,” said Jefrey Pollock, Cuomo’s pollster.Pollock, who has been advising Democrats locally and nationally for years, argues that in this chaotic Trump era, Democrats are hungry for experience—“steady hands.” Then, in an interview, he echoed a controversial talking point about Cuomo being akin to progressive hero Bernie Sanders. He noted Sanders has “been in Washington for a long time.”“When you think about Bernie Sanders as a candidate—even though he was an outsider rhetorically he had decades of government experience,” Pollock told me. “People who were excited about him also saw that he had the capacity to be a steady hand in government because he knew government.”A few days earlier, Cuomo’s spokeswoman said the senator and Cuomo (who have appeared together) are in “lock step,” prompting Ari Rabin-Havt, senior adviser to the senator, to tweet: “The idea that Andrew Cuomo and Bernie Sanders are lock step on policy is 100% Grade A American bullshit.” Sanders isn’t expected to endorse in the primary, but that isn’t stopping Nixon from offering herself to his supporters. “Voters want an authentic candidate and in a Democratic primary, they want someone who is authentically progressive. Andrew Cuomo is not,” senior adviser Rebecca Katz told me.Nixon is enjoying a month of flattering, and shallow, national media attention; voters should soon demand she specifically outline the tradeoffs and politicking required to fulfill her ambitious agenda. In the meantime, fitfully, and, frankly weirdly, Cuomo is adjusting—warning a split party increases chances of a Republican governor, and tacking left to deny her political oxygen. Nixon’s candidacy also seems to be unleashing (or coinciding with) action elsewhere: Thursday Sen. Charles Schumer announced he wanted to decriminalize marijuana—even signing a bong. Nixon is no doubt pleased at her quick effect—but she’s after the top job. And while her background is an unusual springboard for statewide office, she could look across the aisle, and country, for inspiration: Ronald Reagan had a far less celebrated acting career before he unseated an incumbent governor seeking a third term in California. That was in 1966, a few months after Cynthia Nixon was born."},
 {'title': 'Jake Tapper Presses Paul Ryan on Trump Support: This ‘Must Be Embarrassing’',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared Wednesday afternoon on CNN to discuss his premature retirement from Congress. But first, The Lead anchor Jake Tapper just had to ask him for his take on the latest cloud of scandal surrounding President Donald Trump. “This must bother you,” Tapper told Ryan. “Access Hollywood, Stormy Daniels, Karen McDougal, at a certain point it must be embarrassing.” As he has done before, Ryan claimed not to have even read the recent New York Times report regarding the FBI raid of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s office, though, he added, he’s “obviously familiar” with the situation. “We’re pretty focused on getting our work done here and so this is something that I’ll let you guys speculate about. Right now, I’m busy trying to get things done in Congress. We have a big agenda and that is where my focus is and I don’t have much punditry to offer you on this.”Ryan did, however, have some advice for Trump. “I just think the way president ought to handle this is compartmentalize it and focus on doing your job,” he said.As for why the 48-year-old one-time Republican vice-presidential nominee and current No. 2 in the line of succession should Trump end up leaving office early suddenly decided on an early retirement, Ryan pushed back on the notion that it had anything to do with the increasing likelihood that the GOP will lose its control of the House in November. “Actually, I really don’t believe that, that’s not true,” Ryan said. “Because we have an excellent track record to run on.” He added that one of the reasons he was “comfortable” stepping aside is that he’s “confident we could keep the majority” in the House. Two years ago, Ryan called Trump’s comments about a Mexican-American judge the “textbook definition of racism.” But even on his way out of Congress, he had nothing negative to say about the president who helped him achieve his dream of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. “We’re very different people,” Ryan said of himself and Trump. “We had a lot of friction in our relationship, but what we learned is that we have a common agenda to agree on and we want to get it done and it will make a difference in people’s lives and that is what we were elected to do.” Tapper ended the interview by asking Ryan about his political future. The speaker said he had no plans to run for president or any other higher office, but added a caveat: “Not while my kids are growing up.” He insisted, “Right now, the last thing I’m thinking about is running for something.” “I believe that, but we’ll see,” Tapper responded, reminding Ryan that his children are teenagers and will be “out of the house soon enough” '},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "As the American political world watched to see which Stacey would make the cut in Georgia’s gubernatorial Democratic primary, an equally interesting story unfolded down ballot. Diverse, enthusiastically progressive women and men were making a move all across the Georgia ballot in what most of the country has written off as the ruby red, conservative South. White Democratic men, however, did not fare well. \xa0Those voters pulling Democratic ballots in Georgia’s open primary have shown they strongly prefer elected leaders that look like them, and with few exceptions that is not older, white men.  The pairing of Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans sharply contrasted with the five white, conservative men running in the Republican gubernatorial primary who participated in embarrassing debates about who has the bigger pick-up truck, chainsaw, gun and deportation bus. One Republican candidate’s commercial featured him pointing a shotgun at a would-be suitor of his daughter, reminiscent of 1960’s Andy Griffith Show’s fictional feud between “Pa” Darling and crazed mountain man Ernest T. Bass over the fair Charlene Darling.Abrams and Evans left nothing on the bench - pulling heavy-hitter endorsements, raising major cash, running truly substantive ads and engaging in serious debate about serious issues they expected the voters to understand, and the voters did. \xa0In the end, Abrams beat Evans with over 75 percent of the vote, winning not just in the urban and suburban precincts, but in rural counties, as well.  A superb orator, Abrams topped the night with a rousing speech that sought to connect all of us – urban and rural alike – to the notion of one prosperity. \xa0Evans immediately conceded and joined ranks.Abrams goes on from here to try and make history as the first female African-American Governor in America. She will have two months to make hay while the sun shines, as the Republicans engage in what will certainly be a bitter run-off, to be held on July 24. Republican voters were deeply divided between long-time Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, who garnered a disappointing 39 percent of the primary vote, and Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who mustered 26 percent. \xa0“Let's assign the vast majority of Georgia’s white male support, let’s say 30 percent of the vote, to whomever makes it out of the Republican run-off. That leaves 70 percent of the vote (comprised mostly of women and non-white males) up for grabs.”Note, however, that Cagle did his best to make an archenemy out of the third-place finisher Hunter Hill. Now, Hill may well team up with Kemp. Both Kemp and Hill are more conservative than Cagle, which should bode well for Kemp in a July vote that is certain to have low turnout and attract only the most ardent, right wing voters. Regardless of who wins, we can probably go ahead and assign the vast majority of Georgia’s white male support, let’s say 30 percent of the vote, to whomever makes it out of the Republican run-off. That leaves 70 percent of the vote (comprised mostly of women and non-white males) up for grabs.What is interesting and thus far largely unnoticed, is that Abrams and Evans were not alone in making Georgia Democratic history. \xa0There were solid women candidates all over the Democratic primary ballot.  In a state where no woman currently holds statewide elected office, we had two Democratic women running for Governor, two running for Lieutenant Governor, one running for Secretary of State, two running for Insurance Commissioner, and two running for Georgia’s highly visible and controversial Public Service Commission. Three out of six Democratic candidates for the 7th congressional district were women: one of whom, Carolyn Bourdeaux, is well-funded, brilliant and tough. \xa0She will be in the July run-off with Democrat David Kim, the American-born son of Korean immigrants, a Harvard graduate and entrepreneur. \xa0In other words, both candidates are strong and stand a good chance to upset Republican incumbent Rob Woodall in November. The Cook rating for the district is R+9, meaning that it is Republican but winnable for a Democrat in a strong year.Democrat Lucy McBath was the top vote getter out of a field of men vying for the opportunity to face 6th district Republican Congresswoman Karen Handel (the victor in last year’s Jon Osseff match-up). McBath will face Democrat Kevin Abel, a South African immigrant and successful entrepreneur, in the July run-off. \xa0Either candidate will give Handel a run for her money in the general election.  This district is R+8, according to Cook.In Georgia’s 180-member House of Representatives, 34 Democratic women saddled up to compete for seats previously held by Republicans. This is on the heels of Georgians electing the first two Latina and the first Vietnamese woman state representatives, joining other African-American and white women elected to the state legislature in 2016 and 2017.The table is set. Georgia Republicans usually out-vote Georgia Democrats in primaries by about 290,000 votes. This time around, it was 50,000. If that enthusiasm gap continues into November, the statewide races will be neck and neck. \xa0And, much like Amy McGrath’s Kentucky primary defeat of Democratic Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, we see Georgia Democratic voters choosing diverse, qualified candidates, particularly women, to do battle in November.  These candidates are thought to be more pragmatic, than dogmatic. \xa0They don’t measure truck size, and they vow to check their egos for the shared purpose of solution making. Maybe these Southern Democrats have stumbled on to something.  "},
 {'title': 'CIA Discrimination Against Disabled Officers Is Hurting the U.S.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "I grinned as the taxi raced through the busy streets of a bustling Middle Eastern city in the middle of the night with my 200-lb. electric wheelchair strapped to the back with bungee cords. There were moments like this throughout my 10-year career as a CIA officer that reminded me how incredible it was that I had made it to the agency as a woman with a disability. I had always wanted to work for the CIA, having been long intrigued by its mission to accomplish what others cannot accomplish and to go where others cannot go. I learned quickly, however, that that creative, can-do spirit of the agency did not extend to employees with disabilities.Through a series of national security legislation, the CIA is exempt from doing things it decides would jeopardize national security. On disability issues, they wear those exemptions as both sword and shield—something I watched play out throughout my entire career.My first job there as an intelligence analyst was everything I hoped it would be—exciting, fast-paced, and important, covering issues I loved but had only ever studied in text books. However, there was not an accessible restroom near my office and it took six months for the agency to install an automatic door opener for me. Each time I went in and out of the office, I had to ring the doorbell for someone to open the door. I had been warned on my very first day that my reputation mattered almost more than anything else in the tight-knit agency community and I worried that my dependence on other people would quickly label me a nuisance.\xa0The few fellow employees with disabilities I met in those early days confirmed my fear, warning me that I needed to downplay my very visible disability if I did not want it to affect what we at CIA call my “hall file.” Best to ask for as little help as possible, they advised, or else be seen as a problem-child. This became a theme in my career. I could either speak up or have a successful career, but not both.\xa0I had a goal of rising quickly through the ranks. I was one of only a handful of female military analysts and I threw myself into the job with every ounce of energy I had, even as my health suffered for it. An international crisis began almost as soon as I started and my boss did not even hesitate before throwing me right into the middle of covering it, which is exactly where I wanted to be. But as the crisis dragged on and the early mornings and late nights did not stop, my disability fought back. I was in constant pain. I needed a break. Fresh out of graduate school, I was worried if I spoke up, my boss would think I was weak and take me out of the center of activity when all I really needed was the same thing an able-bodied person would need, a break in the schedule to rest.While I could—rightly or wrongly—downplay my disability, I could not ignore the lack of equal access employees with disabilities faced every day. I watched people unable to contribute their best because of barriers at work. People with hidden disabilities often had managers who did not believe they had a disability simply because they couldn’t see it. Others needed treatment for mental health issues, such as PTSD, but were reluctant to seek treatment in case it would jeopardize their security clearances. Colleagues who became disabled mid-career discovered very quickly the harsh reality of the lack of resources and support available to employees. These people had to manage not just figuring out how to live with a disability in their personal life, but how to continue doing their jobs without adequate support from the organization to which they had devoted their lives.\xa0Early on in my career, I volunteered to be the chair of the CIA’s employee resource group for people with disabilities, a position I retained for most of my career on top of my regular day job. I developed a strategic plan to improve conditions for employees with disabilities, built a network of allies across the agency, and set about briefing our proposed solutions to senior leaders. I was convinced that if I did things in the proper way, using official channels, presenting a business case for greater inclusion and accessibility, the agency would have no choice but to do the right thing.I was wrong. Most of those meetings, I felt like I was on trial. “Why does it matter if someone in a wheelchair can’t access one of our buildings overseas? They just won’t go there, then,” one senior asked me in a particularly tense meeting. I would swallow back my anger and explain that it was how to best protect our country and preventing a regional expert with a disability from working in their region of expertise was not the way to do it. Other times, I’d schedule a meeting with a senior, only to show up to a room full of lawyers with their agency-approved talking points on why they were not legally obligated to make certain accommodations for employees with disabilities.\xa0It is not that the agency could not do more. It was choosing not to and armed itself with lawyers to defend that choice. One CIA lawyer early on in my career warned me privately that his office was there to protect the agency from employees, not the employees from the agency. He gave me an apologetic look and sent me on my way.\xa0Despite this, my career moved rapidly upward. In fact, I made it in to the senior ranks faster than anyone else I ever worked with in my 10-year career. I served as an intelligence briefer to the White House and later, became a manager in the Directorate of Analysis, where analysts produce intelligence assessments and briefings to inform policymakers, to include the president, on global events. But I know much of my success was because for most of my career, I downplayed my disability and only ever requested what were considered easier accommodations, like having the height of my desk adjusted. But over and over again those early warnings I had received about the consequences of being “too vocal” proved true for some of my colleagues with disabilities. For those who spoke up too loudly or went around the chain of command to fight back when they did not receive appropriate accommodations, their careers went stagnant. None of them were asking for anything special—simply that the agency remove the barriers that prevented them from doing their jobs.Like in many places in the private sector, there’s a culture of “everyone is replaceable” that is at the core of personnel management at CIA—and no more so than in how its managers its employees with disabilities. It’s a questionable practice for an agency that prides itself on hiring the “best and the brightest” in the country and spends thousands of dollars on security clearances and training just to bring them in. Like the rest of its officers, people with disabilities work all across the CIA in everything from intelligence collection to support for operations. Some colleagues with disabilities went to work very successfully at other government agencies or in the private sector where they were given the accommodations they could not get at CIA. They could have been successful at the CIA, too, in a way that contributed to national security if they had only received the right tools.As a lifelong disability rights advocate, at different points in my career I had to stop and ask myself if I could continue to work for an organization that so openly discriminates.\xa0Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.The turning point came half-way through my career. I was selected for one of the more high-profile overseas positions to a country I had been to and worked in many times before. I was months away from deploying, when an official from another organization who ultimately had the final say rejected my deployment. It took years to get the official to admit it was because I was in a wheelchair. To be clear, I was not medically disqualified and I was chosen because I was the most qualified person for the job. I considered legal action, but was told quite candidly by several seniors at CIA that I would jeopardize our relationship with that organization if I did. Later, in a meeting with the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, I was warned that the “7th floor” would probably decide not to help me if I insisted on “stirring the pot.”\xa0I didn’t want to stir the pot. I simply wanted to be able to do the job for which I was selected, like everyone else. In the years since, I have learned that agency seniors did little more than politely ask the other organization to reconsider their position. I was never allowed to fulfill my assignment.In 2013, CIA Director John Brennan commissioned the Diversity in Leadership Study (DLS) to identify the barriers employees from diverse backgrounds face at the agency. It was no surprise to any of us living through it that the study found employees with disabilities face significant roadblocks at every stage of employment at CIA—recruitment, retention, advancement, and career development. As the study noted, “The underrepresentation of… officers with a disability at the senior ranks is not a recent problem and speaks to unresolved cultural, organizational, and unconscious bias issues.” After the study, Director Brennan made a public pledge that the agency would become the Employer of Choice for people with disabilities.Even when the study was released in 2014, however, its findings were still regarded with skepticism by many, and it only led to cosmetic changes to CIA’s inclusion efforts.\xa0Any progress we might have made on disability issues at CIA took a major step back with the new administration. I was in a meeting with members of the CIA’s 7th floor even before Brennan was replaced with Mike Pompeo, discussing a proposal to increase investment in assistive technology for employees who are blind in a way that would make technology accessibility a permanent reality. Agency Information Technology systems are highly customized, which means standard software, such as screen readers for people who are blind/low-vision, are not naturally compatible and must be altered. The funding we proposed was a mere drop in the bucket for the agency and yet, seniors were pushing back.\xa0Why fix it now, one senior argued, when technology 10 years down the road will fix all our problems anyway? That was not the worst statement made in that meeting. Toward the end, one of the CIA’s most senior leaders said that perhaps it was time to admit the agency just couldn’t have blind employees. I was floored.\xa0The officers we were talking about worked in different parts of the CIA—from operations to analysis. Some of them had critical language capabilities we needed. Others had caught terrorists and many were talented and experienced intelligence briefers. Most of them had multiple degrees from some of our best universities. A few of them had served in the military before losing their vision and all of them had years of CIA experience and skills needed to protect our country that she was suggesting we should simply throw away. Her proposal wouldn’t just close the door on them, it would close the door to highly skilled new hires and on anyone who could lose their vision at any time in their career, including herself.There was a reasonable solution that would accommodate current and future employees, a solution the CIA could afford simply by canceling a few holiday parties. We were talking about losing highly skilled employees simply because the CIA did not want to go to the effort of accommodating them. After I got over my initial shock, I asked her about Director Brennan’s pledge to make the CIA an employer of choice for people with disabilities—a pledge she herself had repeated to me personally before.\xa0“That was always more of an aspiration than an actual plan,” she said. The new administration had not even come into office yet, and already we were taking a step back.I was there at Mike Pompeo’s first meeting with CIA employees in which he became visibly angry when multiple employees asked him to continue Brennan’s diversity and inclusion. “We’ll hire the best people, okay? What do you want me to say?” he huffed.I was not willing to go backwards. I resigned from the CIA about six months later.\xa0Since I have left, I am told routinely by former colleagues with disabilities who are still there that the circumstances remain the same. They are regularly denied opportunities and given inadequate resources to do their job, and their careers are suffering for it. As of my writing this article, another talented colleague with a disability has decided to leave the CIA.I loved my career and I was good at my job. I know that my work helped protect our country and resigning was the hardest decision I have ever made in my life, but I could not stay and continue to watch blatant discrimination play out day-after-day. The men and women with disabilities who show up every day to protect our country, despite the barriers the agency actively places in front of them, are some of the most dedicated public servants in government, and this country needs them and their expertise.\xa0"},

The U.S. Green Party candidate revealed Monday that she had doled out more than $365,000 since the end of September 2017. As of April 30, 2018, her campaign had just over $761,000 in cash on hand. The June 4 filings, first noted by Dave Levinthal of the Center for Public Integrity, are the first Federal Election Commission reports offered by Stein’s campaign in the last seven months. They come following a Daily Beast investigation that revealed that Stein was likely violating federal campaign-finance laws by keeping her campaign finances hidden. "The delay in our latest filing is due to the fact that we have had to revise our reports as a routine part of the audit process that automatically follows the use of clean money public campaign finance matching funds," Stein campaign communications director Dave Schwab said in a statement. "This is a difficult, labor-intensive process that has taken our compliance team months of work to prepare."Stein had raised $7.3 million for swing-state recounts and had hinted that donors would have the ability to vote on how she would spend any leftover money. But those recount efforts came to an end in December 2016 and no votes have been offered. Instead, since then, the Stein campaign has pursued recount-related litigation in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, seeking to access the source code of electronic voting machines. Most of the money spent in the past several months has been on lawyers and filing fees. But money has also been used to keep Stein’s 2016 core campaign staff intact.According to the new disclosures, Stein campaign manager David Cobb was paid $7,520 in April 2018, 19 months after the 2016 election. Cobb has described his current role as “campaign manager for the recount.” Matthew Kozlowsi, the Stein campaign director of compliance, was paid $7,160 in April 2018, according to the most recent data. That compares to a monthly salary of $3,000 in April 2016 in the midst of the actual presidential campaign.Schwab earned $3,840 in April 2018, compared to $3,400 in April 2016. Last week, however, he told The Daily Beast that the Stein campaign remains committed to allowing its donors a chance to vote on how to spend whatever money remains, once litigation has ended.UPDATE: After publication of this piece, Cobb sent over the following statement: I am serving in several roles. I oversee the campaign audit, a routine FEC cross check on campaigns that have qualified for clean money public matching funds that typically spans a period of time long after the campaign has ended. As an attorney and former sponsor of the 2004 presidential recount that led to significant victories for election integrity in Ohio and New Mexico, I also coordinate with the attorneys for much of the ongoing legal work being done on behalf of the recount.'},

  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'National Security Adviser Herbert Raymond McMaster is the newest member of Washington’s fastest-growing social club: former Trump White House officials. McMaster, a Lieutenant General in the United States Army and a veteran of three wars, is the latest in a recent string of casualties in an administration that has seen the departure of numerous senior officials—a purge that comes a mere five months after Trump mused that his cabinet amounted to “one of the finest group of people ever assembled.”“I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor,” President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday. “I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.”Shortly after the president announced that he would be replaced by former U.N. ambassador and noted hyper-interventionist John Bolton, McMaster announced that he plans to retire from the U.S. Army this summer.“After thirty-four years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service,” McMaster said in a statement, noting that he was “thankful” Trump for his time as national security adviser. McMaster is the president’s second national security adviser—the first, Michael Flynn, resigned after a mere 24 days following revelations regarding undisclosed contact he had made with Russian government officials and has since pleaded guilty to perjury. His exit follows months of tensions between McMaster and the president. McMaster had been a vocal advocate on behalf of the Iran nuclear deal, a lonely position to take in the Trump administration.McMaster had been rumored to be on the outs with President Trump for months, most recently due to public comments calling evidence of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election “incontrovertible.” The remarks prompted a swift reaction from the Trump on Twitter:But a primary obstacle to McMaster’s continued employment was reportedly his staunch defense of the Iranian nuclear deal, which directly conflicted with Trump’s promises, extending back to the presidential campaign, to kill the agreement. Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired via Twitter on March 13, was another proponent of staying in the deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for imposing limitations on the nation’s nuclear ambitions.Trump had campaigned against the Iran deal, telling pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC that his “number one priority” as president would be “to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,” but as national security adviser, McMaster met with top senators on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January to help protect the agreement. McMaster’s public disagreements with the president and his staff on the Iran deal and Russia might have been anticipated, had President Trump read McMaster’s Ph.D. dissertation. Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, The Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies that Led to Vietnam, which was eventually published as a popular book, criticized the Joint Chiefs of Staff for deferring to President Lyndon Johnson’s wishes regarding U.S. strategy in Vietnam rather than provide counsel that conflicted with the president’s ego.“Through their own actions,” McMaster wrote in the book, “the Chiefs… always found themselves in the difficult position of questioning a policy that the president had already approved.”'},
 {'title': 'I Got Pills from Ronny Jackson. But That’s Not the Part I Regret.',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "“Without warning or explanation, a member of the medical team entered and began handing out sleeping pills like candy.” That’s a sentence from my recent memoir, Thanks, Obama, describing an overnight trip to Germany in 2015. I thought I was setting up a harmless story about trying and failing to undress discreetly in the coat closet of Air Force One. I never dreamed I was writing about a future would-be cabinet secretary, one whose nomination flamed out in dramatic and public fashion.Yet here we are. In addition to being the pill hander-outer from my anecdote, Ronny Jackson was the personal physician to Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. And, up until Thursday morning, he was also the latter’s nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. To my surprise, passing around prescription drugs is one of several allegations that sunk his nomination. Back when I was reclining in my leather seat in the Air Force One staff cabin, a small ziploc baggie clutched in my outstretched hand, my greatest concern about sleeping pills was that they could leave me drowsy if POTUS wanted to go over his speech the next morning. I never thought I was witnessing potentially scandalous behavior. In some ways, I still don’t. Even in retrospect, the sleeping pill dispensing doesn’t seem like that big a deal. Presidential staffers are expected to hop between time zones without missing a beat. If anything, on my sole foreign trip as a presidential speechwriter, having a Navy doctor pass out sleeping aids added to the quasi-military sense of mission that animated Air Force One. It was the same patriotic thrill I got the first time a flight attendant justified the ludicrously high-calorie meal by telling me “An army marches on its stomach.” As White House staffers, we were supposed to conk out on command and awake ready to flawlessly execute. I actually regret not taking a pill (it was cold; I slept badly) but I don’t regret being handed one. It didn’t make me feel sketched out. It made me feel special. In retrospect, that’s how all my interactions with Dr. Jackson felt. There weren’t too many of them – a passing greeting on the plane, maybe some small talk backstage at an event – but each one left me feeling included. I was part of a small, secret club. Coming from someone in regular contact with POTUS, someone whose military bearing left me both intimidated and impressed, even a simple nod of recognition could be enough to add swagger to my step. I knew my colleagues’ encounters with the doc were similarly swagger-inducing. Which is why, a few hours after President Trump nominated him, I confidently tweeted that Ronny Jackson was “a decent guy.”That’s the piece of writing I now regret. Far more disturbing than a few stray Lunesta, in my opinion, are the accusations that have emerged from the White House Medical Unit which Dr. Jackson oversaw. “The most unethical person I have ever worked with.” “Toxic.” “Abusive.” “Volatile.” “Vindictive.” “Belittling.” “The worst leader I have ever worked for.” These are not descriptions of a decent guy. Are they accurate? Is Ronny Jackson the upbeat backslapper from my experience or the borderline psycho from anonymous reports? I’ll say now what I should have said weeks ago: I don’t really know.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.Looking back, I don’t wonder how I could have been so wrong about the president’s doctor. What I wonder is how I could have been so confident about him. Why did I mistake my brief glimpses of a man for the full picture of his character? Why was I so convinced my positive impression was correct? That’s the nature of sycophancy. The “kiss up, kick down” attitude that defines countless horrible bosses, especially in politics, is surprisingly hard to spot—and that’s especially true when you’re on the receiving end of the attention. For one thing, it didn’t occur to me that in my own, middle-of-the-org chart way, having a White House job made me worth sucking up too. I knew that plenty of people in Washington kiss ass to get ahead. I just never imagined my ass might be the one getting kissed. If I’m being honest, however, I also have to admit that part of me must have welcomed the special treatment. When it’s someone else being fawned over, toadyism is obvious and obnoxious. When you’re the one on the receiving end of the fawning, however, it feels less like fakery than confirmation. Why, yes, I am indeed extremely wonderful. Thank you for noticing. Three years after accepting my pill baggie, I now think of my story as a warning, not about the dangers of pharmaceuticals but of flattery. Those of us hoping to wield power—even power of the modest and/or make-the-world-better variety—would do well to avoid my mistakes. Don’t confuse charm with character. Don’t assume you’re too unimportant to garner sycophants’ attention, or too savvy to succumb to their appeal. Don’t underestimate how difficult it is to find people willing to tell you no. And don’t forget that if these things aren’t easy for mid-level White House staffers, they must be near-impossibly hard for presidents. Which brings us to the current one. President Trump isn’t merely susceptible to flattery. He requires it. Just witness his cabinet meetings, where heads of federal agencies compete to out-grovel each other on camera. Or his bilateral press conferences, where heads of state have discovered that Trump-era diplomacy is mostly about praising Donald Trump. And let’s not ignore the fact that Ronny Jackson’s most well-known public moment until now came when he almost certainly lied about the president’s height and weight. The main reason he was tapped run the VA, in other words, was his willingness to humiliate himself to stroke the ego of the Commander-in-Chief.A talent for flattering the powerful might be considered a qualification in the Trump White House. But as we’ve been reminded this week, it’s all too often paired with a disregard for everyone else. Is Ronny Jackson a good person? I no longer pretend to have an answer to that question. But I do know I’m glad he won’t be running the VA. \xa0"},
 {'title': 'Primary Preview: What To Watch For In Indiana, West Virginia and Ohio',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': 'There are a number of high-stakes contests taking place throughout in four states on Tuesday, primaries that will have major ramifications on the success of both parties this year. Voters in West Virginia will choose a Republican Senate candidate to challenge incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). The top three contenders are Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-WV), Attorney General Patrick Morrissey and former coal executive Don Blankenship. Blankenship, a former coal executive who went to federal prison for conspiring to violate mine safety standards after 29 miners were killed in an explosion at a mine his company owned, appears to have gained momentum in recent days through a scorched-earth racist campaign aimed at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). \xa0On Monday, President Trump tweeted a plea for voters to reject Blankenship, not because of his past but rather that he would not be viable in a general election matchup. Blankenship dismissed the tweet and later criticized Trump for recommending “that people vote for a guy that was basically accused of pedophilia in Alabama,” a reference to Judge Roy Moore who lost a Senate race in Alabama last year after being accused of sexual misconduct with a number of minors. In Indiana, Republicans are similarly eyeing the opportunity to knock off an incumbent, Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN). Viewed as one of the more endangered Democratic members of the Senate, he could face off against Rep. Luke Messer (R-IN), Rep. Todd Rokita (R-IN) or former state lawmaker Mike Braun. The contest has largely hinged on the candidates trying to be as supportive of Trump as possible, with Rokita recently running an ad promising to bring special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe to an end if elected. Ohio is playing host to high-profile primaries for both the Democratic and Republican parties. There are a total of ten Republicans vying for Rep. Pat Tiberi’s (R-OH) vacated seat in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District, creating a kind of proxy war between moderate and more conservative Republicans. State Senator Troy Balderson has the backing of Tiberi while another challenger in the race, Melanie Leneghan, has the support of House Freedom Caucus co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Air Force veteran Tim Kane, who has described himself as an “old-school, free-market economist,” is also gaining attention, yet running behind Balderson and Leneghan. Another interesting dynamic is unfolding in the Democratic primary for governor in Ohio. Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and former U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, are viewed as the top two competitors in the contest. Recent polling has indicated that the wonkish Cordray, described affectionately by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as a “nerd,” has a healthy lead over Kucinich despite a high number of undecided voters. Both are progressives with a key distinction being Cordray’s prior A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, a point which Kucinich has emphasized. Cordray now believes in universal background checks. Kucinich made headlines recently for taking $20,000 from a pro Syrian government group, which he did not initially disclose when he gave a series of speeches in 2017. '},
 {'title': 'Trump Just Jeopardized America’s Biggest Asset in the Syria War, U.S. Officials Say',
  'sub_title': 'filler',
  'body': "Donald Trump’s outbursts this week about getting U.S. troops out of Syria have done substantial damage to Washington’s influence over its crucial Syrian ally, knowledgeable current and former senior administration officials and service members tell The Daily Beast. That influence, they believe, is America’s most important asset as it navigates one of the world’s most chaotic and transactional battlefields. “Everyone is tracking U.S. politics, particularly Trump, way better than we think,” a member of the American special-operations community told The Daily Beast. “It’s hard when you make assurances, your chain of command makes assurances, and then all of a sudden the president comes off the top rope and changes things.”Although Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats assured reporters that a “decision” was reached at a critical Tuesday meeting of the National Security Council on the future course of the U.S. in Syria, officials tell The Daily Beast that much remains unresolved and in flux. That irresolution lingers even after Trump’s top advisers issued a public reminder that the war against the so-called Islamic State, upon which all U.S. policy in Syria is predicated, remains unfinished. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders—not Trump himself—issued a statement later that morning that walked back any talk of withdrawal, but also clearly hinted at Trump’s impatience. It was an uncertain denouement that followed six days in which the U.S. changed its Syria posture substantially, yet adjusted its 2,000-troop force posture not at all. At least not for now. Current and former administration officials familiar with the internal Syria policy debates believe that the key to determining whether the damage is lasting or manageable will be whether the mostly Kurdish ground proxy force on which the U.S. overwhelmingly relies to fight the Islamic State, the SDF, starts hedging its bets.The officials see no coincidence that adversaries Russia and Iran, with whom NATO ally Turkey bandwagoned, this week broadcast a showing of unity and resolve—one that isolated the U.S. from what they portrayed as the relevant diplomatic process.Trump’s indecision occurs even as the 2,000 U.S. forces are physically digging in, out of preparation for a long stay, as both The Daily Beast and the New York Times reported Thursday, on territory its SDF allies hold. Whatever assurance of U.S. commitment that provided comes as operations against ISIS have substantially slowed, as the Pentagon acknowledged Thursday, with the Kurds swarming to the northwest to fight the invading Turks. If the SDF sees the U.S. equivocating in its sponsorship, it can choose to fight a whole different war—one to secure an autonomous region for itself. “We just lost a bunch of leverage with the SDF. They're probably going to start planning on a U.S. withdrawal, because how could they not?”— Former senior administration official“We just lost a bunch of leverage with the SDF,” said a former senior administration official. “The SDF is probably going to start planning on a U.S. withdrawal, because how could they not?” Multiple senior officials told The Daily Beast there is unanimity among Trump’s advisers against a set withdrawal timetable, something CNN and the Washington Post reported that Trump desires. There is also unanimity against taking any hasty or unilateral decisions. Still, one official cautioned against an oversimplification that the national security apparatus sees its priority as managing Trump while managing Syria. The outgoing national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, did not attend the Syria NSC meeting, spokesman Michael Anton said, with Deputy National Security Adviser Rick Waddell serving as the senior NSC representative. Last summer, McMaster convinced Trump to reverse himself on withdrawing from Afghanistan, at a cost to his relationship with the president. It is unclear whether incoming National Security Adviser John Bolton will urge Trump to remain in Syria or reinforce Trump’s instincts to leave. Last Wednesday, the Trump administration’s policy on Syria remained the one most clearly expressed by former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. It also amounted to a declaration of mission creep—and may have contributed to Trump’s recent fury over Syria. Although Washington initially committed to a policy of regime change in Syria, the Obama and Trump administrations have said since the U.S. first placed troops in Syria in 2015 that the mission was exclusively to fight ISIS. Any effect on the broader civil war was, officials have consistently maintained, indirect at best. (A lonely exception, separate from the ISIS war, was Trump’s abrupt April 2017 missile strikes on a Syrian airstrip to retaliate for the Bashar al-Assad regime’s chemical-weapons attack; later attacks were met with no such reprisal.)Get The Beast In Your Inbox!Daily DigestStart and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.Cheat SheetA speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).By clicking “Subscribe,” you agree to have read the Terms\xa0of\xa0Use and Privacy\xa0PolicySubscribeThank You!You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet. We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.But in a January speech, Tillerson changed that. Now, not only was the U.S. ground presence necessary to prevent a resurgence of ISIS; it might also involve checking pervasive Iranian influence, though Tillerson didn’t come out and commit the military to fighting Iran and its proxies. If that wasn’t enough, the U.S. presence would have the benefit, Tillerson argued, of bolstering U.S. leverage to help shape a political solution to the endless Syrian civil war. All this would require an “indefinite” U.S. presence, without any additional resources. It added to the morass of the 2018-era U.S. approach to Syria. Administration officials noticed that Tillerson expansively redefined U.S. policy objectives in a brutal, multifaceted foreign war without adding any resources. But it had what some officials considered a benefit: the reassurance to allies, and message to adversaries, that a previously equivocal Washington eyed staying in Syria, albeit with a murky purpose. It spoke to a fundamental asymmetry on the battlefield. The goals of all other Syria combatants are comparatively clear. Assad wants to retain power. Patrons Russia and Iran want to aid him and accordingly bolster their own positions in the region. The Syrian Kurds want, at the least, something like an autonomous enclave. Turkey wants to prevent that. And each of those objectives is vastly more valuable to each actor than the U.S. presence is to Washington. In February, as Turkey fought the Kurds in Afrin, Tillerson pledged $200 million toward “stabilization” efforts for post-ISIS Syria at a coalition conference in Kuwait. That pledge, by an official whose job was very publicly in jeopardy, appears to have incensed Trump as a commitment Tillerson had no right to make. Tillerson received, on March 13, a humiliating sacking—though the $200 million pledge was nowhere near the driving factor after a relationship that had turned toxic long ago. \xa0After settling Tillerson, Trump turned last week to eviscerating Tillerson’s framework, which one senior official noted is the only option decisively foreclosed to the U.S. after this week’s upheaval. On Thursday, at a rally, the president railed against the U.S. presence in Syria as a waste. He pledged to get out “very soon,” sounding notes more akin to his campaign style. “Let the other people take care of it now.” Trump’s vocal insistence on withdrawing from Syria took the U.S.’ largely Kurdish ground force by surprise. And it drew confusion inside and outside the administration. Trump had made a far larger indefinite troop commitment to Afghanistan, a war with less of a relationship to U.S. security interests than the ISIS fight, and rarely spoke of it again. As well, Trump had for years assailed Obama for withdrawing from Iraq in 2011. (Though Trump also launched the opposite criticism.)One of them was Ilan Goldenberg, a former senior Middle East official in the Obama administration’s Pentagon and State Department. Following the mid-2000s’ public debate over the Iraq occupation, Goldenberg came into the administration in 2009 as an advocate of prompt withdrawal. Goldenberg now retrospectively considers that withdrawal “a mistake,” he said, and expressed bewilderment that Trump would consider a sequel—this time, with an eager partner, not the Iraqi parliament that rejected a residual U.S. force—and after withdrawal provided a new lease on life to the terror group that would become ISIS.“It’s insane,” Goldenberg, now with the Center for a New American Security, told The Daily Beast. “There’s no one who supports [abrupt withdrawal] in the mainstream, absolutely zero support across the foreign policy spectrum.” Goldenberg added: “He’s gonna do it, eventually.”Ahead of a National Security Council meeting on the future course of Syria on Tuesday, Trump’s disagreements with his senior military and diplomatic advisers exploded into public view.During a forum in Foggy Bottom, the senior U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Gen. Joe Votel, and the State Department special representative for fighting ISIS, Ambassador Brett McGurk, said that the U.S. had not fully defeated ISIS yet. They emphasized the coming need for reconstruction missions, to allow Syrian displaced persons to return to areas taken back from ISIS, and the delicacy of managing warring allies on a highly transactional battlefield. All this hard work, including military work, would be necessary for a durable defeat to ISIS, they indicated.“The hard part, I think, is in front of us,” Votel said. Almost simultaneously, Trump intensified his rhetoric about leaving Syria. “It is time. We were very successful against ISIS. We’ll be successful against anybody militarily, but sometimes it is time to come back home. And we’re thinking about that very seriously,” the president said. Press secretary Sanders’ statement, late the following morning, indicated that the U.S. would see the ISIS mission through, but indicated that the issue was unresolved. It pledged to consult with “allies and friends” ahead of any “future plans.” It tossed in a Trumpian nod “expect[ing]” those partners to share the burden. It was a morass, but aides were relieved that the morass signaled little immediate change in policy. “I’ve heard rumors of people talking about withdrawal. I know the president said ‘very soon,’ because we have been very successful in defeating ISIS, but it’s not over.”— Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Dana WhiteIf the statement did the minimum to clarify the durability of the U.S. in Syria, its principal adversaries—and even an ally bandwagoning with them—placed maximum pressure on Washington. On Wednesday, Russia and Iran were joined by Turkey, which has opposed Russia and Assad in Syria, in rejecting “new realities on the ground under the pretext of combating terrorism”—meaning a U.S.-backed Kurdish enclave. Despite all having deployed forces to Syria, the three emphasized “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria as well as the national security of the neighboring countries.” Left unsaid was that they, and not the U.S., were the relevant foreign powers in Syria. \xa0The emerging Turkey-Russia-Iran bloc speaks to a structural weakness in the U.S. position that the current muddle conceals. Once the U.S. and its mostly Kurdish allies—whom Ankara consider a terrorist group—take territory from ISIS, the Kurds control it, since the U.S. has vowed not to cede it to Assad. That creates a de facto Kurdish autonomous region—precisely what the Turks, with their own restive Kurdish minority, vow not to tolerate. In February, after ordering Turkish forces to take Afrin from the Kurds, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan thundered at the U.S.: “You were supposed to be our friends. What kind of friendship is this?” Finishing the war against ISIS amounts to more Kurdish control over Syrian territory, thus intensifying the Washington-Ankara divide; leaving it unfinished provides ISIS yet another chance at regeneration. According to CNN, the senior U.S. military officer, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, asked Trump what he wanted in Syria, and Trump told them he wanted ISIS defeated within months. Conspicuously, Trump last summer cheered his own Afghanistan policy for rejecting what he considered the artificial deadlines of the Obama era. \xa0If anything can be salvaged from Trump’s vacillations, officials hope, it might be additional financial sponsorship from the Gulf states. Trump on Tuesday called out Saudi Arabia as “going to have to pay” for an extended U.S. presence it desires. The remark came barely two weeks after Trump hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year old heir apparent who has cultivated Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Reportedly, Trump believes he reached a deal in December for Saudi King Salman to float the U.S. $4 billion for its role in Syria, and aides consider him conspicuously fixated on the issue. It is considered unlikely that the Saudis will stake Trump for $4 billion. But if Riyadh and other coalition allies open their wallets, it would give Trump a face-saving way to remain in Syria, the thinking goes.At the Pentagon on Thursday, spokespersons Dana White appeared to deny that Trump had actually talked about withdrawal at all, and denied any “miscommunication” between the Pentagon and the White House. “I’ve heard rumors of people talking about withdrawal. I know the president said ‘very soon,’ because we have been very successful in defeating ISIS, but it’s not over,” White said. Both she and a colleague, Lt. Gen. Frank McKenzie, evaded questions about a U.S. military role in post-conflict stabilization. They conspicuously evaded saying how they defined mission accomplishment against ISIS, the apparent starter-pistol for a U.S. withdrawal—when ISIS loses its last yard of territory? After a lasting form of post-ISIS normalcy settles?But they indicated, in a manner reflecting the president’s week of upheaval, that it was properly considered someone else’s problem. “As you look to long-term stabilization,” McKenzie said, “we should actually look to partners and allies in the region that are gonna be able to do many of those things.” "},

  'body': "As you’ve probably heard, President Donald Trump has fired Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, replacing him with his personal physician, Ronny Jackson—the White House doctor who went out of his way a while back to tell us how amazingly healthy the president is. Regardless of Jackson’s qualifications (he’s a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy who was also President Obama’s White House physician), this is yet another reminder of a president who likes to elevate friends and loyalists to important roles. Dan Scavino started off as Trump’s golf caddy, and ended up an assistant to the president. Hope Hicks did PR for Ivanka’s fashion line before becoming White House communications director. At one point, Trump put his personal pilot on the shortlist to head the Federal Aviation Administration. And I don’t think I need to reiterate the fact that Trump’s advisers also include his daughter and son-in-law. Call it the family business, relying on trusted loyalists, or rank nepotism, but this preference for the familiar goes on in other domains all the time. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel employs several family members and childhood friends to manage his show. Former Fox News boss Roger Ailes, I’m told, used to put his personal doctors and lawyers on TV as experts. I’m not sure this is ever a great idea (remember how\xa0Uncle Billy nearly ruined George Bailey’s business in It’s a Wonderful Life?). But at the presidential level, it strikes me as especially dubious. “It’s yet another example of how Donald Trump is seeking to purge his cabinet of independent thinkers, and surround himself with “yes” men.”I shouldn’t have to remind anybody of the potential ramifications. One could argue that the beginning of the end of the George W. Bush presidency was the mishandling of Hurricane Katrina. Michael Brown, the then-head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had very little experience in emergency services, but was personal friends with the then-FEMA head, Joe Allbaugh.The last thing we need is to risk another “You’re doing a heckuva job, Brownie” moment in the V.A. Haven’t these poor veterans been through enough already?Trump likes to govern from the gut, but his hiring decisions of late seem to cut against what might have been a strength for him—his promise to “hire the best” people. The problem is the way Trump defines “the best.” It’s not people who have experience or expertise—qualities that might cause someone to occasionally think for themselves. It’s trusted loyalists. This is yet another example of Banana Republican, not small-r republican governance. And it’s yet another example of how Donald Trump is seeking to purge his cabinet of independent thinkers, and surround himself with “yes” men who have demonstrated a willingness to play ball in this new world order. This is clearly a trend that we had better get used to. Personally, I can’t wait until Dr. Harold Bornstein takes Ronny Jackson’s old job as White House physician. Season 3 is gonna be lit. What does this say about Trump's long-standing attempts to portray himself as a friend of veterans? Giving a complicated, scandal-plagued agency over to man who may be a good doctor but has no experience in managing government bureaucracy seems risky.\xa0And what damage might this do to conservatism? We may want to prove that privatization of government functions provides cost-savings and efficient administration, but if Trump makes the VA another grifting opportunity for his friends, that plays into the hands of the big government left."}]
