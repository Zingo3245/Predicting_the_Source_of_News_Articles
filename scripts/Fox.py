Britain has been rocked by an epidemic of child sex scandals perpetuated by gangs of predominantly Muslim men.\nFox News reported Friday that he had been jailed for 13 months for contempt of court, but British media initially were unable to report on the sentence due to a reporting ban slapped on the case by the judge. That ban was lifted Tuesday after appeals by media outlets.\n\nRobinson, the former leader of the English Defense League known for his acerbic criticism of Islam, reportedly pleaded guilty to breaching the terms of a previously suspended sentence from 2017 when he reported on a similar case.\nRobinson is a polarizing figure in the U.K. Supporters say he speaks out against political correctness and the growing influence of Islamic extremism, while opponents claim he is a racist who stokes fear and division, and note that he has previous convictions.\nA counterterror police official said Robinson\'s material was partially responsible for the radicalization of a man who committed a terrorist attack on a mosque last year.\n\n\n\nThe details of the case Robinson was reporting on last week are still blocked by a reporting ban. Consequently many British media outlets reported only that he was arrested outside a courthouse, but gave no specifics about the case itself. However, Robinson’s supporters say he repeated allegations that have been published in local media outlets.\nRobinson’s jailing has tapped into a long-standing narrative among conservatives in the U.K. and Europe that authorities are quick to clamp down on anyone bringing attention to crimes associated with Islam, while being lax about the perpetrators of those crimes.\nConsequently, as news trickled out over the weekend, conservative figures reacted with fury. On Saturday, crowds descended outside Downing Street to demonstrate for Robinson’s release.\nOthers expressed concern for Robinson’s welfare, suggesting that due to his profile as an Islam critic, he may be a target in prison. U.K. Independence Party leader Gerard Batten said that one of the party’s members of the House of Lords wrote to Home Secretary Sajid Javid threatening a private prosecution as “an accessory, or for misconduct in public office."\n\nTommy Robinson latest: UKIP Peer Malcolm Lord Pearson has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid today saying : if Tommy is murdered or injured in prison he and others will mount a private prosecution against Mr Javid as an accessory, or for misconduct in public office. pic.twitter.com/UMkXqBVLoR— Gerard Batten MEP (@GerardBattenMEP) May 27, 2018\n\n\nQuickly, the case picked up international attention. Trump Jr. responded to a tweet about the case and the gag order, saying it was “Reason #1776 for the original #Brexit.”\n\nReason #1776 for the original #brexit. Don’t let America follow in those footsteps. https://t.co/6QLejT61i4— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) May 27, 2018\n\n\n“Don’t let America follow in those footsteps,” he warned.\nIn Europe, reaction was also strong, particularly among those who have opposed what they see as the Islamization of the continent.\nRight-wing Dutch MP Geert Wilders submitted parliamentary questions to the Dutch minister of foreign affairs on the matter, and on Monday called the jailing "a disgrace."\n"The lights of freedom are going out," he said in a statement in front of the British Embassy in The Hague.\n\nMy statement in front of the British Embassy in The Hague today.Free Tommy Robinson!Restore Freedom Of Speech!#TommyRobinson #FreedomOfSpeech #FreeTommy pic.twitter.com/VLq0Xo6xWq— Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) May 28, 2018\n\n\nGerman MP Petr Bystron, who represents the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), told Breitbart London that he is pushing the German government to allow Robinson to claim asylum, and deemed him a “political prisoner.”\n“We’ve seen there has been a high level of opposition throughout Europe against this act. So we said, ‘Okay now society is reacting but we need not only banners, not only stickers but something else, something real,\'” he told the outlet.\nSupporters of Robinson set up a Change.org petition, which by Tuesday afternoon had picked up more than 481,000 signatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

However, rampant political bias is inappropriate for a widely used public forum,” the letter says.\xa0 \n“What’s more, the consequences to our democratic society are profound. That is why special attention is necessary to address issues such as Facebook’s use of liberal organizations to fact-check content, the access to user profiles it gives to some employees, and Twitter’s manipulation of content that appears for the site’s users.” \n\nWe won’t tolerate bias toward conservatives or @realDonaldTrump supporters. We’re standing up for you and demanding answers. @GOPChairwoman and I have sent the following letter to @facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and @Twitter’s @jack Dorsey. #StopTheBias pic.twitter.com/Poz0Dne9i7— Brad Parscale (@parscale) May 24, 2018\n\n\nZuckerberg defended his site in front of a hearing on Capitol Hill last month, and last week in the European Parliament -- while addressing concerns about bias as well as security and privacy. In D.C., he admitted that such concerns were understandable as Silicon Valley “is an extremely left-leaning place."\n\n\n\n"This is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company is making sure that we don\'t have any bias in the work that we do," he told Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.\xa0 \nThe letter cites voices such as pro-Trump personalities Diamond and Silk, who say they have been blocked by Facebook, and calls for the giants to be transparent about what they are doing. It also says that Facebook is working to encourage voter registration, but expresses concerns that “the new feature does not become essentially an in-kind contribution to liberal candidates.”\nFacebook did not respond for a request for comment by Fox News, while Twitter declined to comment. \nIn his first TV interview since becoming Trump’s campaign manager, Parscale said on Fox & Friends that he receives thousands of messages from people saying they have been censored.\n“We want to ask them for transparency, I think the public deserves that transparency and we need to know that conservative voices have the chance to get their message out,” he said. “This is a big problem.”\nHe said that on Facebook, algorithm changes have led to a decrease in reach by as much as 40 percent. \n“We need to make sure that conservative ideas and principles are allowed on these social-media platforms and there’s not a thought police coming from Silicon Valley,” McDaniel said. \n\xa0\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

The ban was a virtual death sentence for ZTE, which relies on U.S. parts.\nThe Trump administration, though, caused controversy by putting ZTE in play amid trade negotiations.\n\nAccording to Trump, Xi recently called him to ask if there was something he could do to put the company back in business. Trump asked Xi what he was prepared to do, the president said -- and Xi replied that he was willing to have ZTE pay a fine of $500 million dollars for the embargo violations, change the management and replace the board. Trump countered with a fine of $1.5 billion, the management and board swaps, security guarantees and a guarantee that ZTE would buy a large percentage of its parts from U.S. companies, he said.\nAfter further negotiations, they settled at a $1.3 billion fine, according to the president.\nTrump told Fox News his handling of ZTE shows that he is prepared to be tough on China and Chinese companies when they misbehave.\xa0\n\n\n\n“ZTE – I shut it down,” Trump told Fox News. “Obama didn’t punish ZTE. I shut it down.”\nTrump said Xi told him tens of thousands of people would lose their jobs if the U.S. continued to refuse to sell parts to ZTE.\xa0 Xi told Trump many of those jobs were in his hometown.\nThe Commerce Department also informed officials on Capitol Hill on Friday that a deal has been reached.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, blasted the potential deal on Friday.\n“If the administration goes through with this reported deal, President Trump would be helping make China great again,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Simply a fine and changing board members would not protect America’s economic or national security, and would be a huge victory for President Xi, and a dramatic retreat by President Trump. Both parties in Congress should come together to stop this deal in its tracks.”\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio also came out against it, calling it a "great deal... for #ZTE & China."\n\nYes they have a deal in mind. It is a great deal... for #ZTE & China. #China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy & they use these telecomm companies to spy & steal from us. Many hoped this time would be different. Now congress will need to act.  https://t.co/ETMUCe9ia6— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 25, 2018\n\n\nThe ZTE talks occur after the U.S. and China last weekend suspended plans to impose tariffs on as much as $200 billion in each other\'s goods, pulling back from the brink of a trade war. China on Tuesday made a conciliatory gesture by cutting the tariff on imported vehicles to 15 percent from 25 percent, effective July 1.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin famously said last weekend that the trade war is “on hold.”\nIn the face of congressional criticism, Mnuchin on Tuesday denied that the U.S. is offering relief for ZTE in exchange for trade concessions.\n"This is not a quid pro quo or anything else," Mnuchin told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee.\nFox News’ Alex Pappas and Chad Pergram and Fox Business’ Blake Burman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nJohn Roberts currently serves as the chief White House correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., a 15-term member of Congress, reportedly made the comments May 16 at a meeting in Washington, D.C., of a delegation from the Orange County Association of Realtors.\n“Every homeowner should be able to make a decision not to sell their home to someone [if] they don’t agree with their lifestyle,” Rohrabacher told the gathering, according to Wayne Woodyard, a former president of the Realtor organization, the Orange County Register\xa0reported.\n\nRohrabacher, who represents California’s 48th\xa0Congressional District in coastal Orange County, confirmed the “accuracy of the sentiment” Thursday, the Register reported.\nHe said homeowners should have the right to “choose who they do business with.” He distinguished race-based discrimination from refusing to do business with a person for their “lifestyle or political beliefs.” \xa0\n\nU.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher told a group of Realtors last week that homeowners should be able to refuse to sell their property to gays and lesbians, a statement that cost him the support of a key national Realtor group.https://t.co/Z1ggMGJT8Z— O.C.

John Roberts reports from the White House.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller claimed in a court filing Monday that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort tried to tamper with two potential witnesses in his upcoming trial while under house arrest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutors working for Mueller made the claim in a request that the judge overseeing the case revoke or revise an order for Manafort to be placed on pretrial release. They also said an associate of Manafort\'s tried to contact a potential witness more than once.\xa0\nA Manafort spokesman fired back, saying: “Mr. Manafort is innocent and nothing about this latest allegation changes our defense. We will do our talking in court.”\n\nBut according to documents filed in federal court in D.C., Manafort reached out to the would-be witnesses in February after a superseding indictment was unsealed. Among other claims, the indictment accused the 68-year-old of secretly paying European ex-politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine\'s pro-Russian government in the U.S. without registering. This coterie allegedly was dubbed the "Hapsburg" group by Manafort.\nMueller says the individuals Manafort tried to contact -- referred to only as "D1" and "D2" -- were "principals of a public-relations company [who] acted as intermediaries between Manafort ... co-defendant Richard Gates, and the Hapsburg group."\nAccording to Mueller\'s request, Manafort tried to make at least three phone calls and sent at least two encrypted text messages to D1 "in an effort to secure materially false testimony concerning the activities of the Hapsburg group." Specifically, Manafort allegedly told Person D1 on Feb. 26, "We should talk. I have made clear that [the Hapsburg group] worked in Europe."\n\n\n\nThe message was accompanied by a link to a Business Insider story with the headline: "Former European leaders struggle to explain themselves after Mueller claims Paul Manafort paid them to lobby for Ukraine."\nThe document said that D1 was trying to avoid contact with Manafort and "understood Manafort\'s outreach to be an effort to \'suborn perjury\'" because he believed from his experience that the Hapsburg Group lobbied in the United States and knew that Manafort knew that as well.\nThe documents added that a longtime Manafort associate, referred to as "Person A," tried to contact D2 in the days after the superseding indictment was unsealed.\nIn earlier filings, Person A has referred to Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime Manafort associate who prosecutors have said has ties to Russian intelligence.\n"My friend P is trying to reach [Person D1] to brief him on what’s going on," Person A texted Person D2 on Feb. 28, adding: "Basically P wants to give him a quick summary that he says to everybody (which is true) that our friends never lobbied in the U.S., and the purpose of the program was EU."\nMueller adds Person A messaged Person D2 again in April to ask for help connecting Manafort with Person D1.\n"I tried [Person D1] on all numbers," Person A said, according to the documents.\nAccording to the documents, Person D2 told investigators that Manafort wanted him and Person D1 to "relay a message to the Hapsburg group: if the members of the Hapsburg group were contacted by anyone, they should say that their lobbying and public relations work was exclusively in Europe."\nThe special counsel says Manafort\'s actions violate federal law, and therefore violate the terms of his pretrial release.\nManafort faces multiple felony charges in two federal cases, including conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, failing to register as an agent of a foreign principal, giving false and misleading Foreign Agents Registration Act statements and providing other false statements.\nHe has pleaded not guilty.\nFox News\' John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?’”\n\nBob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\nABC on Tuesday\xa0cancelled Barr’s popular reboot of “Roseanne” shortly after she posted a racist tweet targeting Jarrett, a former top Obama White House aide.\xa0In a now-deleted tweet, Barr described Jarrett as like “the muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.”\xa0\n\nJarrett said later Tuesday that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her before the network cancelled the show in response to Barr’s tweets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"He apologized,"\xa0Jarrett said during a MSNBC appearance. "He said he had zero tolerance for that sort of racist, bigoted comment and he wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling his show and so I appreciate that they did that so swiftly."\nVALERIE JARRETT SUGGESTS TRUMP SHARES BLAME FOR ROSEANNE TWEET\n\n\n\nTrump’s tweet was the first time the president mentioned the cancellation. He did not specify what anti-Trump comments have been made on ABC.\nOn Tuesday evening, the president held a rally in Nashville, Tenn., but did not mention Jarrett or Barr’s comments. When asked what the president’s reaction was to Barr’s tweets, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president has been “focused” on North Korea, trade and the economy.\n“The president is focused on North Korea. He’s focused on trade deals. And he’s focused on rebuilding our military, the economy. And that’s what he’s spending his time on; not responding to other things,” Sanders said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nRoseanne returns to Twitter to react to canceled show\n\n\nAsked whether the president thought Roseanne’s show should have been cancelled, Sanders said: “That’s not what he’s spending his time on. And I think that we have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now.”\nFox News’ Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution, including illegal immigrants with children.\n\n\nPut pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nThose parents are housed at adult detention centers, and consequently their children are separated from them, registered as “unaccompanied minors” and handed to the Department of Health and Human Services.\xa0\nTrump has blamed Democrats for the separation of children from their parents before. Last week he told Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that the breaking up of families occurred because of “bad laws that the Democrats gave us.”\nThe Associated Press reported that he appeared to be referring to a 2008 law to combat child trafficking -- a bipartisan law authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., but signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nWhile the law says nothing about separating families, it does say that children travelling alone from countries other than Mexico and Canada must be released in the “least restrictive setting” -- namely a family or shelter.\xa0\nThe Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy, designed to deter prospective illegal immigrants, means that illegal immigrants are no longer released with their children into the U.S. and consequently that their children are separated from them.\n“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Sessions\xa0said\xa0earlier this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”\nSESSIONS SAYS ALL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; CHILDREN MAY BE SEPARATED FROM PARENTS\xa0\nBut Trump called on Democratic lawmakers to end the practice, apparently as part of a deal that includes the ending of so-called “catch and release” whereby illegal immigrants are released into America while they wait for their court hearing. He also said that the diversity lottery visa and so-called chain migration -- where immigrants can sponsor family members for visas -- must end.\n“Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!” he tweeted.\nHe also returned to accusing Democrats of “protecting” MS-13 gang members. He has said repeatedly that their opposition to strong border policies, as well as the promotion of “sanctuary policies” in states like California and New York, mean criminal gang members get released back into communities.\n“Democrats are protecting MS-13 thugs,” he tweeted.\nTrump was criticized by Democrats for describing MS-13 members as “animals.” This week he accused Democrats of “trying to defend” them, noting that he was criticized for his remarks by Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY.\nFox News\' Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end?\xa0 So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media?\xa0 Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?” Trump tweeted Saturday.\n\nThere was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2018\n\n\nThe president was referring to a letter obtained and published by The New York Times on Saturday dated January 29, 2018 from former Trump attorney John Dowd and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow to Mueller regarding a potential interview with the president.\xa0\n\n"In order to facilitate a fair process, as a practical solution, without waiver of the President’s constitutional and statutory privileges or objections, and in exchange for a rapid conclusion, we are willing to receive any further questions and provide you the answers to help you complete your report and resolve any other remaining questions you might have," the letter, now obtained by Fox News, read. "We are prepared to meet to discuss a final list of questions that you need to be answered so that the Nation may move forward, and so that we may preserve the dignity of the Office of the President of the United States."\xa0\nThe president’s tweet comes days after the special counsel’s office released its second statement of expenditures for the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.\nTaxpayers have spent nearly $17 million on the Russia probe since it began in May 2017, according to the new spending report released Thursday.\n\n\n\nApproximately $10 million was spent between October 2017 and March 2018. That includes $4.5 million spent by Mueller’s team and another $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenditures attributable to the investigation.\n“The department will continue to dedicate and leverage resources to maintain strong program and financial management controls,” the DOJ said in the report. “Management takes its program and financial accountability seriously and is dedicated to ensuring that funds are used in a responsible and transparent manner.”\nThe president has repeatedly pointed fingers at Democrats for alleged collusion during the 2016 election—specifically the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign for their move to pay $9 million through law firm Perkins Coie to fund the now-infamous, and unverified, anti-Trump dossier.\nThe president has also blasted the special counsel team, referring to investigators as “Angry Democrats.” 13 of the 17 investigators on Mueller’s team are registered Democrats, while at least nine have donated to Democratic candidates and causes. Mueller, though, is said to be a lifelong Republican.\nRevelations of an FBI informant communicating with members of the Trump campaign — George Papadopoulos, Sam Clovis, and Carter Page\xa0— have set of new criticism from Trump for several ex-intelligence and law enforcement figures from the Obama administration.\xa0\nThe Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, is now investigating any alleged “impropriety or political motivation” in the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election, following demands from Trump, who has dubbed the news of the informant as “SPYGATE.”\nTrump’s lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said this week that he had drawn “red lines” for Mueller in talks over a possible interview with the president.\nGiuliani told Fox News Thursday that Mueller would have to meet two conditions for an interview to take place: provide access to the “spygate” files as well as the memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein outlining the scope of Mueller’s authority in the special counsel probe.\n\nThe United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2018\n\n\nThe president also tweeted on Saturday that the U.S. must be treated “fairly” in trade.\n“The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!” Trump tweeted.\n Fox News’ John Roberts and Alex Pappas contributed to this report. \n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday.\n“Rising gas prices will, as one economist put it, roughly cancel out the 2018 consumption boost from tax cuts,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-Calif., said Wednesday.\n\n“The best thing we can do to stop the worst part about the Trump agenda is to win the 2018 elections,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nWill Democrats\' midterm message get lost amid Russia probe?\n\n\nBut there are Democrats running for re-election in states President Trump won easily, so talk like that isn’t tenable for everyone in the party.\n“In West Virginia, people like Donald Trump, and they like Joe Manchin,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told Fox News.\xa0 “And you know what, we can work very well together.”\n\n\n\nManchin’s campaign has internal polling showing he has an early lead over Republican challenger, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who recently emerged from a bruising primary plagued by personal attacks.\nSo don’t expect to see Manchin, who is seeking a second full term, adopting the midterm strategy touted by Pelosi or Schumer.\n“It’s not me,” Manchin said. “If they’re going to adopt a policy up here they think is their winning ticket, I don’t think it’s a winning ticket for me at all.”\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nHow will Trump\'s approval rating impact the midterms?\n\n\nRepublicans candidates hoping to help the party retain or expand its congressional majorities are field-testing messages focused on the benefits of tax reform, a reduction in regulations, and the appointments of conservatives to courtrooms across the country.\n“If you look at the Supreme Court nominations, our judges right now are filling the federal courts, making good decisions based on the Constitution, not trying to be activist judges,” Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., told Fox News.\nSenate hopefuls are also offering themselves as helpful to a president who has struggled at times to convince lawmakers in his own party to align with his policy proposals.\n“The president\'s agenda is to save the middle class and that\'s what we’re working toward,” Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Fox News, about his campaign to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawley, considered a top GOP recruit this cycle, is also borrowing anti-establishment rhetoric reminiscent of President Trump’s, calling McCaskill a member of the “D.C. Cartel,” which has “feathered its own nest.”\nBorrowing from President Trump’s 2016 phrase-book has already proven successful for Senate primary winners in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n“The wall is being built,” Rep.

Trump confirmed that the visiting official gave him a personal letter from dictator Kim Jong Un, though he hadn\'t yet read it.\n\n\n.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump is presented with a letter from North Korean Leader Kim Jung Un, Friday, June 1, 2018, by North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C. (Official @WhiteHouse Photo by Shealah Craighead) pic.twitter.com/h4tKjtMCD7— Dan Scavino Jr. (@Scavino45) June 1, 2018\n\n\n"We\'re going to deal," Trump said.\xa0\nTrump spoke to reporters after an extraordinary scene played out on White House grounds, with Trump hosting the North Korean official for over an hour in the Oval Office -- the latest gesture in an effort by both sides to get talks back on track after North Korea\'s belligerent rhetoric prompted Trump to nix the summit last week.\xa0\nTrump said the meeting was supposed to just be about "the delivery of a letter" but ended up being a lengthy conversation with the "second most powerful man in North Korea."\xa0\n\n\n\n“We talked about a lot of\xa0things," Trump said. "We really did.\xa0But the big deal will be on June 12.”\nAfter the meeting, Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo were seen taking photos with the visitors.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean visitor to the United States since Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington in 2000 to meet President Bill Clinton. He is North Korea\'s former military intelligence chief and is one of the North Korean leader\'s closest aides.\nTrump said they also discussed ending the Korean War between North and South Korea.\n“Can you believe that we\'re talking about the ending of the Korean War?” Trump told reporters. “We\'re talking about 70 years.”\nTRUMP-KIM SUMMIT, FROM THE INVITATION TO THE CANCELLATION: A TIMELINE\nThe official\'s arrival in Washington came a day after Pompeo declared that he was confident negotiations with Pyongyang over holding a nuclear summit were "moving in the right direction."\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol allowed into US despite name on sanctions list\n\n\n"Our two countries face a pivotal moment in our relationship, and it would be nothing short of tragic to let this opportunity go to waste," Pompeo said in New York after meeting with Kim.\nThe two countries, eyeing the first summit between the U.S. and the North after six decades of hostility, have also been holding negotiations in Singapore and the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.\nKim Yong Chol left his hotel in New York City early Friday for the trip to Washington in a convoy of SUVs. Pompeo, the former CIA chief who has traveled to North Korea and met with Kim Jong Un twice in the past two months, said he believed the country\'s leaders are "contemplating a path forward where they can make a strategic shift, one that their country has not been prepared to make before."\nFox News’ John Roberts and Serafin Gomez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\xa0\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

But it’s unclear if they’ll get there.\xa0\nWe’ll know soon if a coalition comprised of many House Democrats and some Republicans will successfully make an end run around the House GOP leadership. Securing 218 signatures on what’s called a “discharge petition” in the House could prompt debate and votes on a sequence of immigration and DACA proposals. Such a maneuver goes against the wishes of GOP leaders.\xa0\n\nThe number of signatories to the discharge petition is locked at 213 since the House abandoned Washington May 24 for the Memorial Day recess. Eight House members signed the discharge petition that day, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and two Republicans: Reps. Tom Reed (R-NY) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) was the last member to sign, clocking in at 213.\xa0\nBut two questions: Can supporters obtain 218 signatures? And does anyone in the House truly want to be number 218? After all, the discharge petition rests on the dais in the chamber when the House is in session. There is a line for each signature, designated by a number. For good or ill, someone will bear the moniker “Mr. or Ms. 218” if the discharge petition is to be successful.\xa0\nHouse rules dictate the body can only consider a discharge petition on the second and fourth Mondays of each month. The original House calendar slated the House to meet on Monday, June 11 – the second Monday of June. But House Republican leaders scrapped that date and re-tooled the week so the House would meet next Friday, not Monday. Little was said about this sleight of hand at the time. But the concern was obvious. The GOP brass didn’t want discharge petition supporters to get two chances in June to go over their heads and deposit an immigration debate on the floor.\xa0\n\n\n\nSo, the next available date for a discharge petition to ripen for consideration comes on the fourth Monday of the month: June 25. However, House rules dictate that a discharge petition must command the necessary signatures seven legislative days in advance (e.g. - days when the House meets). In reality, this means supporters of the petition must marshal 218 signatures by around June 11. The next eligible discharge petition date in the queue falls on July 23.\nBackers of the discharge petition are frankly running out of track. Due to resignations and a death, House membership stands at 428. Only 23 of the the chamber’s 235 Republicans have offered support for the petition. All but three of the House’s 193 Democrats have signed. Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Filemon Vela (D-TX) and Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX) all represent border districts in Texas. That trio objects to the discharge petition because of President Trump’s border wall. They’re concerned one of the bills plonked onto the floor could prompt construction of the wall. But the House wouldn’t get to 218 even if Cuellar, Vela and Gonzalez do sign. Whether its three signatures or five signatures, Democrats can’t pull the discharge petition across the finish line themselves. The final signatures must come from Republicans.\nBut is that even in the offing?\nWho might discharge petition supporters coax to sign?\nThe most obvious candidate to sign is Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA). Issa is retiring after narrowly winning re-election last cycle in a swing district southern California. Issa has bucked his party before, voting nay on the final version of the tax reform bill.\xa0\nAt first blush, one might think Rep. Dan Donovan (R-NY) would be another possible signer. Donovan is a moderate Republican who also rejected the tax bill. Donovan’s the only Republican who represents any part of New York City. Donovan’s district covers all of Staten Island and a spit of Brooklyn. President Trump may hail from Queens, but Donovan’s district is Trump country. President Obama narrowly carried the district in 2012. But Mr. Trump won it by 10 points two years ago. Donovan is now locked in a tight primary with former Rep. Michael Grimm (R-NY). The president just endorsed Donovan in his primary.\nModerate House Republicans or those who represent battleground districts fall into the next tier of scrutiny for the discharge petition. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) is a freshman in a district he flipped from blue to red last cycle. But DACA isn’t a major issue in Omaha the way it is in some other U.S. cities. Other moderate GOPers or those who represent swing districts? Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ) would be one. He’s retiring.\xa0\nRep. Jamie Herrera Beutler (R-WA) could be another possibility due to some of her moderate tendencies.\nThen there are committee chairmen like House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA), Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-TX). But the biggest impediment to this troika signing is the fact that, yep, they chair committees. Royce, Frelinghuysen and Sessions serve in those roles serve at the pleasure of the Republican brass.\nStill, Royce represents a district carried by Hillary Clinton, and he is retiring. Frelinghuysen’s district is a toss-up and he’s quitting. Sessions also represents a district carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\nWho else? Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) represents a swing district on the border. But McSally’s now running hard to the right to outflank other conservatives in a bid to capture the Arizona GOP Senate nomination.\xa0\nSo it’s not clear where discharge petition backers can unearth the final five to sign. House math is hampering them. There are only 428 members in the House and not the full membership of 435. A membership deficit of seven members could prove fatal to the effort. Consider this: Former Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) resigned. The late Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY) unexpectedly passed away. Former Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-PA) represented a district that may be in play this fall. Conyers and Slaughter would have signed the petition, few questions asked. Meehan may have been a candidate to sign as well.\nThe GOP leadership is scrambling to engineer agreement on a separate, conservative immigration bill and stave off the discharge petition revolt. At this point, it’s hard to see how that measure commands 218 votes. And, at this point, it could be a stretch for the discharge petition to muster 218 signatures, as well.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

But regulations stemming from laws like the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act are putting "remediation" on hold.\xa0\n\n“I heard firsthand accounts from our Border Patrol agents that environmental red tape is hindering their ability to secure the border,” Utah Rep. Rob Bishop, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, told Fox News this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February of 2015, agents discovered a sophisticated border tunnel the length of three football fields in the town of Naco, Arizona. The tunnel was outfitted with wooden supports and a cement shaft with a hydraulic lift.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Obtained by Fox News)\n\n\n\nBishop, along with Arkansas GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman, traveled to the Arizona border in February to meet with border agents and discuss how environmental laws and regulations are impacting security. Bishop, who has legislation aimed at addressing these issues, said they learned of the "significant delay in remediating illicit tunnels," a process where they are filled with gravel and concrete.\nA Customs and Border Protection official confirmed to Fox News they\'ve encountered “long delays” in remediating tunnels, acknowledging environmental regulations make up a “good portion of the delay.”\xa0\n\n\n\nThe official said other delays come with “clearing out a tunnel, mapping out the tunnel underground to know where to remediate from above, getting funding for the remediation and fulfilling a contract to a construction company to carry out the remediation.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas GOP Rep. Bruce Westerman and Utah Rep. Rob Bishop, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, traveled to the Arizona border in February and met with border agents to discuss how environmental laws and regulations are impacting border security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Via the House Committee on Natural Resources)\n\n\n\nOne particularly protracted response revolved around a\xa0sophisticated border tunnel -- the length of three football fields -- discovered in the town of Naco, Ariz., in February 2015. Photos show the tunnel complete with wooden supports and a cement shaft with a hydraulic lift.\nFox News learned it took between nine months and a year before it was fully remediated. Agents were told it was because of environmental concerns.\xa0\nWhile this played out during the Obama administration, officials say agents are still encountering these kinds of delays under the current administration.\xa0\n“Border security should never take a backseat to the EPA, when you consider the dangerous drugs that come into this country, such as fentanyl," Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, said in an interview. "That tunnel was assuredly used to bring fentanyl into this country, and other dangerous drugs. They don’t use tunnels like that simply to bring in illegal immigrants. They use those for their high-dollar products, such as illicit drugs.”\n\n\n\n\n\nA tunnel discovered in Naco, Arizona in 2015 included wooden supports and a cement shaft with a hydraulic lift.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Obtained by Fox News)\n\n\n\nThe tug-of-war over access to federal land has gone on for decades and flared frequently under the Obama administration. While border agents need to patrol that territory, several other agencies are tasked with protecting that land from human interference. Everything from moving surveillance equipment to improving a road can take months.\nWhile Judd mentioned the EPA, the process actually involves a range of agencies – especially those within the Interior and Agriculture departments. A 2006 agreement with those departments gave border agents access to federal land under certain conditions.\xa0When Bishop raised this issue during the prior administration, the Interior Department stressed that the agencies work closely together – and that they have to balance security needs with environmental protection.\xa0\nBut delays in filling tunnels have become a source of frustration.\xa0\nJudd said agents are frustrated when they have to "babysit" a tunnel during an environmental review because it takes up resources that could be used elsewhere.\nTunnels are most common in the San Diego sector, according to the Natural Resources Committee. But even the most seemingly simple tunnels to fix can take several months.\nIn 2014, according to the committee, San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents discovered a small tunnel that used a rail system to move items under the border into the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hydraulic lift of a tunnel discovered by agents in 2015. It took 9 months to a year to fill in the tunnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Obtained by Fox News)\n\n\n\nThe tunnel itself was nearly 4 feet, 6 inches high and 2 feet wide. It ran 2,500 feet in length and ran about 1,000 feet into the United States.\nThe area contained a small wetland. It took about four months to complete a bird study and fill in the tunnel.\nThe committee has cited that example as a “best-case scenario,” in comparison with other tunnels, where remediation has taken longer because of various regulations.\nOther border tunnels discovered in the San Diego area have made news before. Last August, border agents arrested 30 illegal immigrants, including 23 Chinese nationals, outside a smuggling tunnel. The tunnel was near a border fence line, but was hidden by dry brush and branches. It\'s unclear whether there were any delays in filling that passageway.\xa0\nBishop is now pushing legislation to make the remediation of tunnels on federal lands -- and a range of other CBP activities -- exempt from the requirements of environmental laws, like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.\xa0\nBishop’s proposal, tucked into two border security bills, would specifically limit the power of the Interior and Agriculture departments to hinder border agents on the job. Neither department has responded to a request for comment from Fox News.\xa0\xa0\n“Our border patrol agents need the tools and authority to secure our Southern border, and without streamlining the bureaucracy, that won’t happen,” Bishop said.\nFox News\' Judson Berger contributed to this report.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

It also makes it harder to pay federal unions to appeal firings and to lobby Congress.\xa0\nThe third executive order, focused on federal unions, is aimed at reducing waste and expenditures and requires federal employees to spend at least 75 percent of their time working on the job they were hired to do, as opposed to working on federal union work. It will also allow the federal government to start charging unions for office space in federal buildings.\xa0\n\n\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal,\xa0Andrew Bremberg, who leads Trump’s domestic policy council, said the orders "will make it easier for agencies to remove poor-performing employees and ensure that taxpayer dollars are more efficiently used.”\xa0\nThe Journal also reported that unions representing federal employees said the orders would deprive their members of significant labor rights.\n“These executive orders are a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed to the two million public-sector employees across the country who work for the federal government,” said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees, whose membership includes some 700,000 U.S. government and D.C. workers.\n“This administration seems hellbent on replacing a civil service that works for all taxpayers with a political service that serves at its whim,” The Journal quoted Cox as saying.\nCox said in the newspaper that his union was prepared to take its challenge to Congress and the public.\nFox News’ Kristin Brown and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

It became clear that the one person who was best qualified in all areas was also the person who had spent the past 22 months traveling 70,000 miles with me: Rosemary Hansen, my wife.”\n\nBarnett credited his wife with being instrumental in the creation of his #OneKansas agenda, which includes adding jobs, improving health care options and fixing education in the state.\n“Rosie’s extensive experience and knowledge of organization and management will help me improve the functioning of a state government that has gone off the rails in the past eight years,” he said.\nHansen has a Master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University and a law degree from the University of Minnesota. She’s served overseas with as a foreign service officer with the State Department, holding positions in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Thailand, according to Barnett’s campaign website.\n\n\n\nBarnett, who was the 2006 GOP nominee for Kansas governor,\xa0is one of four major Republican candidates for governor in a crowded field with a sizable part of the Republican electorate undecided. Primary elections are in August.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Lee wants Robert Mueller to wrap up his investigation\nRepublican senator from Utah says the Russia probe \'doesn\'t need to drag on for four years.\'\n\n\n\n\nTaxpayers have spent nearly $17 million on the Russia probe since Special Counsel Robert Mueller took over the investigation last year, according to a new spending report released Thursday by the Justice Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout $10 million was spent between October and March, the document states. That includes $4.5 million spent by Mueller’s team and another $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenditures attributable to the investigations.\n“The department will continue to dedicate and leverage resources to maintain strong program and financial management controls,” the DOJ said in the report. “Management takes its program and financial accountability seriously and is dedicated to ensuring that funds are used in a responsible and transparent manner.”\n\n\n\nSpecial counsel expenses between Oct. 1 and March 31\n\n\n\nPersonnel compensation and benefits -- $2,738,131\n\n\nTravel -- $532,340\n\n\nTransportation of things - \xa0$1,345\n\n\nRent, communications and utilities - $886,403\n\n\nContractual services - $264,114\n\n\nSupplies and materials - $29,694\n\n\nAcquisition of equipment - $54,597\n\n\nTOTAL - $ 4,506,624\n\n\nDoes not include the $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenses related to the Russia probe during this time.\n\n\xa0\n\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Previously, the Justice Department said that during the May-September 2017 period, the investigation cost nearly $7 million.\nTRUMP COMPLAINS ABOUT COST OF RUSSIA PROBE\nThat sum included $3.2 million in direct Special Counsel expenses and $3.5 million for other DOJ expenses, covering costs like agents working on raids or interviews and other government contractors.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe spending report said these expenses would “have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence” of Mueller’s probe.\nEarlier this month, President Trump complained on Twitter about the money being spent on the “witch hunt.”\n“At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt,” Trump asked in one tweet.\n\n....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018\n\n\nMueller is investigating Russia’s attempted interference in the 2016 election, and whether there was any collusion with Trump campaign officials. The investigation has also ensnared other Trump officials, like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manfort, over other issues.\nTrump has repeatedly said there was “no collusion.”\nFox News’ Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

They represent the diversity of our nation — a nation in which we are free to express our opinions,” he said.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to disinvite the whole team marks the end of speculations of whether the Eagles, who won Super Bowl LII in February, would attend the White House in some capacity. The team reportedly wanted to send a small group of players.\n“The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!” Trump tweeted late Monday, reiterating his opposition to hosting the team over politics.\nEagles Brandon Graham, Malcolm Jenkins, Chris Long and Torrey Smith previously stated they would not attend the ceremony.\nTorrey Smith, a wide receiver who played for the Eagles during the 2017 season, attacked the president’s decision and said he "continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military."\nHe added that the players in the team have a wide-ranging views and anyone who wanted to attend the White House “should\'ve been able to go,” but canceling the event was “a cowardly act.”\nThe White House will still hold a ceremony on Tuesday for a group of 1,000 fans in which Trump said he “will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem."\nFox News\' Nicole Darrah, Kaitlyn Schallhorn contributed to this report.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting -- it was memorial day too -- i went 2 far & do not want it defended -- it was egregious Indefensible.”\nFine. She’s right. There is no defense. What planet do you have to be on to talk about a black person and “Planet of the Apes”?\nThere is also no question that ABC knew exactly what it was getting, which is why network president Ben Sherwood told the New York Times back in March that “you can’t control Roseanne Barr. Many who have tried have failed.”\n\n\n\nSo obviously the network wasn’t unaware that Barr had a long history of tweeting ugly, unproven insults and wild conspiracy theories. And presumably she wasn’t on Ambien all those times.\nRoseanne retweeted at one point that “ABC is allowing the Trump haters to control their station” — even though it was the network that provided the platform for her pro-Trump reboot in the first place.\nThe network gambled that she could revive her hit show — which she did, specifically tailored to appeal to Trump Country — and she did. But even as she was riding high, Roseanne couldn’t stay off the Twitter. And that cost her, the hundreds of people who worked on the show and the network that invested in her.\nWith so many pundits on the left blaming the Roseanne debacle on Trump — who, of course, had nothing to do with it besides enjoying the show’s success — it was only a matter of time before the president joined the fray.\nIt’s noteworthy that Trump made no comment on Barr’s racist tweet. Instead, he tweeted that Disney CEO Bob Iger “Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‘ABC does not tolerate comments like those’ made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?”\nI’m sure unfair things have been said about Trump on ABC News and every other network. I’m just as sure that they didn’t fall into the category of likening him to an ape.\nBut HBO’s Bill Maher, five years ago, did jokingly compare Trump’s hair to an orangutan. And ABC’s lightning-quick dumping of “Roseanne” does raise questions about the media and cultural standards used when public personalities say offensive things.\nNo action was taken against Joy Behar, for instance, when the “View” co-host mocked Vice President Pence’s religion. She eventually apologized, first privately and then publicly.\nMSNBC took no action against Joy Reid when a torrent of her homophobic tweets surfaced from a decade ago. She ludicrously claimed that her account had been hacked, but also apologized for her “dumb” and “hateful” postings.\nAnd ESPN action took no action against former “Sports Center” co-host Jemele Hill for calling the president a “white supremacist” and “bigot.” But the network suspended her for suggestion a boycott of the Dallas Cowboys for cracking down on player protests.\nOn the other hand, CNN fired host Reza Aslan for tweeting that Trump was a “piece of s---” and “embarrassment to humankind.”\nCNN also fired pro-Trump contributor Jeffrey Lord for tweeting the Nazi salute “Sieg Heil.”\nSarah Sanders weighed in Wednesday, saying:\n“Where was Bob Iger‘s apology to the White House staff for\xa0Jemele Hill\xa0calling the president and anyone associated with him a white supremacist? To Christians around the world for\xa0Joy Behar\xa0calling Christianity a mental illness? Where was the apology for\xa0Kathy Griffin going on a profane rant against the president on\xa0‘The View’\xa0after a photo showed her holding President Trump’s decapitated head? And where was the apology from Bob Iger for ESPN hiring\xa0Keith Olbermann\xa0after his numerous expletive-laced tweets attacking the president as a Nazi and even expanding his role after that attack against the president’s family?”\nThose are legitimate questions. In fairness, CNN dumped Griffin, and Olbermann, who made some extremely harsh anti-Trump videos for GQ, is being used by ESPN only on sports. But would the treatment have been different if the target wasn’t Trump?\nThe bottom line is that each media organization sets its own standards, depending on the gravity of the offense, the popularity of the performer and the person’s past record.\nThese problems were once far easier to sweep under the rug. But we all live in Twitter’s world now, where one ill-chosen phrase can end a career and online mobs can form at a moment’s notice.\nRoseanne Barr woke up Tuesday morning with the most popular show on television. But hours later she was unemployed because she touched the third rail of racism, and ABC executives concluded she had crossed a very bright line.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

Jennifer Griffin shares details for \'Special Report.\'\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump said Saturday that he is “very surprised” about China’s alleged militarization of a string of islands in the South China Sea, which Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis reportedly said were used for “intimidation and coercion.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New York Times reported Saturday that Mattis, during a speech in Singapore, criticized the Chinese government’s placement of advanced military equipment and missiles in the South China Sea.\xa0\n“Despite China’s claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapons systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,” Mattis reportedly said during a speech on Saturday at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, a regional security conference.\n\nOn Saturday, the president tweeted: “Very surprised that China would be doing this?”\xa0\n\nVery surprised that China would be doing this? https://t.co/D03kV07dF7— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2018\n\n\nThe president’s tweet comes after the White House announced the official U.S. delegation to China for a series of upcoming meetings slated to be held next week, following talks held in Beijing and Washington last month.\xa0\nThe talks will be focused on “rebalancing the bilateral economic relationship” between the U.S. and China.\xa0\n\n\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also said in a statement that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will lead the discussions and will be joined by U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass, Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted McKinney, and U.S. Trade Representative Chief Agricultural Negotiator Ambassador Gregg Doud.\xa0\nAdditional officials from the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, Energy, Agriculture and the U.S. Trade Representative will also participate in the upcoming talks.\xa0\nThe meetings come following the Trump administration’s decision to slap tariffs on allies Canada, Mexico, and the European Union’s steel and aluminum shipments to the U.S. Trump has threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese products to punish Beijing for pressuring U.S. companies to turn over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market. China has vowed to retaliate with tariffs of its own.\xa0\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Tom Udall, D-N.M., Thursday after the lawmaker asked whether President Trump\'s foreign policy was guided by "personal conflicts of interest."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"Given that the president refuses to disclose his tax returns," Udall asked Pompeo during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, "how can you assure the American people that American foreign policy is free of his personal conflicts of interest?"\nAfter a pause, Pompeo told Udall that he found the question "bizarre," to which Udall answered: "You don\'t want to answer it, then? You just want to describe it as bizarre and not give me an answer?"\n\n"I think that’s indicative of my answer, Senator," Pompeo responded. "I’ve been incredibly involved in this administration’s foreign policy now for some 16 months and I have seen literally no evidence of what you are scurrilously, scurrilously suggesting.\n"It is an outrageous suggestion."\nUdall shot back that his question was not scurrilous, saying "this has been raised by a number of people out there."\n\n\n\n"Yes, sir, yes, sir it has," answered Pompeo with a sarcastic chuckle. "You want me to tell you who those folks are and what their political interest may well be?"\n"No, I know, it\'s fake news," said Udall sardonically.\nThe exchange was a notably contentious moment during a hearing that focused on the cancellation of a planned summit between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\nTrump was repeatedly criticized during the 2016 election campaign for not releasing copies of his tax returns. At the time, Trump claimed his returns were under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and said he’d release them once the review was complete.\nFox News\' Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

It was the constant in-fighting between warring factions that prompted John Boehner to quit in 2015, and Ryan was drafted despite the fact that he didn\'t really want the job. Two and a half years later, he announced that he\'d had enough. \n\nAnd the Wisconsin congressman is still getting grief.\nThe Washington Post says Ryan "is losing his grip on the feuding House Republican conference just months before pivotal midterm elections, caught between dueling factions vying for power inside the party and facing scattered calls for his departure ahead of a planned year-end retirement."\nThe New York Times says that "with Republicans in revolt on both his right and his left, Mr. Ryan is increasingly facing questions about whether he can manage to stumble across the finish line."\n\n\n\n And Politico says Ryan is embattled "as his Republican Conference spirals into an all-out war that could put his speakership on the line."\n Doesn\'t sound like a whole lotta fun.\nThe first flashing neon light came when House Republicans couldn\'t even pass a farm bill, which ought to be a piece of cake. The legislation was derailed by a battle over immigration.\nAnd immigration reared its head when a group of Republican moderates signed a discharge petition to force a floor vote on DACA and related border matters. They don\'t have the votes yet, but are acting in open defiance of the speaker, who once favored an immigration compromise but has no interest in a bloody battle in a midterm election year. House conservatives want Ryan to pressure the moderates into backing down.\nRyan\'s backing seemed to be eroding when the Weekly Standard reported that White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said he\'d privately talked to Kevin McCarthy about orchestrating a leadership vote to force Democrats in dicey districts to support Nancy Pelosi. Mulvaney quickly backed away from the idea. McCarthy, as House majority leader, is Ryan\'s presumed successor but has made no move to try to take over this year.\nThere was grumbling after Ryan\'s retirement announcement in April that the GOP couldn\'t go eight months with a lame-duck speaker and with Democrats a credible threat to take over the House. \nRyan, who\'s had his difficulties with President Trump, has had a frustrating tenure, with the big tax cut bill his only major accomplishment. He and the Republicans fell short on immigration and repealing ObamaCare, among other things. And the cupboard is pretty bare, as everyone knows Congress doesn\'t get much done in the second half of an election year.\nAs the Post says from talking to Hill sources, "there is not a viable alternative to Ryan who can win enough support within the GOP for a clean transition before November — and there is little stomach at the moment for the messy battle that would ensue when Ryan departs."\nSo for all the negative stories, the great likelihood is that Ryan, who says he\'s not going anywhere, probably can\'t be forced out. But given the heartburn level right now, he probably can\'t wait to get back to his home town of Janesville.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

Napolitano breaks down whether or not President Trump can pardon himself and what would happen if he did.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump said he does have a right to pardon himself, but maintained he is innocent of any wrongdoing.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"As have been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?" Trump said in a June 4 tweet, saying the Russia investigation "continues into" the midterm elections.\xa0\n\nAs has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2018\n\n\nTrump first gave constitutional scholars a reason to engage in what one called their “favorite parlor game” – arguing over whether a president can self-pardon\xa0– with a tweet last year.\n\n“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us,” Trump tweeted\xa0in July 2017.\n\nWhile all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2017\n\n\nThe Washington Post reported last year that the president had been asking advisers about his ability to pardon aides, family members and himself as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion with Russia during the presidential election continued.\xa0Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\'s attorneys, has said Trump "probably" has the ability to pardon himself but doesn\'t plan to do so.\nWhether a president has the ability to issue a self-pardon is a favorite topic for lawyers to debate as there is really no clear resolution, Jonathan Turley, a legal scholar and law professor at George Washington University, told Fox News.\n\n\n\nRead on for more on the debate.\nA president could make a ‘good-faith’ case for self-pardon\nTurley has argued in multiple columns and on his own blog that while the Constitution should bar self-pardons, it doesn’t.\n“The language of Article II is quite explicit in giving the president a pardon power over federal offenses with the only exception related to impeachments. Donald Trump can certainly make a good-faith textual case for the right to self-pardon,” Turley told Fox News.\nTurley added that he objects to those “who are claiming clarity” in the argument.\n“The fact that there is no clear answer after so many debates reflects the difficulty of the question,” he said. “The text would seem to support a self-pardon while there are good-faith arguments that it would contradict underlying values of the constitution.”\nHOW DO PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS WORK?\nAnd while he said that it shouldn’t work, Michigan State Law professor Brian Kalt argued on his blog that a president “can certainly try” to self-pardon.\n“The reason for uncertainty is that no president has ever tried to pardon himself, so no court has had the opportunity to decide the question,” Kalt said. “Until a president purports to pardon himself, and until a federal prosecutor tries to prosecute him anyway, we cannot know what the courts think about this.”\nA presidential self-pardon ‘should not be regarded as valid’\nWhile a court hasn’t ruled on the constitutionality of self-pardons, the answer is pretty evident, according to Richard Primus, a legal scholar and law professor at the University of Michigan.\n“I think it’s pretty clear that there’s a right answer, and that answer is self-pardon should not be regarded as valid. A power to self-pardon would violate the basic rule-of-law principle that no person should be allowed to adjudicate his own case,” Primus told Fox News, adding that a pardon “by its nature might require two parties.”\n“It’s really hard to imagine asking the Framers, ‘Hey, do you think the most powerful person in the government you’re creating should be able to break laws and then let himself off the hook?’ and having the Framers answer, ‘Yes, he should be able to do that,’” Primus continued.\nRichard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told Fox News that the definition of the word “pardon” gives him pause when it comes to the idea that a president can self-pardon.\n“What drives my view is the meaning of the word pardon – forgiveness, to forgive someone else,” he said.\nWHO IS JACK JOHNSON AND WHY WOULD TRUMP PARDON HIM?\nPainter said that giving the president the ability to self-pardon could allow for him to “commit any crimes he wanted in office” and then pardon himself before he left office.\n“Why in the world would the Founders want that in the constitution,” Painter said.\nKermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, agreed that the president doesn’t have the authority to pardon himself, citing “the rule against political self-dealing.”\n“Constitutional silence about something so obviously problematic should be read to indicate it’s not allowed,” Roosevelt told Fox News.\nHe said it’s “unlikely” that the Supreme Court would take up the issue.\n“The only way that could happen would be if the president did try to pardon himself (unlikely in my view) and then a prosecutor indicted him (also unlikely, at least until he’s out of office) and then the president raised the pardon as a defense,” Roosevelt added.\nShould a president self-pardon?\nWhile constitutional scholars might disagree on the legality of self-pardons, Turley said that all should be able to agree on one point – “self-pardons are inherently abusive and ignoble.” \xa0\n“No president in history has used this power to pardon himself – not Andrew Johnson, not Richard Nixon, not Bill Clinton. It would be a truly ignoble, historical moment for Donald Trump to use this type of power,” Turley said.\nDr. David Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University, pointed to Nixon’s scandal-ridden presidency when asked if Trump could self-pardon.\n“The abiding rule, repeated many times, was that ‘the president is not above the law,’” Woodard told Fox News. “By that, I think that official power might have been legal – but it proved to be politically suicidal.”\n“The difference between public power and political responsibility makes some actions impossible,” Woodard added.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

The Washington Food Industry Association pledged $30,000.\n\nReferendum backers will have to gather 17,632 signatures of registered Seattle voters by June 14 to get the measure on the ballot.\nThe so-called head tax will charge businesses making at least $20 million in gross revenues about $275 per full-time worker each year. The tax would begin in 2019 and raise about $48 million a year to build affordable housing and provide emergency homeless services.\nOpponents say the Seattle measure is a tax on jobs and questioned whether city officials are spending current resources effectively.\n\n\n\nWorker and church groups and others praised the tax as a step toward building badly needed affordable housing in an affluent city where the income gap continues to widen and lower-income workers are being priced out.\nThe clash over who should pay to solve the city housing crisis that\'s exacerbated by Seattle\'s rapid economic growth featured weeks of tense exchanges, raucous meetings and a threat by Amazon, the city\'s largest employer, to stop construction planning on a 17-story building near its hometown headquarters.\nAmazon has resumed planning the downtown building, but the company remains "apprehensive about the future created by the council\'s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here," said Drew Herdener, Amazon\'s vice president for global corporate and operations communications.\nFour councilmembers initially pitched an annual tax of $500 per full-time employee before a compromise proposal lowered the tax rate after they could not muster six votes needed to override a potential veto by Mayor Jenny Durkan.\nThe mayor signed the head tax on May 16, saying "we must make urgent progress on our affordability and homelessness crisis."\nSeattle\'s action came as cities around San Francisco consider business taxes to help offset issues created by the growth of tech companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

I’m skipping this political stunt at the White House and just invited the Eagles to Congress. @Eagles How about a tour of the Capitol? https://t.co/niWR7zkSYx— Senator Bob Casey (@SenBobCasey) June 4, 2018\n\n\nTorrey Smith, a wide receiver who played for the Eagles during the 2017 season before being traded to the Carolina Panthers, said Trump\'s statement released Monday consisted of lies, and said the president "continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military."\n\nSo many lies smh Here are some facts 1. Not many people were going to go2. No one refused to go simply because Trump “insists” folks stand for the anthem  3. The President continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military pic.twitter.com/89GUNhJ4eE— Torrey Smith (@TorreySmithWR) June 4, 2018\n\n\nThe NFL player added that Eagles players have different views and that anyone who wanted to attend the ceremony "should\'ve been able to go. It’s a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don’t want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish."\n\nThere are a lot of people on the team that have plenty of different views. The men and women that wanted to go should’ve been able to go. It’s a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don’t want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish— Torrey Smith (@TorreySmithWR) June 4, 2018\n\n\nA group of 1,000 fans, however, are still invited to attend a "different type" of event, one which Trump said "will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem."\nTrump in September 2017 rescinded the Golden State Warriors\' invitation to visit the White House after they won the NBA championship because Stephen Curry was "hesitating," while several players from the New England Patriots, who won Super Bowl LI, skipped the traditional visit.\nThe ceremony to "celebrate America" is scheduled to take place at the White House Tuesday at 3 p.m.\nFox News\' Kaitlyn Schallhorn contributed to this report.\n\nNicole Darrah covers breaking and trending news for FoxNews.com.

A total double standard but that’s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!” Trump tweeted on Friday.\n\n\nWhy aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that’s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2018\n\n\nThe president’s tweet followed Bee’s vulgar comments about his daughter this week. Bee apologized for using an “expletive” to describe her, calling it “inappropriate and inexcusable.”\n“I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it,” Bee said Thursday.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nSamantha Bee apologizes for insulting Ivanka Trump\n\n\nTBS issued an apology as well, saying that Bee “has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump,” and that “those words should not have been aired.”\n\n\n\n“It was our mistake too, and we regret it,” TBS said in a statement.\nBee made the comments about Ivanka Trump -- and a photo of her and her child -- while slamming the administration\'s policies toward immigrant families.\xa0\n“You know Ivanka, that’s a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad’s immigration practices you feckless c----!” Bee said. “He listens to you! Put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to f----ing stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clip of Bee’s monologue was uploaded to her YouTube channel where the words “c---“ and “f---“ were not censored.\nBee received a special honor from the Television Academy on Thursday for “advancing social change” for her work on the show.\nBarr, meanwhile, was canned after tweeting that former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett was like “the muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.”\nBarr apologized for her comments, blaming her tweets on the sleeping medication, Ambien.\xa0\nABC immediately cancelled the reboot of her 1980’s sitcom, “Roseanne,” and CEO of Disney Bob Iger called Jarrett to apologize.\nTrump has criticized Iger this week.\n\nBob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?— Donald J.

Tom Garrett announced Monday he was not seeking re-election because of his ongoing battle with alcoholism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement comes just three days after Garrett reassured voters he was not abandoning his run for a second term in Congress despite a week of turmoil,\xa0including reports\xa0he and his wife turned staffers into his own “personal servants.”\n“Any person – Republican, Democrat or independent—who has known me for any period of time and has any integrity knows two things: I am a good man and I’m an alcoholic,” Garrett said in a video recorded at the state Capitol in Richmond. “This is the hardest statement that I have ever publicly made by far. It’s also the truth.”\n\nGarrett\'s tepid fundraising had worried members of his party, but he said his decision not to seek another term was not motivated by fear of losing his seat. Garrett said "sometimes winning means knowing where your priorities should be."\n"This isn\'t an ending for me, or my values of service to my fellow man, it\'s just a new beginning," Garrett said.\nFOLLOW COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\n\n\nRepublican party of Virginia Chairman John Whitbeck thanked Garrett for his service in a statement released late Monday:\n"On behalf of Republicans around Virginia and especially in the Fifth District, we thank Tom Garrett for his service. Substance abuse is a serious issue that reaches even to the halls of Congress. Tom has tremendous courage for bringing his own struggle to light. We wish him and his family all the best.\nThe Fifth District Committee will begin the process of choosing a replacement nominee immediately. "Congressman Garrett’s decision not to seek re-election makes it even more imperative that we select the right nominee to defeat the anti-Semitic Democrat nominee, Leslie Cockburn."\nGarrett, who represents the 5th\xa0District of Virginia, now joins the group of nearly 40 other Republicans\xa0who are not returning\xa0to Congress after the 2018 midterm elections.\nLast week, the former Virginia state senator was accused of making Congressional staffers pick up groceries, chauffer his children and clean up after his dog, according to a report in Politico.\nA spokesman, Matt Missen, said in a statement to Politico that the allegations were "unfounded".\nGarrett was set to face Democratic challenger Leslie Cockburn, who reportedly has raised more money than the Republican incumbent.\nFox News\' Mike Emanuel andThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

"If they win in San Diego or Sacramento, L.A. is next."\n\nIn San Diego County, a deputy public defender is being financially backed after fighting to keep the accused out of jail. In Sacramento and Alameda counties, candidates are challenging the incumbents. In Contra Costa County, a district attorney earned the support of the consortium of wealthy donors and liberal groups.\nFive more candidates in Marin, Riverside, San Bernardino, Stanislaus and Yolo counties are also getting donations, albeit much smaller ones, from some liberal donors.\nNoah Phillips, who’s running in Sacramento County, attacked his opponent, who happens to be his boss as well, for failing to ever charge a police officer who shot a civilian. He admitted Soros’ team scripted and paid for his ad on television, while his fundraising efforts were improved following the help from Cari Tuna, senior adviser to Bernie Sanders\' presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoros reportedly spent over $1.5 million on a political action committee to prop up the San Diego County candidacy of Geneviéve Jones-Wright, who attacked policies “criminalizing poverty” and pledged to form a police misconduct unity.\nIn total, Soros’ spending reached nearly $3 million this week on races for district attorney positions. Such large cash infusions and support for liberal groups are crucial for contenders as most elections are limited by the $800 individual contribution limit, leaving most campaigns scrambling for cash and relying on unpaid volunteers.\nThe flows of money remain unclear as federal laws allow nonprofit advocacy groups hide the source of their funding and are required to provide only a summary of their spending.\nJones-Wright\'s opponent, career prosecutor Summer Stephan, has yet to match the money donors spent against her campaign. Her $1.1 million support came mostly from police unions and other prosecutors, the Times reported.\nStephan slammed Soros’ backing for her opponent, declaring it a public safety threat. But Jones-Wright dismissed the alarmist tone, saying the funding merely gives voice to minorities and poor people who are left behind in prosecutor races.\n"I love it!" she said at a recent fundraiser, according to the Times. "If he didn\'t take an interest in this campaign, it would be an even more uneven playing field."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlameda County District Attorney Nancy O\'Malley, who’s up for re-election, was surprised to see on Soros’ target list to oust her as she’s a registered Democrat and earned endorsements from U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and other organized labor and Democratic groups.\nYet, she’s being attacked from the left, with Soros PAC accusing her of implementing “racist” stop-and-frisk policies. Her opponent, civil rights lawyer Pamela Price, promises to end such policies and blasted O’Malley for being supported by law enforcement groups.\nThe wealthy liberal donors are also getting behind Diana Becton in Contra Costa County. She was appointed district attorney of the county after her predecessor was forced to resign amid a political corruption scandal.\nHer challenger, a veteran prosecutor, slammed the support from the wealthy, saying “billionaires who apparently think Contra Costa\'s public safety is for sale.”\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Without a strong support system, Black said, young people can “go in the wrong direction” after seeking “something” on the internet or with certain friends.\n\nAs for pornography, Black didn’t explain exactly how it contributes to gun violence, but she did say it is readily accessible.\n“It’s available. It’s available on the shelf when you walk in a grocery store,” Black said. “Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there.”\n“All of this is available without parental guidance, and I think that is a big part of the root cause that we have so many young people that have mental illness get caught in these places,” she continued.\n\n\n\nBlack added that in some cases, especially with the 17-year-old\xa0shooting suspect who killed 10 people at his Texas high school earlier this month, friends were able to pinpoint a change in behavior of the teenager.\n“So I believe mental illness is something we’ve got to address. We’ve got to address the family,” she said.\xa0\nAddressing mental health issues has been something Black has advocated for in wake of recent mass school shootings. On her gubernatorial campaign website, Black said she\xa0is an advocate for gun rights and has an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association.\n“In response to mass shootings, liberals have called for banning and confiscating all guns. We must recognize mental health issues are the cause of mass gun violence, not the guns themselves,” her campaign website states.\nShannon Watts, founder of the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action, decried Black’s comments on Twitter.\n“Despite all of the data and experts at her disposal, [Black] chooses to blame ‘grocery store pornography’ for school shootings,” Watts said. “And she doesn’t mean magazines that glorify guns.”\n\nDespite all of the data and experts at her disposal, Tennessee lawmaker chooses to blame "grocery store pornography" for school shootings. And she doesn\'t mean the magazines that glorify guns. https://t.co/SQ3WARndjS— Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

But an even bluer wave is surging into the party\'s primaries this year, lifting far-left candidates over moderates\xa0— and potentially causing problems for the party\'s midterm hopes.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary after Democratic primary has featured a progressive candidate versus a moderate, with the liberal alternative often winning.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Wallace, shown with his wife, Christy, is running for Congress in Pennsylvania. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(COURTESY SCOTT WALLACE CAMPAIGN)\n\n\n\nA case study in the ascendant progressive wing was Pennsylvania’s 1st Congressional District primary race earlier this month, featuring Scott Wallace versus Rachel Reddick.\n\nReddick seemed the perfect candidate — a mother, a veteran and only 33.\n\n\'Democrats will be united as never before.\'\n- Democratic congressional candidate Scott Wallace   \n\nPolitically, however, she was seen as fairly moderate — a Republican until recently, in fact. And Wallace, a multimillionaire who had long supported liberal causes, had the backing of many local Democrats and the wherewithal to outspend his opponent.\nThe primary wasn’t close. He won by more than 20 percentage points.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Wallace proudly claimed the progressive mantle: “To me, it means values weighted toward the people, rather than corporations and the wealthy.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Wallace and FDR\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(COURTESY: SCOTT WALLACE)\n\n\n\nCLICK FOR SENATE RACE RATINGS AND FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE\nWallace, 66, has never run for office before, but, as he explains, he’s got a long political history. His grandfather, Henry Wallace, served as FDR’s vice president. And, Wallace notes, he himself has worked as staff counsel on two U.S. Senate committees and heads a foundation that attempts to bring citizens\' voices into the political debate.\nHe moved back to his home state to run because, he says, he couldn’t “sit on the sidelines this time around.” Wallace said “the most fundamental values of our American democracy are under assault as never before – a free press, an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and basic respect for truth, facts and science.”\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., speaks during the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force news conference on the release of the 2018 legislative agenda for the 115th Congress on Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(CQ Roll Call via AP Images)\n\n\n\nThe central message of his campaign is to serve “everyday people,” he said.\xa0\nHis platform, though, is squarely aligned with the party\'s left flank: Medicare for All, transitioning to renewable energy and “safeguarding Social Security from Republican assault.”\xa0\nThat worked in the primary. Whether it will work in a general election is far from certain.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolls show a close race in the general election battle against against incumbent Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick won in 2016 by 9 percentage points, but since then his district has been redrawn by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and no one is sure if it trends blue or red.\nWallace believes the previous map was gerrymandered “just enough to guarantee a Republican win ... the effect of the new map is modest — but perhaps just enough to make a huge difference.”\nWallace thinks Fitzpatrick’s record of voting with President Trump and the Republican agenda won’t play well with the electorate. He adds his opponent has cast “votes that serve his corporate donors rather than the people.”\nBut Wallace himself has been accused of being a rich man who’s out of touch with regular folks.\nSaid Team Fitzpatrick spokesperson Haley Bova:\xa0“The Lugar Center at Georgetown University ranked Brian Fitzpatrick as the No. 1 most bipartisan freshman congressman in the nation, and Scott Wallace is the most far-left extremist candidate to ever run for Congress in the history of this district. This district has zero appetite for the ultra-left extremist views of Scott Wallace and the hate groups that he has showered his millions of dollars upon."\nThe Republican National Committee cited the Pennsylvania primary among several earlier this month producing candidates who "will be unappealing to general election voters."\nWallace responds that his money allows him “to decline all corporate PAC money.” Further, he said, “I grew up here, waiting tables, pumping gas, working as a carpenter’s assistant, night manager at the Doylestown Burger Chef, and reporter for the local Bucks Country magazine.”\xa0\nFor his part, Fitzpatrick has also played up his roots in the community, as well as his service as an FBI agent.\xa0\n\n"His whole life has been about protecting our nation and serving our communities," a recent ad declares.\nAll eyes are on his district as a bellwether for whether liberal nominees help or hurt the Democratic Party in November. But Wallace doesn’t accept there’s a civil war going on within his party, as some claim.\n“Democrats will be united as never before,” he said, noting the opponents he defeated are behind him.\n“I don’t think voters care much about political labels. What they want are policies that are pro-people,” he said.\xa0\nFox News\' Kristine Kotta contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nSteve Kurtz is a producer for the Fox News Channel, and author of "Steve’s America (the perfect gift for people named Steve)".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

He’ll Make California Great Again!”\xa0\n\nCalifornia has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. On June 5th., vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man. He’ll Make California Great Again!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2018\n\n\nDemocratic\xa0Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is still the clear front-runner in the race. But Cox could advance to the general election if he secures a second-place finish next Tuesday -- thanks to the state\'s unique "jungle primary" system that advances the top two finishers regardless of party.\xa0\n\nEven a spot on the November ballot would mark a win for Republicans in the increasingly liberal state, where Democrats have controlled the legislature roughly 90 percent of the time and have held both U.S. Senate seats since 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race to replace Gov. Jerry Brown in California is seeing a surge from Republican candidate John Cox. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nHowever, winning the governorship isn’t unthinkable, considering four of the last seven governors have been Republicans dating back to Ronald Reagan in 1967.\nAn Emerson College poll released Monday shows front-running Democrat Newsom leading with support from 24 percent of likely voters, followed by Cox at 16 percent and Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa at 12. It followed another poll also showing Cox in the second-place spot in the race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown.\xa0\n\n\n\nVillaraigosa, the Los Angeles mayor, is now at risk of being shut out of the general election if Cox\'s support holds. He is considered more moderate than Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor, and remains widely popular among likely Hispanic voters.\xa0\nBut in a political twist, Newsom is launching ads against Cox -- which could have the effect of boosting the Republican\'s candidacy next week.\nOne Newsom video calls Cox a Trump “protégé” who spews “the same hateful rhetoric.” While his ads attack the GOP candidate, Newsom could be helping him with Republican voters by underscoring his ties to the president -- as he would presumably prefer to face the Republican, and not Villaraigosa, in November.\xa0\n\n\n\nCox’s closest Republican competition is state legislator Travis Allen, who finished fourth in the Emerson poll, at 11 percent.\nThe Huntington Beach-area lawmaker has also tried to align himself with the Trump agenda and this weekend appeared to bristle at Cox being endorsed by the president.\n"Cox is a Never Trumper,” Allen tweeted Monday. “I think\xa0@realDonaldTrump\xa0was misled by the establishment in Washington, DC. I fully expect my phone to be ringing\xa0on June 6, and I expect Trump to say \'We made a mistake but now we\'re fully on board, LET\'S GO TAKE BACK CALIFORNIA\' "\n\n"Cox is a Never Trumper. I think\xa0@realDonaldTrump was misled by the establishment in Washington, DC. I fully expect my phone to be ringing\xa0on June 6, and I expect Trump to say \'We made a mistake but now we\'re fully on board, LET\'S GO TAKE BACK CALIFORNIA\'" https://t.co/GWdVNOIUvb— Travis Allen (@JoinTravisAllen) May 29, 2018\n\n\nThe 62-year-old Cox, a successful Southern California businessman, is running on a pro-Trump agenda, with a top priority of ending the state’s “sanctuary” status and those of cities and counties that protect illegal immigrants from deportation.\n“Politicians like Gavin Newsom thrive on the politics of division, supporting so-called sanctuary cities just to win votes,” Cox says in a campaign ad. “Let’s end sanctuary cities now.”\nCox aligns with Trump -- whose administration in March sued California over sanctuary laws -- in arguing that limiting local law enforcement officials from helping federal immigration agents has resulted in more crime.\nCox’s other top priorities include protecting Second Amendment rights and cutting taxpayer waste, including the state’s proposed high-speed rail, which he and other critics call a “boondoggle” and “the train to nowhere.” A recent analysis shows the cost now at $77 billion, up 20 percent from roughly two years ago. He also opposes a new gas tax hike.\xa0\xa0\n“The top two issues are the state sanctuary state law … because it protects criminal illegal aliens … and the new gas tax,” Cox said last week on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier."\n“It’s crushing workers in the state,” Cox also told Fox News.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and other Republicans, at least until November, would surely be elated with Cox finishing second behind Newsom, because they desperately need a GOP candidate at the top of the state ballot this fall to bring out Republican voters. The situation is especially pressing in California congressional races, where Democrats are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into bids to swipe seven GOP-held House seats. Higher GOP turnout could help Republicans hold at least some of them.\xa0\nCox, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other California Republicans also are trying to get a gas tax repeal initiative on the November ballot, in another attempt to get GOP voters to the polls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

We thank our great Singaporean hosts for their hospitality,” Sanders tweeted Tuesday.\n\n\nUPDATE: The venue for the Singapore summit between @POTUS and Leader Kim Jong Un will be the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island. We thank our great Singaporean hosts for their hospitality.— Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) June 5, 2018\n\n\nSanders’ announcement comes after contradictory reports over the weekend on whether the U.S. would pay for Kim’s hotel in Singapore. The Washington Post reported that the U.S. was open to covering the costs for Kim’s travel.\nA White House official denied that the U.S. would pay, according to CBS News. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also denied that the U.S. would pay for the accommodations.\n“The U.S. is not paying for any accommodation costs for the North Korean delegation in Singapore,” Nauert told Fox News.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump and Kim Jong Un will meet at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island in Singapore on June 12. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summit between Trump and Kim comes after days of talks between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials.\nLast month, Trump canceled the summit following threatening language by Kim and North Koreans. The president penned a letter to Kim, notifying him of the cancellation.\nBut last week, former North Korean military intelligence official Kim Yong Chol met with Pompeo in New York City. Pompeo said he was confident that negotiations with the rogue regime were “moving in the right direction.”\nPompeo and Kim Yong Chol traveled to the White House to meet with the president, and hand-deliver him a letter from Kim.\nAfter the meeting in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters the meeting for June 12 in Singapore was back on, calling the meeting with Kim Yong Chol a “great start.”\nFox News’ Alex Pappas contributed to this report. \n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

One of his kids, Cameron, has become a\xa0March for Our Lives\xa0activist since the tragedy. But now, Kasky said, it’s the parents’ turn.\n\n“The parents who have been supporting the activist students have been supporting them in any way we can: emotional support, driving them around, giving money for gas and traveling with them,” Kasky told Fox News. “We feel we owe our children an apology for letting the situation get to where the NRA has been allowed to take over portions of our government. This is our way of expressing our need to make amends to the students.”\n\n“We feel we owe our children an apology for letting the situation get to where the NRA has been allowed to take over portions of our government. This is our way of expressing our need to make amends to the students.”\n- Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School parent Jeff Kasky\n\nKasky said he wanted to make it clear that group’s goal is not to “take away anyone’s Second Amendment rights.” He said the organization is made up of a variety of parents -- including some gun owners, such as himself.\n“We do not wish to affect the Second Amendment in any way, shape or form,” Kasky said.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of the PAC, he said, is to change the National Firearms Act of 1934 to include a ban on the most dangerous firearms. In order to do that, he said, there needs to be more likeminded lawmakers in office. “We need to get the NRA-funded politicians out of office,” he said.\nWhile the PAC will actively oppose certain NRA-backed politicians, it will not support any political candidate, Kasky said.\n“We echo the words from the March for Our Lives: ‘Either change the law or change the lawmakers.’ We plan to do both,” FAMSVARPAC said on its website.\nThe PAC encourages donations of $17, in honor of the 17 victims of the Parkland shooting.\nAccording to\xa0the Miami Herald, the super PAC registered with the federal government on May 18 -- the same day\xa010 people died\xa0in a school shooting in Texas.\nNone of the parents involved with the PAC are receiving financial compensation, Kasky said.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Ultimately, though, the deal was never sealed as members of the legal team were divided over the wisdom of letting him testify, the people said. Mr. Mueller’s office declined to comment.\nNow, a new crop of lawyers for Mr. Trump is again in an intense phase of negotiations with Mr. Mueller over the terms of a possible interview as the special counsel pursues his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign and whether the Trump campaign colluded with that effort. Mr. Trump denies collusion, and Moscow says it didn’t meddle in the election.\n\nThe discussions today are, if anything, even more difficult.\nIn April, the FBI seized records from the president’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in an investigation by the Southern District of New York that was referred in part by Mr. Mueller.\nProsecutors are examining whether the president’s lawyer committed bank fraud or campaign-finance violations. Mr. Cohen has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nMr. Trump’s legal team also has undergone a makeover, bringing a more combative style toward the Mueller investigation.

She recalled a conversation with Trump last year at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\nWard said she was with her husband and daughter and was introduced to Trump. She said he recognized her and “basically knew everything that was going on in Arizona and in the race.”\n\n“You know, he had his opinions,” she said. “He was like, \'You\'re up 15 points on Martha (McSally), and, you know, Joe shouldn\'t get\xa0in\' —\xa0he had a few other things to say about that. I\'ll\xa0keep that to myself."\nRepublican Rep. Martha McSally is on the ballot and currently represents Arizona’s second district in Congress.\nThere is clear frustration over Ward and\xa0former Maricopa County Sheriff Arpaio potentially splitting the conservative vote. Arpaio’s campaign alleged last month that Ward’s camp offered the former sheriff a job with a pro-Trump superPAC if he dropped out of the race. The Ward campaign denies it made the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArpaio, 85, said the offer was offensive. “I don’t like to be intimidated by anyone,” the former six-term sheriff said in an interview. “It’s no secret that a lot of people want me out of the race. My response is I’m not leaving.”\nArpaio, pardoned by Trump last year after being convicted of contempt of court in a racial profiling case, roiled the race in January by jumping in. He has raised only $500,000, the least among the three major Republicans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstantine Querard, an Arizona conservative strategist who has long been friendly toward Arpaio but backs Ward, told The Associated Press earlier that, “Whoever convinced Joe to run didn’t do the movement any favors because the movement has a tremendous affection for Joe, but he splits the movement.”\nThe candidates are vying for the seat held by Sen. Jeff Flake. Flake is retiring after Ward pummeled him in his initial primary. She accused Flake of being too soft on immigration and not supportive enough of Trump’s agenda.\nMcSally’s filing makes her the sixth candidate in the race across three parties. She could benefit from the tight race between Ward and Arpaio.\nThe White House press office did not respond to the paper\'s\xa0request for comment on\xa0Ward\'s account of the conversation. Ward’s campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News for comment.\nChuck Coughlin, a more centrist Arizona Republican strategist, told The AP: “He’s (Arpaio) not in it to win it, he’s just in it to keep Kelli Ward from winning.”\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nEdmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.

Bush is legally able to run for office in Virginia because of a 2016 decision by then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe to restore voting rights to thousands of felons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Larson, 37, of Catlett is running as an independent candidate in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. He has expressed pro-pedophilia and incest views, and,\xa0in an interview with HuffPo\xa0this week, called it “normal” for men to be attracted to underage women.\nLarson was barred from running in future elections after pleading guilty to sending the Secret Service a 2008 letter threatening to kill Bush, who was president at the time.\n\nBut, though a convicted felon, Larson is now able to run in Virginia because McAuliffe, the former Democratic governor,\xa0restored voting rights to 13,000 felons in 2016, including Larson\'s. McAuliffe left the governorship this year after being term-limited.\nLarson ran in 2017 for Virginia’s House of Delegates - something he would not have been able to do without McAuliffe restoring his voting rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough a convicted felon, Nathan Larson is able to run again for office because McAuliffe individually restored voting rights to 13,000 felons in 2016. McAuliffe left the governorship this year after being term-limited.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(from official site)\n\n\n\nBut the effect of McAuliffe\'s order is less clear when it comes to this year\'s contest because it is federal race. After this story was published, a spokeswoman for McAuliffe, Crystal Carson, argued that when it comes to U.S. House races, Larson is “constitutionally eligible anyway” because the U.S. Constitution doesn\'t prevent felons from serving.\n\n\n\n“McAuliffe restored his right to vote, but he could always run,” Carson said in an email to Fox News.\nAccording to the Virginia Department of Elections, candidates must be “qualified to vote” in the race for the office they are seeking.\nA spokeswoman for Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam did not immediately return a request for comment.\nAs for Larson, he hasn\'t backed away from his extreme, even repugnant views.\nLarson has written frequently on so-called “incels” -- people who have struggled with being “involuntary celibate.” HuffPo said Larson confirmed writing online posts – they\'ve since been taken down -- titled “Advantages of Father-Daughter Incest” and “The Justifiability of an Incel’s Kidnapping a Girl and Keeping Her as His Rape-Slave for Sex and Babymaking.”\nIn its story, the news organization said Larson was open about his pedophilia, but claimed he has never committed any crimes. It also uncovered an online post in which Larson expressed a desire to have sex with his daughter, though he doubted it would happen because he doesn’t have custody. He told the outlet he has a 3-year-old daughter who lives with relatives.\nAccording to Larson’s campaign platform, he is for the legalization of child pornography and restoring “benevolent white supremacy” and “patriarchy.” He also refers to Adolf Hitler as a “white supremacist hero.”\nHuffPo said Larson seemed unfazed during a phone interview.\n“A lot of people are tired of political correctness and being constrained by it,” Larson said. “People prefer when there’s an outsider who doesn’t have anything to lose and is willing to say what’s on a lot of people’s minds.”\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

Former Bill Clinton adviser, Mark Penn, gives his take.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Avenatti, the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels, reportedly sought help from liberal donors in his fight against President Trump and attorney Michael Cohen -- but was unable to secure the additional funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvenatti on Friday disputed the account, which was published in\xa0The New York Times, and claimed that -- to the contrary -- he has turned down Republican offers of financial help.\xa0\n“Never happened,” Avenatti told Fox News in an email, regarding the reported contact with liberal donors. “But what I can tell you is we have turned down over $200,000 in the last month from 3 separate republican donors looking to harm the President.”\n\nThe Times reported that Avenatti, though, contacted an official in the network of liberal groups led by Media Matters founder David Brock. The Times also reported that someone associated with Avenatti’s law firm contacted two people connected to major Democratic donors.\nBrock’s groups include Media Matters, ShareBlue, American Bridge Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and others. Last year, Brock’s network aimed to raise $40 million to fight Trump.\nAccording to the Times, the conversations did not lead to any financial help for the legal battle. Brock’s groups reportedly decided not to donate to Avenatti and Daniels, saying the legal fight was being played out in the media.\n\n\n\nAvenatti has been on a media blitz in recent months, making frequent appearances on CNN and MSNBC. This week, the federal judge presiding over the criminal investigation into Cohen, Kimba Wood, warned Avenatti he\'d have to give up his\xa0“publicity tour”\xa0if he wanted to participate in the case against Cohen.\xa0\nAvenatti, later that day, withdrew his motion to intervene—at least until the court rules whether Daniels is allowed to participate in the case.\nBut Avenatti has faced questions in recent weeks over who is financing the legal fight.\nMark Penn, former top pollster for Bill and Hillary Clinton, said last month that Avenatti should reveal who is funding him.\n“Avenatti needs to come forward with exactly who is financing his operation, who his sources were for [Cohen’s] detailed banking information, and whether he really is an attorney solely representing Stormy Daniels or just using her as cover to wage a political operation,” Penn wrote in an op-ed for The Hill.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nMark Penn questions payments to lawyer Michael Avenatti\n\n\nAvenatti slammed Penn’s comments, calling his column "ridiculous." Avenatti posted a statement saying the case is funded by Stephanie Clifford (a.k.a. Stormy Daniels) and crowdfunded donations online.\n“[N]o political party or PAC is funding this effort. No left wing conspiracy group is behind this. And no big fat cat political donors are leading the charge. Get over it,” Avenatti said last month.\nAvenatti’s personal business dealings have also come into question in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nAvenatti\'s law firm ordered by judge to pay $10 million\n\n\nHEAT ON STORMY DANIELS\' LAWYER OVER PAST BUSINESS DEALINGS, BANK RECORDS DISCLOSURE\xa0\nThe California State Bar Association has launched an investigation into Avenatti and his role in the purchase of Tully’s Coffee several years ago through an entity called Global Baristas.\nThe complaint was filed by attorney David Nold of Bellevue, Wash. The complaint says Avenatti and Global Baristas faced a lien for unpaid federal taxes worth roughly $5 million, claiming taxes were withheld from workers’ paychecks but not paid to the government. The complaint called into question Avenatti’s “fitness to practice law.”\n“The federal tax lien is related to an entity that was owned by another company that I used to have an interest in,” Avenatti told Fox News last month. “At no point in time was I ever responsible for any taxes for Global Baristas US LLC, nor was I ever a member of that entity, nor did I own any direct interest in that entity.”\xa0\nCohen’s attorneys used that complaint as an argument against Avenatti joining the federal criminal investigation as part of a grand jury probe into Cohen’s personal business dealings—including the $130,000 payment made to Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\nLast week, Avenatti and his firm Eagan Avenatti LLP were hit with court judgements ordering them to repay millions of dollars in outstanding debts.\nThe Wall Street Journal also reported Friday that in 2015, Avenatti and his wife entered a deal with casino mogul Gary Primm to buy his mansion for $15.75 million without a mortgage. The couple reportedly moved in later that year after making a $1 million deposit and agreeing to monthly payments of $900,000 toward the price. The Journal reported that two days before $14 million was due, an anonymously owned company filed notice of a lawsuit against the property, freeing Avenatti to back out of the deal.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

But this year\xa0has seen a record number of GOP lawmakers leaving Capitol Hill.\n\nSo far, 44 Republicans have either resigned, retired, been appointed to another position, lost elections or announced gubernatorial bids.\xa0\nHere’s the list of Republicans, in the House and Senate, who have announced they will not seek re-election:\nJoe Barton\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Joe Barton of Texas said he would not seek re-election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Aaron P. Bernstein)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbattled Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, announced on Nov. 30, 2017, that he was retiring from Congress.\nBarton’s announcement came after pressure for him to end his re-election bid mounted. Barton, 68, apologized\xa0after a nude photo of him surfaced on social media. He said he engaged in consensual sexual relationships while he was estranged from his second wife.\n"I’ve always listened to people in Texas and worked for them in Washington, and I’ve been listening to a lot of people the last week in Texas," Barton told the Dallas Morning News\xa0in November.\xa0"There are enough people who lost faith in me that it’s time to step aside and let there be a new voice ... so I am not going to run for re-election."\nJim Bridenstine\nRep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., promised his third term would be his last when he ran for re-election in 2015.\xa0\nAnd in April 2018, before that third term was completed, Bridenstine was confirmed by the Senate to become the newest NASA administrator, meaning the 42-year-old resigned his congressional seat.\nJason Chaffetz\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Chaffetz was a congressman from Utah.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n\n\nJason Chaffetz of Utah resigned from Congress in June 2017.\n“My life has undergone some big changes over the last 18 months. Those changes have been good. But as I celebrated my 50th\xa0birthday in March, the reality of spending more than 1,500 nights away from my family over eight years hit me harder than it had before,” Chaffetz said at the time.\nHe later signed with Fox News as a contributor. John Curtis, a Republican, won a special election in November to replace him.\nThad Cochran\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., announced on March 5 that he will resign effective April 1 because of health concerns.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Alexandre Meneghini)\n\n\n\nSen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced on March 5 that he will resign effective April 1, citing health issues.\n"I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge," Cochran said in an online statement. "I intend to fulfull my responsiblities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle."\n\nIt has been a great honor to serve the people of Mississippi and our country. pic.twitter.com/IYk3qsFxKa— Senator Thad Cochran (@SenThadCochran) March 5, 2018\n\n\nThe 80-year-old stayed home for a month last fall with urinary tract infections. He returned to Washington in October, giving Republicans the majority they needed to pass a budget plan.\nCochran has been serving in the Senate since 1978. He\'s the tenth longest-serving senator in U.S. history, according to the statement.\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant will appoint a temporary replacement. Then a special election will be held to fill the rest of the term, through January 2021.\nBob Corker\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he wouldn\'t run for a third term. His feud with President Trump has only escalated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nSen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.,\xa0announced on\xa0Sept. 27, 2017, that he will not seek a third term in 2018.\nCorker, 65, had previously said that he “couldn’t imagine” serving more than two terms. Corker has often feuded with President Trump.\nRyan Costello\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Ryan Costello, R-Pa., said he does not plan to seek re-election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Aaron P. Bernstein)\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello said in February 2018 that he would not seek re-election. Costello, 41, served in Congress since 2015.\xa0\nCostello told The Daily Local his decision not to run again was both political and personal.\xa0\n"Whether it\'s [Trump\'s rumored affair with porn star]\xa0 Stormy Daniels, or passing an omnibus spending bill that the president threatens to veto after promising to sign, it\'s very difficult to move forward in a constructive way," Costello said. "Plus, I think there\'s a lot of hate out there, from the left especially, and it\'s a very angry environment."\nCharlie Dent\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania has been openly critical of President Trump.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent first said on Sept. 7, 2017, that he would not seek re-election. But the seven-term congressman\xa0later decided that he would not finish out his term, instead electing to leave Congress by May.\xa0\n"After\xa0discussions with my family and careful reflection, I have decided to leave Congress in the coming weeks," Dent, 58, said in a April 17 statement. "It is my intention to continue to aggressively advocate for responsible governance and pragmatic solutions in the coming years."\n\nAfter discussions with my family & careful reflection, I have decided to leave Congress in the coming weeks.

He voted against party lines and a repeal of ObamaCare last year and\xa0warned the president against firing the special counsel in the Russia investigation.\nJimmy Duncan\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Jimmy Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., said he loves his family more than his job.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo)\n\n\n\nRep. Jimmy Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., announced in July 2017 that he would not seek re-election.\nIn announcing his retirement, Duncan, 70,\xa0thanked conservatives who supported him against “recent attacks against me from the far left.”\n“I have decided I wanted to spend less time in airports, airplanes and traveling around the district and more time with my family, especially my nine grandchildren, who all live in Knoxville,” Duncan said. “I love my job, but I love my family more.”\nRoll Call reported\xa0that Duncan’s sister, state Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, could launch a bid for his empty seat.\nBlake Farenthold\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, said he would not seek re-election. The House Ethics Committee is investigating sexual harassment claims against him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\n\n\nRep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, resigned from Congress on April 6, 2018.\n"While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it’s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve," he said in a statement.\xa0\nThe news came after Farenthold, 56, said in December that he was not going to to run for re-election after multiple accusations of sexual harassment, misconduct and inappropriate behavior surfaced.\xa0\nThe House Ethics Committee had said it was expanding a probe into sexual harassment allegations against the lawmaker, which would include an investigation into whether he retaliated against a former staff member for complaining of such behavior. Congressional sources said Farenthold paid an $84,000 settlement using taxpayer money.\nJeff Flake\n\n\n\n\n\nIn announcing that he would not run for re-election, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., slammed Republicans and President Trump.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\n\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., announced on Oct. 24, 2017, that he would not seek re-election. Flake is an ardent critic of Trump.\nFlake, 55, faced a tough re-election campaign in Arizona against Kelli Ward, a physician who has also challenged Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump has previously said that it was “great” that Ward was running against a “toxic” Flake.\nIn announcing that he wouldn’t run for re-election, Flake said the GOP is becoming a “backward-looking minority party.”\n“It is clear in this moment that a traditional conservative, who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free-trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has for so long defined itself by its belief in those things,” Flake said.\xa0\nTrent Franks\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., resigned after he said he made some female staffers "uncomfortable" by talking about surrogacy issues.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nArizona Rep. Trent Franks announced on\xa0Dec. 8, 2017, that his resignation would take effect immediately, despite previously announcing that he\'d leave the House in January due to sexual misconduct allegations against him.\nHe attributed the change in date to his wife\'s admittance to the hospital but reports later surfaced alleging Frank repeatedly pressed a former aide to carry his child, offering her $5 million to act as a surrogate.\nFranks’\xa0announcement came as the House Ethics Committee said it was looking into whether he “engaged in conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment.”\nFranks, 60, maintained that he never physically intimidated, coerced or had sexual contact with any member of his staff. He said he discussed surrogacy issues with some of his female staff which made them “uncomfortable.”\nThe conservative congressman said that “in the midst of this current cultural and media climate, I am deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff and noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation.”\nRodney Frelinghuysen\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Rodney Frelinghuysen was facing his first competitive re-election race in decades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n\n\nRep. Rodney Frelinghuysen said he will retire at the end of his term.\nThe New Jersey Republican, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, was facing his first competitive re-election race in decades.\xa0\nFrelinghuysen, 72, was first elected in the 1994 GOP wave that put Republicans in control of both chambers. He hails from a New Jersey political dynasty that dates to the late 1700s. His father, Peter, served in the House for two decades.\nTom Garrett\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Tom Garrett, R-Va., said he\'ll no longer seek re-election, saying he needs to work on recovering from alcoholism and renewing his commitment to his family.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\n\n\nRep. Tom Garrett, R-Va., announced on May 28 that he would not seek re-election as he battles with alcoholism.\xa0\n"Any person -- Republican or Democrat or independent -- who has known me for any period of time and has any integrity knows two things: I am a good man, and I\'m an alcoholic," Garrett, 46, said in a Memorial Day video message.\xa0\nThe announcement comes after reports of turmoil in Garrett\'s office. His chief of staff abruptly quit in May 2018, and staffers told Politico\xa0they were made into the congressman\'s "personal servants" -- running errands, picking up after his dog and being his wife\'s chauffeur.\xa0\nGarrett has been in Congress since 2017.\nBob Goodlatte\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Bob Goodlatte is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo)\n\n\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte announced on Nov. 9, 2017, that he would not seek re-election, saying it is “the right time to step aside.”\nThe Virginia lawmaker, who has been in Congress since 1993, said he has discussed whether to run for re-election with his wife, Maryellen, every two years. This year’s conversation, Goodlatte said, was different.\n“With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family, particularly my granddaughters,” Goodlatte, 65, said in a letter.\xa0\nTrey Gowdy\n\n\n\n\n\nTrey Gowdy is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Kevin Lamarque)\n\n\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy announced on Jan. 31 that he would not seek re-election or any other political office.\nThe South Carolina Republican, who until recently also sat on the House Ethics Committee, said he would be “returning to the justice system.”\n“Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” the 53-year-old said. “As I look back on my career, it is the jobs that both seek and reward fairness that are most rewarding.”\nGowdy also oversaw the divisive House investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack.\nGregg Harper\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., fought for mandatory anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for Congress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\n\n\nRep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., announced in January 2018 that he would not seek re-election at the end of his term. The House Administration Committee chairman said he tried to make Congress more transparent and accountable during his tenure.\nHarper, 61, was first elected in 2008. He said “10 years will be long enough” for him to have served in Congress.\nHarper was an ardent supporter of anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training in the U.S. House. His committee held a hearing in November 2017 regarding sexual misconduct involving current House members.\nAfter the hearing, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that the House would begin to require anti-harassment and anti-discrimination trainings for members and their staff.\xa0\nOrrin Hatch\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch\'s announcement that he would not seek re-election is largely seen as paving the way for Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, to run for the seat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\n\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is the longest serving Senate Republican. He announced on Jan. 2, 2018 – after weeks of speculation – that he would not seek re-election at the end of his term.\nThe 84-year-old said Trump told him during a recent visit to Utah that he was a “fighter.”\n“But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching,” Hatch said in a video message posted on social media.\n“I’ve authored more bills that have become law than any member of Congress alive today,” Hatch also said, adding that one of his “proudest legislative achievements” was his work with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which ensures religious freedoms are protected.\nJeb Hensarling\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said he wants to spend more time with his family.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\n\n\nRep.

Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my\xa0life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already\xa0stayed far longer than I had originally planned," Hensarling, 61, said, according to the\xa0Dallas Morning News.\nHensarling also added that he wants to spend more time with his family.\xa0\xa0\nDarrell Issa\n\n\n\n\n\nRep.

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., will retire at the end of his term, he announced on Jan. 10, 2018.\nIssa, 64, only barely won re-election in 2016. He beat his Democratic challenger, Douglas Applegate, by less than one percentage point for California’s 49th congressional district.\nThis seat was seen as a toss-up that could potentially go to a Democrat in 2018, even prior to Issa’s impending retirement. \xa0\n“Representing you has been the privilege of a lifetime,” Issa, who has been in Congress since 2001, said in a statement.\nBut Issa could come eventually return to Congress. He is reportedly considering running for Rep. Duncan Hunter’s seat, should the Republican decide to retire as well.\nLynn Jenkins\n\n\n\n\n\nThought to be a candidate for governor in Kansas, Rep.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein - RC12D3A49610\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nPresident Trump’s legal team sent a letter to Special Counsel Robert Mueller in January outlining many reasons why the president should not sit down for an interview.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFox News has obtained the letter, which offers a detailed look at the president’s legal team and its thinking about whether he should submit to an interview, including the argument that under the law and the U.S. Constitution, Mueller faces a high bar in trying to prove he needs in-person answers from the president.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)\n\n\n\nTrump attorney Jay Sekulow and then-Trump attorney John Dowd challenged Mueller to prove there were questions remaining that had not already been answered in the avalanche of documents the White House and the Trump transition team provided to Mueller.\xa0\n\nThe letter, dated Jan. 29, 2018, was titled, “Request for Testimony on Alleged Obstruction of Justice.”\xa0\n“This letter will address the recent request by our office for an interview with the president,” the letter began.\xa0\nAfter laying out the areas of inquiry that Mueller has discussed with Trump’s attorneys regarding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI Director James Comey’s firing, the president’s attorneys challenged the need for an interview, arguing that\xa0 “all of the answers to your inquiries are contained in the exhibits and testimony that have already been voluntarily provided to you by the White House and witnesses, all of which clearly show that there was no collusion with Russia, and that no FBI investigation was or even could have been obstructed.”\n\n\n\nThe attorneys also wrote that actions of the president – as the nation\'s chief law enforcement officer - “could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself.”\nSekulow and Dowd expressed their displeasure at the “encumbrance” the investigation has subjected Trump to, writing, “the special counsel’s inquiry has been and remains a considerable burden for the president and his office, has endangered the safety and security of our country, and has interfered with the president’s ability to both govern domestically and conduct foreign affairs.”\nThe White House provided tens of thousands of documents to the special counsel’s office.\xa0 Disclosures from the transition office number more than a million.\xa0 In the letter, President Trump’s attorneys noted the “unprecedented access and voluntary cooperation in the collection of all documents requested from the White House, the Donald J. Trump For President Inc., and individual witnesses.”\nThey also claimed that the two offices had “developed a collegial and professional working relationship which encourages honesty and candor.”\nThe attorneys reminded Mueller that the White House could have claimed ‘executive privilege’ over the documents, but that “the president’s desire for transparency exceeded the policy purposes for the privilege under the circumstances.”\nThe letter laid out in detail arguments as to why the president could not have obstructed justice.\nIn the Flynn case, the attorneys\' arguments included the following:\n\nThe president was not under investigation by the FBI.\nThere was no obvious investigation to obstruct since the FBI had concluded on Jan. 24, 2017, that Flynn had not lied, but rather was merely confused.\nFormer FBI Director Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, testified – under oath – that there was “no effort to impede” the investigation.\nThe Flynn investigation proceeded unimpeded and resulted in a charge and guilty plea\n\nIn the Comey case, Sekulow and Dowd pointed out that “the deputy attorney general and the attorney general both agreed, in writing, that Mr. Comey should be fired, for reasons unrelated to any investigation about Russian interference.”\nThe attorneys also referenced the Oval Office meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and comments allegedly made by the president that Comey was a “real nut job” and that “great pressure because of Russia” has been “taken off.”\xa0 Sekulow and Dowd said that if the comments as attributed were accurate, it “does not establish that the termination was because of the Russia investigation,” and that “any president would not want someone he considered a ‘nut job’ running the FBI.”\nThe attorneys concluded their letter by informing Mueller that “we have advised the president that … your inquiry thus far demonstrates that no obstruction of the Flynn investigation or Russian collusion investigation appears to have occurred.”\xa0 They also told Mueller on multiple occasions they have advised the president to decline to submit to an interview, writing the office lacked “a focused demonstration of need” for the president’s responses, which is required by law “even when there are allegations of misconduct by high-level officials."\xa0\nA source with knowledge of the investigation told Fox News the letter was intended to “push back” on Mueller’s request for an interview, “to make him work” to prove that he is lacking information about the case that can only be gleaned from an interview with the president.\xa0\nNegotiations are still ongoing between Trump\'s legal team and the special counsel’s office for an interview.\n\nJohn Roberts currently serves as the chief White House correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined the network as a senior national correspondent in January 2011, based in the Atlanta bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

It is presumably the formal response to President Trump\'s letter last week canceling the summit.\xa0\nBut since then, planning discussions have resumed, including Pompeo\'s high-level meetings these past two days in New York. Pompeo told reporters a summit in Singapore is "expected."\n\n“I am confident we are moving in the right direction,” Pompeo said, noting that both nations had teams in Singapore to prepare for a summit between Trump and Kim, which was initially slated for June 12. Trump had called it off last week in response to threatening rhetoric from the DPRK.\nPompeo said it was unclear whether the meeting would actually take place on June 12, but said that “real progress” has been made in meetings with North Korean officials this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has dinner in New York City with North Korean former military intelligence officer Kim Yong Chol. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP/Reuters)\n\n\n\n“Kim Yong Chol will travel to Washington to deliver a personal letter from Kim Jong Un,” Pompeo said, adding that the two leaders have created a “unique opportunity” to “lead into a new era of peace, prosperity and security.”\n\n\n\nA senior administration official told Fox News that the official is planning to meet with Trump at the White House Friday to hand-deliver the letter. Pompeo is expected to join in the meeting.\xa0\nTrump wrote in his letter last week that the talks would be “inappropriate” following the “hostility” from North Korea—Vice Minister of the Foreign Ministry Choe Son Hui had said that whether the U.S. “will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at a nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States,” according to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency.\nWHITE HOUSE PULLS OUT OF SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA\'S KIM JONG UN\xa0\nEarlier Thursday, the president said that it may take more than one meeting with Kim to agree on a deal to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and suspend North Korea’s nuclear program.\n“I’d like to see it done in one meeting. But oftentimes that’s not the way deals work,” Trump told Reuters. “There’s a very good chance that it won’t be done in one meeting or two meetings or three meetings. But it’ll get done at some point. It may get done really nicely and really intelligently, or it may not get done intelligently. It may have to be the hard way.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump added, though, that he believed Kim wanted to make a deal.\n“But I think it’ll get done in a very smart, organized fashion and I think that Kim Jong Un wants to see it also,” Trump told Reuters. “And I’m going to be very happy when the day arrives when we can take sanctions off, and have a very good relationship with the entire Korean Peninsula.”\nThe president added: “I look forward to seeing the letter and I look forward to June 12 where hopefully we can make progress.”\nPompeo said that if talks are successful, it will be “historic.”\n“It would be nothing short of a tragedy to let this opportunity go to waste,” Pompeo said. “We think that by working together, the [North Korean] people can create a future defined by friendship and collaboration, not by mistrust and fear and threats.”\nPompeo said that it would be a “lengthy process,” but that the administration hoped to convince North Korea that the “real threat” to its security is “the continuation of its nuclear program.” Pompeo also said he believed that North Korean leaders are looking to integrate the country into the international community.\nFox News\' Serafin Gomez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Mitch McConnell announces plans to cancel August recess\nMajority Leader McConnell announces plans to cancel most of the August recess; Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he’s canceled most of the chamber\'s traditional August recess, citing Democrats\' "obstruction" and the need to pass spending bills.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a brief written statement, he said: “Senators should expect to remain in session in August to pass legislation, including appropriations bills, and to make additional progress on the president’s nominees.”\nMcConnell\'s announcement had been expected, as he\'s faced pressure for weeks from fellow Republicans to keep members in session over the hot summer stretch.\xa0\n\nTheir appeal focused on the need to wrap up spending bills and confirm President Trump’s nominees to various positions. McConnell cited exactly that in his statement Tuesday.\xa0\n"Due to the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president’s nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year, the August recess has been canceled," McConnell said.\xa0\nBut the decision also keeps lawmakers in Washington during a critical period in the runup to November\'s midterm elections -- a controversial move.\n\n\n\nOn one hand, the recess cancellation allows senators of both parties to show they\'re working hard. But Democrats may suggest there’s an ulterior motive -- as it keeps several endangered members of their party off the campaign trail.\nRepublicans hold a narrow, 51-49 seat edge in the Senate. In a strange electoral alignment, however, the overwhelming majority of seats up for election this year are held by Democrats -- many in states President Trump won.\xa0\nSens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. and others are considered vulnerable this election cycle, and could suffer from time off the campaign trail.\xa0\nAt the same time, Congress is facing very real deadlines.\xa0\nCongress and the president must come to terms with the next round of spending before Sept. 30. Democrats and Republicans are working feverishly behind the scenes to reach an accord before then.\xa0\nBut another factor could scramble the appropriations process. Republicans recently cobbled together a “rescissions” bill, which cancels spending Congress already allocated. The administration recently sent an updated version of that plan to Capitol Hill.\xa0\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has warned that the rescissions effort “is going to make it harder to get the appropriations process moving forward in a bipartisan way.”\xa0\nSchumer said Tuesday, though, that Democrats welcome the additional time to work on urgent matters in Washington – and called on Trump to stay in D.C. along with Congress.\xa0\nNot all is lost for senators, aides and other Capitol denizens hoping to relax. McConnell\'s office said senators will likely be on a break for the first full week of August before returning for the rest of the month.\nFox News\' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Perhaps the most high-profile of those guilty pleas came from Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\nClinton, whose wife, Hillary, lost the 2016 election to Trump, is no stranger to impeachment hearings. After a lengthy investigation by independent counsel Ken Starr, the Republican-controlled House in 1998 voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in relation to the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton, however, was acquitted of both the perjury and obstruction of justice charges when the impeachment trial went to the Senate.\n\n\n\nDuring the interview with CBS, Clinton also blasted Trump for the president’s bombastic style and his use of nicknames to poke fun at political opponents. Trump labeled Florida Sen. Marco Rubio “Little Marco” and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz “Lyin’ Ted” during the 2016 campaign season, has referred to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as “little rocket man” and continues to refer to Clinton’s wife as “Crooked Hillary.”\n“I don’t like all this. I couldn’t be elected anything now \u200bbe\u200bcause I just don’t like embarrassing people\u200b,” Bill Clinton said. “My mother would have whipped me for five days in a row when I was a little boy if I spent all my time badmouthing people like this.”\nWhile the former president said that the press would have been just as “hard, or harder” in covering a Democratic president, he did defend the media against Trump habit of labelling certain news outlets as “Fake News.”\n“I think they have tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts,” Clinton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

After nearly a year and a half of holding the line, though, the leadership of the 115th\xa0Congress may be about to break.\xa0\n\n We wrote last week about the caper that the House Freedom Caucus pulled off in which they smashed a farm bill that was near and dear to House Speaker\xa0Paul Ryan’s heart. The legislation, in addition to providing the subsidies and regulations that make up the crazy quilt of American agricultural policy, included an overhaul for the food stamp program that entitlement reform crusader Ryan dearly wanted as a capstone for his soon-to-be concluded speakership.\xa0\n The 30 or so members of the caucus killed the bill as punishment for leaders not bringing forward their preferred package on addressing the matter of young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as minors. The fate of these residents hangs in limbo in the courts and in the judicial and executive branches as Congress deliberates on the subject.\xa0\n But it’s an election year and that always makes things stupider.\xa0\n\n\n\n The measure backed by the Freedom Caucus probably couldn’t pass the House and would go over in the Senate like a whoopee cushion at a screening of “Schindler’s List.” And that’s okay with them since part of the appeal is forcing their fellow Republicans to vote against a bill that would be very popular with the GOP base.\xa0\n Not only did the Freedom Caucus succeed in killing the speaker’s bill, but they have not only suffered no consequences for their extortive actions, they have been rewarded with ever-greater flattery and accommodation by the leadership team.\xa0\n At this moment, House Majority Leader\xa0Kevin McCarthy\xa0is working like a dog to avoid a repeat of 2015 when he, heir to the gavel, failed in his bid to succeed\xa0John Boehner. If the Freedom Caucus refuses his blandishments again this time, McCarthy knows he will meet the same fate. The fact that boosters of Majority Whip\xa0Steve Scalise\xa0have resumed their quiet efforts to position their man as the\xa0viable alternative\xa0to McCarthy is evidence of the majority leader’s precarious position.\xa0\n Caucus members are going to take plenty out of McCarthy’s hide for the privilege of being speaker. Now, we would rather train bees with our bare hands than have to lead this fratricidal conference. And since McCarthy would either be presiding over a substantially narrower majority or find himself as minority leader, the privilege is dubious indeed.\xa0\n While the Freedom Caucus is putting McCarthy under the lash and blowing raspberries at Ryan on his way out the door, the other 200 or so Republican members of the House are not sitting so quietly anymore.\xa0\n Any parent can tell you that when one of their children gets away with an infraction, their siblings will claim the right for themselves. If Jimmy got away with eating chocolate ice cream on mom’s good couch, you’ll pay hell keeping Johnny from doing the same.\xa0\n A group of moderate Republican House members has been circulating a petition for months that would force a vote on immigration if it gets enough signatures. It’s called a discharge petition, and while it sounds like something you would see the dermatologist about, it is one of the few ways that House members can circumvent the iron rules of leadership.\xa0\n In this case, the moderates are pushing a suite of bills that would all get a vote under House rules. The package is done\xa0Goldilocks\xa0style with one hardline stance, one permissive plan and one that moderates think will be juuuust right. Whichever one gets the most vote would automatically fly to the Senate, where members would happily pass the compromise version most likely to win in the House.\n House leadership has strongly opposed the idea. First, they know that there are enough votes to pass a plan that will be popular with the electorate in general but unpopular with Trump voters. Republicans don’t want to do anything to further dispirit their base ahead of midterms. And second, these are the kinds of uprisings that break leadership teams.\xa0\n If one discharge petition is successful, others will follow and the power of leaders to set the agenda for Congress will be eroded. Having this take place at the exact moment Ryan and McCarthy are trying to trade horses in midstream makes it even worse.\xa0\n But moderates are losing patience. In their districts inaction on the so-called DREAMers is a liability. They need to demonstrate to voters at home that they are different on the question of immigration than the president. As they have watched the Freedom Caucus get its way time and time again, these moderates have grown frustrated with leaders who take for granted their cooperation and compliance.\xa0\n The Freedom Caucus’ farm bill escapade was enough to push another handful of Republicans to sign on the line for the discharge petition, bringing them just two members from success since all of the Democrats will presumably sign on once there are requisite Republicans.\xa0\n Boehner announced his resignation on September 25, 2015. One month and four days later, he was gone. In the intervening period he moved bales of legislation against the wishes of the Freedom Caucus and many in his base. He did a spending bill, a Pentagon package and more. In hindsight it was clear that Boehner set his party up for success in 2016 by avoiding the kind of fiscal cliff shenanigans that had plagued them in the past.\n The former speaker took advantage of the element of surprise to put his tormentors back on their heels and then worked swiftly to, as he put it, “clean the stables.” Even with McCarthy’s botched bid, Boehner pulled off a remarkable feat.\xa0\n Ryan’s plan for a long twilight period looks increasingly perilous for House Republicans. What started as the usual conduct by the highwaymen in the Freedom Caucus is now spreading. This will increase the pressure on Ryan to step aside sooner.\nWhat we don’t know is whether he and McCarthy can still pull it off.\xa0  THE RULEBOOK: NOT ROCKET SCIENCE “Experience has instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet been able to discriminate and define, with sufficient certainty, its three great provinces the legislative, executive, and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches.” –\xa0James Madison,\xa0Federalist No. 37\n TIME OUT:\xa0‘THE PASSING TRIBUTE OF A SIGH’ RCP:\xa0“The discovery of the sunken wreckage of World War II casualty USS Juneau two months ago, far below the blue swells of the Coral Sea, offers poignant testimony to the rich democracy of Memorial Day. … In early November, Juneau weighed anchor in New Caledonia, in the South Pacific, and set course for Guadalcanal. A few days later, past midnight, a dozen outgunned American ships, including Juneau, intercepted a Japanese armada approaching the island to bombard its critical airfield and the beleaguered U.S. Marines garrisoned there. With two dozen ships intermingled in the darkness … four American ships were sunk; a fifth was scuttled in the morning. … Badly damaged, Juneau survived the night only to be fatally torpedoed next morning, sinking in minutes. The earthy [Sullivan brothers], the romantic [William Meeker], and all but a handful of their 700 shipmates would perish… For the [loved ones at home] they relinquished, for the never-realized homecomings and unlived summer days – all honor to them on this dawn-of-summer weekend, and as poet\xa0Thomas Gray\xa0put it, ‘the passing tribute of a sigh.’”  [Ed. note: In observance of Memorial Day, the Fox News Halftime Report will not be published on Monday. We wish for you and yours a splendid start to the summer season, but also encourage you to take time even in small and simple ways to consecrate in your own hearts the sacrifices of the nearly 1.5 million who gave their lives in war time. We would also hope that that spirit would live on the rest of the year. A long time ago a hillbilly politician said, “It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us – that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.” We will be back on Tuesday.]  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.\n SCOREBOARD Trump job performance\xa0 Average approval:\xa041.2 percent\xa0 Average disapproval:\xa054 percent\xa0 Net Score:\xa0-12.8 points Change from one week ago:\xa0down 0.6 points\xa0 [Average includes: Gallup: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; IBD: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]  Control of House Republican average:\xa041.8 percent Democratic average:\xa048.4 percent Advantage:\xa0Democrats plus 6.6 points Change from one week ago:\xa0no change\xa0 [Average includes: CNN: 47% Dems - 44% GOP; CBS News: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; Pew Research Center: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Monmouth University: 49% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP.]  COHEN HOSTED RUSSIAN OLIGARCH AT TRUMP TOWER\xa0 NYT:\xa0“Eleven days before the presidential inauguration last year, a billionaire Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin visited Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet with\xa0Donald J. Trump’s personal lawyer and fixer,\xa0Michael D. Cohen, according to video footage and another person who attended the meeting. In Mr. Cohen’s office on the 26th floor, he and the oligarch,\xa0Viktor Vekselberg, discussed a mutual desire to strengthen Russia’s relations with the United States under President Trump, according to\xa0Andrew Intrater, an American businessman who attended the meeting and invests money for Mr. Vekselberg. The men also arranged to see one another at the inauguration, the second of their three meetings, Mr. Intrater said. Days after the inauguration, Mr. Intrater’s private equity firm, Columbus Nova, awarded Mr. Cohen a $1 million consulting contract, a deal that has drawn the attention of federal authorities investigating Mr. Cohen, according to people briefed on the inquiry.”  Trump’s Lawyers, Special Counsel reaching terms on meeting -\xa0WSJ: “In January, President Donald Trump’s legal team and special counsel\xa0Robert Mueller\xa0were zeroing in on the terms of a presidential interview: the last Saturday of the month, at Camp David, on a narrow list of topics, for maybe between two and six hours, with time set aside for bathroom breaks, according to people familiar with the matter. The lawyers presented the terms to the president, who was described by one person as ‘optimistic’ about the prospect. Ultimately, though, the deal was never sealed as members of the legal team were divided over the wisdom of letting him testify, the people said. Mr. Mueller’s office declined to comment.”\n Giuliani doesn’t seem to be as on board with the plan -\xa0The Hill: “Rudy Giuliani\xa0said Thursday that President Trump is more likely to move forward with talks with North Korean leader\xa0Kim Jong Un\xa0than he is to sit for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller. ‘I think it is more inevitable than a Mueller interview,’ Giuliani, a member of Trump\'s legal team, told The Washington Post. ‘At least they’re not going to try to trap him into Korean perjury.’ Giuliani\'s comments came after Trump on Thursday canceled a planned summit with Kim that was set to take place on June 12 in Singapore.”\n Manafort trial pushed to July 24 -\xa0Reuters:\xa0“A trial date for U.S. President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager,\xa0Paul Manafort, for alleged financial crimes been postponed to July 24 in the Eastern District of Virginia District Court, according to a court filing on Friday.\xa0The judge said the cause of the postponement from July 10 was ‘owing to a family member’s medical procedure.’ Manafort, along with his business associate\xa0Richard Gates, was indicted in the Virginia court for charges related to false income tax returns, failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts and bank fraud.”\n McConnell stands behind special counsel investigation -\xa0NPR: “Senate Majority Leader\xa0Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told NPR in an interview that he continues to support the Mueller Russia investigation — and that nothing in Thursday\'s hotly anticipated secret briefing on the Russia probe to congressional leaders changed his mind. ‘The two investigations going on that I think will give us the answers to the questions that you raise — the [inspector general] investigation in the Justice Department and the Mueller investigation,’ McConnell said. ‘I support both of them, and I don\'t really have anything to add to this subject based upon the Gang of Eight briefing that we had today, which was classified.’”\n Former Trump campaign adviser sought Clinton dirt from WikiLeaks -\xa0WSJ: “Former Trump campaign adviser\xa0Roger Stone\xa0privately sought information he considered damaging to\xa0Hillary Clinton\xa0from WikiLeaks founder\xa0Julian Assange\xa0during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The emails could raise new questions about Mr. Stone’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in September, in which he said he ‘merely wanted confirmation’ from an acquaintance that Mr. Assange had information about Mrs. Clinton, according to a portion of the transcript that was made public.\xa0In a Sept. 18, 2016, message, Mr. Stone urged an acquaintance who knew Mr. Assange to ask the WikiLeaks founder for emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal in 2011 when she was secretary of state, referring to her by her initials.”\n EX-STAFFERS DESCRIBE HUMILIATIONS IN HILL OFFICE\xa0 Politico:\xa0“Virginia Rep.\xa0Tom Garrett\xa0and his wife turned the congressman’s staff into personal servants, multiple former employees to the freshman Republican told POLITICO — assigning them tasks from grocery shopping to fetching the congressman’s clothes to caring for their pet dog, all during work hours. POLITICO has spoken with four former staffers who detailed a deeply dysfunctional office in which the congressman and his wife,\xa0Flanna, often demanded that staff run personal errands outside their typical congressional duties. The couple called on staff to pick up groceries, chauffeur Garrett’s daughters to and from his Virginia district, and fetch clothes that the congressman forgot at his Washington apartment. They were even expected to watch and clean up after\xa0Sophie, their Jack Russell-Pomeranian mix, the aides said. The staffers said they feared that if they refused Garrett’s or his wife’s orders — both were known for explosive tempers — they would struggle to advance in their careers. It wasn\'t just full-time staff: many of the allegedly inappropriate requests were made of interns, the former aides said.”\n After Franken scandal, GOP sees opening in Minnesota -\xa0Fox News:\xa0“A combination of changing political views and Democratic turmoil has Republicans seeing red in the once-liberal stronghold of Minnesota, where a tossup governor’s race has given the party hope and could serve as a bellwether for future elections. ‘In 2018, we want to turn Minnesota red and in 2020 deliver Minnesota’s 10 electoral votes for President Trump for the first time since the state voted for Nixon [in 1972],’ Minnesota Republican Party Chairwoman\xa0Jennifer Carnahan\xa0told Fox News. ‘The election in November will be a tipping point for our state for possibly many decades.’ Despite the state’s solid-blue record in past presidential elections, Hillary Clinton narrowly won Minnesota over President Trump by just 1.5 percentage points in 2016. Republicans now control both chambers of the state legislature. And the Democratic Farmer Labor Party—as it’s known in Minnesota—suffered a hit to the brand after\xa0Al Franken\xa0resigned from the Senate amid accusations of sexual harassment. The resignation also left voters to decide two U.S. Senate races this year, in additional to the likely competitive gubernatorial contest.”\n Poll shows Menendez barely ahead in N.J, Senate race -\xa0Politico:\xa0“Sen.\xa0Bob Menendez\xa0holds a razor-thin four-point lead over his likely Republican rival in November’s general election, according to a new poll, indicating the New Jersey Democrat is still suffering from a post-corruption-trial hangover. Menendez, who successfully beat back federal bribery charges only to face a bipartisan admonishment by the Senate Ethics Committee, has the support of 28 percent of registered voters in his reelection bid, according to the latest survey from Fairleigh Dickinson University. The likely Republican nominee, former pharmaceutical executive\xa0Bob Hugin, recorded support at 24 percent among the 856 people surveyed.”\n Perez feels heat after endorsing Cuomo -\xa0The Hill: “Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman\xa0Tom Perez\'s endorsement of New York Gov.\xa0Andrew Cuomo\xa0has created a fissure with his deputy, Rep.\xa0Keith Ellison\xa0(D-Minn.), who learned of the party leader\'s decision to get involved in the race only after a public announcement. In a statement, Ellison said the DNC should not get involved in primary fights such as the one in New York, where Cuomo is facing a spirited challenge from the left from actress-activist\xa0Cynthia Nixon. … Perez defeated Ellison in a contested race last year for the party chairmanship that shined a spotlight on the divisions within the party between more centrist and liberal lawmakers. Perez\'s endorsement broke from his repeated pledge not to pick favorites in the party\'s primary races.”  Dem drops out of Iowa governor race over sex misconduct charges -\xa0Des Moines Register: “Iowa Democratic candidate for governor\xa0Nate Boulton\xa0suspended his campaign Thursday morning, the day after the Des Moines Register published allegations from three women that Boulton touched them sexually without their consent. ‘I am so proud of the campaign that my staff, my supporters, and I ran in the past year,’ Boulton said in a statement. ‘I was and still am inspired every day by the people who have chosen to fight alongside me in the Senate and on the campaign trail to share a positive vision forward for this incredible state of Iowa.’”  PLAY-BY-PLAY House passes $717 billion defense policy bill\xa0-\xa0AP  Ivanka also gains full security clearance\xa0-\xa0Axios  Environmental red tape stalls border agents trying to fill drug-smuggler tunnels\xa0-\xa0Fox News  AUDIBLE: TOTES “I enjoyed it, actually.

Watch #mediabuzz Sundays at 11 a.m. ET.  FROM THE BLEACHERS “You ask ‘what could be sadder than coerced patriotic expression?’ My question back to you is: ‘What’s coerced if a dissenting player is allowed to remain in the locker room?’ His salary remains untouched. More importantly to the many Americans (including me) who have served in the Armed Forces, we don’t have to witness someone being disrespectful to the flag we fought for. These players, 99.99% of whom have not served their country, simply do not understand why I and my veteran and active duty comrades find their behavior extremely distasteful.\xa0 It matters not that they claim they’re not protesting the military—kneeling during the National Anthem offends the men and women who’ve put their lives on the line for this country.” –\xa0Charles Ware, New Bern, N.C.  [Ed. note: I hear you, Mr. Ware. And I also thank you for your service. We owe all of our freedoms to men and women who would lay down their lives for their brothers and sisters. As the saying goes: Land of the free because of the brave. What I wonder, though, is why anyone would want a phony, forced show of respect from someone who was just doing it for the money? I despair at the idea that even our national anthem has become a political battle. It is unworthy of a great country and, as you say, the men and women who have sacrificed to create and maintain it. But if our culture has eroded to the point that even this most basic form of civic participation has become a weapon, no set of rules or regulations will save us from our deserts.]  “Players and all Americans have a right to express themselves – it is what makes this country great – but there is a time and place for said expressions. And while you are on the clock at work is not the place.\xa0 Once a sports figure takes the field for a game, they are now on the job. While I do not agree with stances taken by the players, I would whole-heartedly endorse their right to express themselves on their free time. Moreover, sports figures should also consider the ramifications of their actions where they are on the field. My wife is a teacher and one Monday morning fresh off a weekend of NFL protests, two of her second-grade students didn’t not stand for the Pledge of Allegiance. All they did was laugh because they wanted the attention of the other students and didn’t understand why the players did what they did. Keep up the great work. Your style of writing is fresh and witty!” –\xa0Dave Shuey, Berne, Ind.  [Ed. note: Yup! But to be fair to the protesters, the NFL and its advertisers have been remarkably successful at monetizing patriotism. Pro sports and patriotism have been tangled together from the start, but the NFL has wrapped itself in the flag to a pretty remarkable degree. That’s why the activists went there.]\xa0\xa0\xa0  “I found this comment in today\'s Halftime Report touching a nerve. … 1) Sitting/Kneeling at a National anthem does not in any way disrespect the anthem. Who came up with ‘Standing is respectful’ anyway? I kneel when I pray to the Lord and prostrate on the floor when I want to completely submit to a higher power. Isn\'t that a higher form of respect than standing?\xa0 2) On the Flag - This was the same flag that was a symbol of slavery, women\'s suffrage, systematic racism against Asians and the most grave crime of all - Native American genocide. White men have enjoyed the full freedoms for the longest period in our history. So please be gentle on the folks who don\'t enjoy the same freedoms and want to get to a more perfect Union. As for the means to this end, who is anyone to tell another where, when and how to protest? The flag and the anthem are mere symbols they are as good as any to focus our attention on issues. Cohesion and unity comes when we talk about issues and fix them. Not this coerced patriotism, that\'s good for North Korea.” –\xa0Jai Suresh, Milpitas Calif.  [Ed. note: Good advice, Mr. Suresh. But I would also say that a culture is like a family. We have to find enough love for each other to summon forgiveness for each other. It is always tempting to tell the American story with bright, bold strokes. The truth, as is usually the case in history, is more complicated. But I know in my heart and in my head that United States of America has been perhaps the greatest single force for good in the history of our civilization. Our sins and transgression are numerous and we should not shrink from them. But we would do a disservice to those who came before us if we allow the failures of the past to interfere with our gratitude for the many gifts God has given us.]  “Mr. Stirewalt: I was pleased to see you shift Kentucky\'s 6th District from a ‘Lean Republican’ to ‘Likely Republican’ in the latest Power Rankings.

Andrew Cuomo fired a top agency official Wednesday after an investigation corroborated sexual misconduct allegations, a report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJay Kiyonaga, second-in-command at the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, was fired after allegations of “improper and sexually inappropriate acts” toward female subordinates were substantiated, state Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott said in a letter to the agency, the New York Post reported.\n“The specific acts and pattern of conduct described to my office under oath — ranging from inappropriate sexual comments and comments about employee’s sexual preferences to an unwanted sexual physical contact with an employee — are reprehensible and indefensible,” Leahy said.\n\nThe fired official, who used to be in charge of the Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs, was accused of sexual harassment last year by Patricia Gunning, a former prosecutor and inspector general for the Justice Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatricia Gunning first accused Jay Kiyonaga of sexual harassment last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(LinkedIn)\n\n\n\nShe said Kiyonaga retaliated against her after she complained about his behavior and forced her resignation. Gunning then went to Melissa De Rosa, Cuomo’s top deputy, who referred her complaints about Kiyonaga to the IG’s office and prompted an investigation.\nAccording to the Inspector General’s letter, a woman who worked under Kiyonaga testified that he tried “sexual physical contact” during one after-work meeting at a bar in 2015. She also said he would openly talk about “dreams that he had that were of a sexual nature involving staff members.”\n\n\n\nAnother woman reportedly said the now-fired official once “reached out and kind of caressed my leg to feel the fabric” – an incident witnessed by at least six other staff members.\nOn another occasion he asked the woman if she knew the definition of a vulgar term. Other female staffers said the official used to talk admiringly about parts of their bodies.\nGunning, who filed a sex discrimination suit against the Justice Center and Kiyonaga with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, also recalled inappropriate behavior by the official, saying he often turned the conversation into “something sexual.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe once pointed out to her that she had “a real knack for picking hot girls for [her] team,” and that had “heard that one person on my staff was bisexual and he wanted to know if I knew that and wasn’t it hot.”\nFollowing the decision to fire Kiyonaga, Gunning celebrated the move through her lawyer, saying: “MeToo has finally arrived in New York State government.”\n“For years, Ms. Gunning felt ostracized and alone as she suffered sexual discrimination and retaliation at work.\xa0 Today, she is vindicated. We urge every single victim of Mr. Kiyonaga’s misconduct to come forward and share their experience,” Ilann Maazel told the Post.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

The National Border Patrol Union called Trump\'s deployment to the border this year a \'waste,\' despite earlier supporting the move.\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(Reuters)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nThe president of a union that represents U.S. Border Patrol personnel now says that President Donald Trump\'s decision last month to\xa0send National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border\xa0has been "a colossal waste of resources."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"We have seen no benefit," said Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council,\xa0the Los Angeles Times reported.\nThe comments were a marked departure for the union, which represents approximately 15,000 agents. The group endorsed Trump during his run for the presidency and previously voiced support for his border policies.\n\nEarlier this week, for example, Judd defended Trump\'s decision to call MS-13 gang members "animals,"\xa0telling Fox News\xa0that\xa0"they\'re worse than animals, in my opinion."\n\n"We generally support the administration, but we\'re not going to be cheerleading when things are not going well."\n-  Brandon Judd, president of National Border Patrol Council\n\nAnd in January, Judd\xa0appeared in a White House video\xa0praising Trump, saying "thank you, Mr. President" and declaring that "the Trump administration has accomplished more in one year to secure our border than any other president."\nNearly 1,600 National Guard troops have been sent to the border, and\xa0Trump has said last month he wants to send between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard troops in total to crack down on the “lawlessness that continues” there.\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the National Border Patrol Council cheer for President Trump during Election Day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\xa0vowed in April\xa0that the National Guard\'s mission would continue until a border wall could be established.\nWATCH: NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS SUPPORT BORDER PATROL AGENTS\n“Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” Trump said. “That\'s a big step, we really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.”\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nBrandon Judd Backs Trump\'s Remarks on MS-13 Members\n\n\nInitially, Judd said, the president\'s plans led to a sense of optimism.\n"When I found out the National Guard was going to be on the border I was extremely excited," Judd told the Los Angeles Times.\nJudd said the positive result from previous National Guard deployments to the border, such as those ordered by former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, "has not happened at all" this time around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring deployments in 2014 and 2010, Judd said, National Guard troops "were allowed to do a lot more than they are under the Trump administration. They were allowed to be in lookout and observation posts. They were allowed to be out grading the roads and mending fences. They were allowed to be our eyes and ears, freeing us up."\nBut this time, according to Judd: "They\'re not allowed to be in the public eye. They\'re not allowed to be in our lookout and observation posts, even in Texas.\nBORDER PATROL AGENT REPORTEDLY SHOOTS, KILLS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN TEXAS\n"We generally support the administration, but we\'re not going to be cheerleading when things are not going well," he added.\nIn Washington, Trump administration officials say the deployment is still in its initial stages -- and has been far more effective than Judd claims.\n"While the National Guard deployment has not yet reached full capacity, it has clearly and unquestionably been a success with thousands of additional apprehensions and millions of dollars of drugs kept out of our country," Katie Waldman, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, told the Los Angeles Times. "The third request for assistance to deploy additional Guardsmen in support of the mission to secure the southern border was recently authorized and is being implemented. More help is on the way."\nFederal law restricts National Guard troops in federal service from performing law enforcement activities, but they can when operating under state authority and are permitted to assist Border Patrol officers with certain law enforcement functions.\n\xa0\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

Osborn reportedly suffered a medical emergency while on duty. He served at the North Beach Fire Department for 18 years.\n“Not only was it a death of one of our members that’s been around here for a very long time, but it was a line of duty death so it makes it that much more emotional,” Keller told FOX 5. “I just thought it was very distasteful and so did everybody else that came out and found it on their car.”\n\nEtienne Jr. is reportedly the chaplain for the Baden Volunteer Fire Department in Prince George’s County.\nEtienne Jr., according to his campaign website, pledged that “success” in his campaign would require “strong and organized grassroots organization” including “vigorous door to door canvassing.”\nBut Osborn’s family and friends have reportedly taken to Etienne’s Facebook page to express their displeasure with campaigning at the Osborn memorial service.\xa0\n\n\n\n“I think anybody with any kind of common sense wouldn’t do it at a funeral or anything where anybody’s emotions are very high,” Keller told FOX 5. “I couldn’t believe it because it is just in very poor taste.”\xa0\nEtienne Jr. will compete in the Maryland primary on June 26.\nEtienne Jr. did not respond to FOX 5’s request for comment.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

I\'m worried about all the people out there who don\'t have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarr apologized for the tweet, and has since seen her rebooted “Roseanne” comedy series canceled and perhaps become a permanent Hollywood pariah.\nJarrett, on the other hand, apparently saw a political opportunity.\n\nHow can we cultivate civility in our government and in our society at large? Read this special note to OFA supporters from @ValerieJarrett and find out where we can start: https://t.co/IqlMbzpjOI— OFA (@OFA) June 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nHer name now appears at the bottom of a please-pledge-to-vote email distributed by Organizing for Action, Obama’s nonprofit political organization.\n“There are days when we\'re reminded so clearly that we have not yet reached our destination, and that is why we have to work every day to treat our fellow citizens with dignity and civility,” Jarrett’s email says, without mentioning Barr.\nThe message quickly pivots to politics.\n“The culture that we\'re creating and the interactions we have with our fellow citizens each day,” Jarrett writes, “are influenced by those who we elect to represent us.\n\n"The culture that we\'re creating and the interactions we have with our fellow citizens each day are influenced by those who we elect to represent us."\n- Valerie Jarrett, in email for Organizing for Action\n\n“When we elect people that continually demean others [Jarrett’s italics] -- those of another race, or religion, or gender, or identity, or sexual orientation -- and reach for an America in the past instead of one in the future, the results hurt us all,” she writes.\nAgain, Jarrett does not mention any names.\nAt the end of the email comes the so-called “Big Ask.”\n“Say you’ll vote in 2018,” Jarrett writes.\nAt the bottom of the message there’s an “I will vote” click box. When it’s clicked on, it leads to a page that requests the reader’s email address and ZIP code, implying future messages from Organizing for Action.\n“Commit to vote, right now,” the sign-up box says.\nWhat commitments might be requested later are not mentioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Kennedy Jr. says he is not convinced the man behind bars for killing his father is the man responsible.\n\n\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. revealed he doesn’t believe Sirhan B. Sirhan, the man convicted of killing his father Bobby Kennedy in 1968, had carried out the assassination and believes a second shooter was involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post published Saturday, Kennedy said he met with Sirhan for three hours after spending months reviewing autopsy results, police reports and interviewing witnesses who was there when his father was killed. It’s been nearly 50 years since Bobby Kennedy was killed in Los Angeles’ Ambassador Hotel, but the 64-year-old said he reached a point where he had to talk to the man convicted of killing his father.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said he doesn\'t think Sirhan Sirhan shot his father in 1968 and believes there was a second gunman that pulled the trigger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\n“I went there because I was curious and disturbed by what I had seen in the evidence,” Kennedy said, not disclosing details of their conversation. “I was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father. My father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country.”\n\nHe added, “I think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn’t commit.”\nSirhan had admitted during his 1969 trial to shooting the then-Democratic presidential candidate, but repeatedly said he didn’t remember pulling the trigger. An autopsy report also showed Bobby Kennedy was shot in the back — when Sirhan was standing in front of him.\nReports through the years also indicated 13 shots were fired that day when Sirhan’s gun only held eight bullets. Several witnesses said Sirhan wasn\'t close to the senator.\xa0\n\n\n\nKennedy is now supporting a call for a reinvestigation into his father’s assassination. His doubts of Sirhan, who is serving life in prison, killing his father follows the belief that a second shooter was also at the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\nSirhan Sirhan was convicted of assassinating Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy in 1968.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nPaul Schrade — who was shot in the head while walking behind Bobby Kennedy — said he also thinks Sirhan didn’t shoot the politician. He believes Sirhan’s bullets hit him and four others wounded that day.\n“Yes, he did shoot me. Yes, he shot four other people and aimed at Kennedy,” Schrade told the Washington Post. “The important thing is he did not shoot Robert Kennedy. Why didn’t they go after the second gunman? They knew about him right away. They didn’t want to know who it was. They wanted a quickie.”\nSchrade, 93, had convinced Kennedy, a lawyer and environmental activist, to look into the assassination after showing him the autopsy report. Kennedy, the third oldest of 11 children, was 14 when his father was killed.\nThe court has refused to open a new investigation into the assassination, the Washington Post reported. Sirhan’s appeals have been rejected multiple times, including as recently as 2016. \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nSirhan Sirhan pleads his case during his tenth parole hearing at the Corcoran State Prison June 18, 1997.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nOther members of the Kennedy family did not comment on the report.\nThis isn’t the first time Kennedy has backed a controversial theory. He argued last year that certain vaccines were unsafe for children.\n\nKatherine Lam is a breaking and trending news digital producer for Fox News.

Garrett denies resignation rumors - McConnell sets stage for 2019 spending - Oops!   OH SAY CAN YOU SEE, OR ELSE The stories are so common that they start to run into each other.\xa0  This time it takes place at Mount Holyoke College, an elite women’s school in Western Massachusetts. House Minority Leader\xa0Nancy Pelosi\xa0was addressing the graduating class last weekend, but one of the graduates,\xa0Kassy Dillon, dissented.  Dillon adorned her mortarboard with political stickers and pins for her preferred causes, which, as a member of the school’s College Republicans, included a Trump-Pence bumper sticker. When she stepped forward to receive her diploma, Dillon\xa0got booed.\xa0  Now, being an outspoken conservative activist at a famously liberal school, Dillon is no doubt accustomed to getting blowback from her classmates, but at graduation? Boo, indeed.\xa0  Out in Oregon,\xa0we have the case\xa0of a student at a high school in suburban Portland who suspended for refusing to cover his\xa0“Donald J. Trump Border Wall Construction Co.” t-shirt in class.  Back in New York is the story of the guy who said he was\xa0refused service\xa0at a Greenwich Village bar because he was wearing a MAGA hat.  Whether they admit it or not, many Trump supporters love these stories. They are evidence that, despite all of the rhetoric about how\xa0President Trump\xa0is intolerant, divisive and cruel, it’s really his opponents who are the bigots. Imagine being able to support the majority party and the president in power and still getting to feel like an insurgent fighting oppression. Talk about double coupons.  We have some experience with this kind of thing ourselves. A hallmark of Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies was the audience-participation portion in which candidate Trump urged his supporters to show their disdain for the press loudly. Reporters and producers sat in the back of event halls penned like stoats as Trump supporters spewed their rage, sometimes profanely, at them. Before, during and after events, heckling the press was just part of the fun for some Trump supporters.\xa0  It was scary for reporters sometimes and more than a little uncomfortable feeling. But it was also affirming in a strange way. Covering an ordinary campaign rally where reporters are treated like VIPs and celebrities doesn’t exactly give one the sense of guerrilla journalism. But doing it in the face of hooting mobs at rallies that had seen outbursts of violence made our work seem newly vital and virtuous.\xa0  That’s not to take anything away from Dillon or others who have been subjected to the boorish behavior of their peers and superiors over their political views. And to her credit, Dillon seems to be using the incident to further her own activism, not to seek sanctions against the offenders. And given the width of the streak of intolerance for opposing views in academia, she’ll have plenty to work with.  But in the other two cases, the responses have been different. The aggrieved Trump-attire wearers took their cases to federal court to fight for their right to offend the sensibilities of their fellows. In the case of the man who wore the MAGA hat to the bar in one of the most liberal enclaves in the country, his lawyer told a federal judge that MAGAing was part of his religion and that by forbidding him service, the saloon keeper was violating the man’s civil rights.\xa0  Pffffttttt…  Out in Oregon, the student and his family alleged that the government was trampling the young man’s freedom of expression since a state-run school was forbidding him to express his political opinions.\xa0  Since when was defying schools’ ability to regulate the attire and conduct of their students considered a tenet of Republicanism? It is not at all unreasonable for administrators to try to keep electioneering and politically charged conduct out of its classrooms and halls.\xa0  Maybe your mother used to tell you “don’t make a federal case out of it.” She was probably speaking figuratively about your overreaction to a minor discomfort, but the proviso applies literally in these cases.\xa0  Who would want to be a patron at a place where they were unwelcome? How would the beer taste poured by a bartender compelled by a federal judge to draw the pint? One imagines it would taste a little better than the wedding cake prepared by a baker forced by the state into preparing dessert for a ceremony they find morally objectionable.\xa0  This, of course, brings us to compulsory demonstrations of patriotism.\xa0  In a decision that only the NFL could come up with, the league has codified its rules about the national anthem.\xa0  Players who are on the field when “The Star-Spangled Banner” is preformed will be required to stand, those who object may remain in their locker rooms during the patriotic display.\xa0  We sympathize with the franchise owners who have been caught out after many years of profitable patriotism. The league makes big bank off of your pro-American tingles, which is why players protesting police brutality went after the anthem.\xa0  It’s also why Trump went after the players. He and his administration know well that anytime they can force their opponents to defend not standing for the national anthem or the humanity of murderous gang members or the legitimacy of Hamas it’s a political win.\xa0  Trolling may not be pretty, but it works in the era of perpetual outrage. But for anyone who is tempted to celebrate grown men being compelled to express their patriotism for the sake of their paychecks, they ought to think twice.\xa0  Now, we should bear in mind that employers are well within their rights to set requirements for their employees. The NFL is not the government, even if, in this case, it was acting on the demand of the government’s chief magistrate.\xa0  It is sad indeed that even the anthem has become a political weapon and sadder still that there are those who believe the song is an appropriate vehicle for protest. Disrespecting America to get attention for a political cause erodes the very cohesion we need to solve the problems the protestors say need to be addressed.\xa0  But what could be sadder than coerced patriotic expression? Now, this isn’t a North Korean reeducation camp. These men would be freed to forgo their valuable contracts to avoid being made a spectacle of, but it is coercion all the same.  The First Amendment may come at the top of the bill of rights, but it is a liberty that can only prosper within an otherwise functional society. Freedom of expression is a right not a privilege, but it is a right that corrodes the others if it is exercised in a society that lacks trust, respect and recognition of mutual humanity.\xa0  We are doing a poor job at those things these days and find ourselves now at a time where both sides seek limits to free expression, sometimes out of spite alone.\xa0  Dillion knew what to do about those who disrespected her: Rise above the insult and use the moment to advance her cause. Can her elders learn the same lesson?  THE RULEBOOK: AU NATUREL “The natural strength of the people in a large community, in proportion to the artificial strength of the government, is greater than in a small, and of course more competent to a struggle with the attempts of the government to establish a tyranny.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28  TIME OUT:\xa0LIVE AND IN STEREO New Yorker: “There’s a special thrill of liberation in the live recordings of jazz that few studio recordings can match. Resonance Records … on May 25th, [will release] three concert recordings of the guitarist Grant Green that had been buried in archives for more than forty years. The first two are on the two-disk set ‘Funk in France: From Paris to Antibes (1969-1970),’ and come from France’s audiovisual archive; the third, ‘Slick!—Live at Oil Can Harry’s,’ was recorded in Vancouver, in 1975, by a Canadian radio station; and both albums offer revelatory delights. … The importance of these new Resonance releases of Green’s live performances is something of a paradox, because several of the most popular items in Green’s discography are concert recordings from the early nineteen-seventies. Those recordings also mark a switch in idiom, featuring tight funk rhythms in lieu of the freewheeling swing of Green’s jazz modernity of the sixties. Green’s playing was narrower and riffier on those live recordings than in his earlier classic-jazz records.”  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.

The noon meeting included White House Chief of Staff John Kelly; Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein; FBI Director Christopher Wray; Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.; House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.; Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. That meeting is ongoing. A second meeting, scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, is expected to include Kelly, Rosenstein, Wray, Coats, Gowdy, Republican and Democratic leaders from both the House and Senate, as well the top lawmakers from their intelligence panels. The announcement of a second meeting came after criticism from Democrats who said the briefing should have been given to a bipartisan group of ‘Gang of 8’ lawmakers -- as opposed to just Nunes and Gowdy, as initially scheduled.”  Trump campaign aide set for sentencing - WaPo: “A federal judge agreed Wednesday to begin the process of preparing to sentence George Papadopoulos, a former adviser to President Trump’s 2016 campaign, an initial move toward wrapping up one phase of the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about Russian contacts during the campaign and has been cooperating with the investigation. In the filing Wednesday, prosecutors with the special counsel’s office asked the judge to refer Papadapoulous’s case to U.S. probation officials to prepare a pre-sentencing report — the first step to bringing his case to a close. They indicated that they would update the court on that process on June 22.”  The Judge’s Ruling: Interference on the play - This week, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks whether the president can lawfully investigate his investigators: “The president cannot interfere with criminal investigations against himself without running the risk of additional charges of obstruction of justice -- interference with a judicial process (the gathering of evidence and its presentation to a grand jury) for a corrupt purpose (impeding his own prosecution or impeachment). Nor can members of Congress see whatever they want in the midst of a criminal investigation, particularly if they might share whatever they see with the person being investigated. … Can the president investigate his investigators? Yes -- but not until the investigation of him is completed. That\'s because no one can fruitfully examine the legitimacy of the origins of the case against Trump without knowing the evidence and the charges. Trump\'s allegations are of extreme scandal… Yet if he is exonerated, those allegations will lose their sting.” More\xa0here.  REP. GARRETT DENIES RESIGNATION RUMORS Roll Call: “Asked about Wednesday reports that he would not be running for re-election, Virginia Rep. Tom Garrett would only say he has no plans to leave Congress before the end of the session. ‘I’m not resigning. I can tell you that definitively,’ Garrett told Roll Call. Garrett said his office would be putting out a statement soon. Politico first reported Wednesday afternoon that Garrett, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, had ‘abruptly parted ways’ with chief of staff Jimmy Keady and was considering retiring. Garrett, a former state senator, was elected to Virginia’s 5th District in 2016 by a 17-point margin. President Donald Trump carried the 5th District by 11 points. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the 2018 race Likely Republican. Democrats have made this district a target. Former journalist Leslie Cockburn won the nomination at a party convention earlier this month. Garrett’s retirement would open up a crowded GOP field. One Republican in the state named Del. Nick Freitas, who’s currently running for Senate, as a likely top contender.”  Cuomo finds base in party’s nominating convention - NY Daily News: “State Democrats came out overwhelmingly for Gov. [Andrew Cuomo] at the party\'s nominating convention Wednesday, as New York Republicans gathered to back Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro for the state\'s top job. The incumbent governor, who faces a challenge from the left by actress Cynthia Nixon, looked like the odds-on favorite, winning more than 95% of the party members\' votes. Since announcing her candidacy in March, Nixon has been positioning herself as the progressive alternative to the party machine. The Dems\' convention at Hofstra University in Hempstead, L.I., however, was Cuomo\'s show. Two ministers who gave the convention\'s opening prayer spent more time talking up Cuomo than they did God. Hillary Clinton gave a full-throated endorsement of the incumbent governor, 60, and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, 59, who was nominated by the party for a second term.”  Another House hopeful will not support Pelosi if elected - New Jersey Globe: “Congressional candidate Mikie Sherrill announced that she would not vote House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi into a House leadership position if she was elected to fill retiring Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen’s seat. … The move could be a play to win over liberal Democrats who might be put off by the institutional support Sherrill has received in the race. … Since Sherrill’s biggest primary challenge comes from the left, through social worker Tamara Harris, support from otherwise disaffected Democrats could prove valuable come June 5. But, it might be more helpful if Sherrill had picked a torchbearer to replace Pelosi, who has led House Democrats for 15 years.”  Texas feels surge of female candidates - Politico: “A groundswell of female candidates in Texas has resulted in a record number of women on the ballot in November — and a guarantee that the state will have at least two new female members of Congress next year. With the state primary and runoffs now completed, the general election will also feature twice the number of women as in 2016 — from 10 women running for Congress to 20 in 2018. That puts Texas at the forefront in a year when a surge of women as candidates has reordered the political landscape in state after state. During the first round of primary voting in March, 14 women — including three incumbents — won their primary battles outright. Tuesday, six additional women survived runoff contests to win party nominations.”  Iowa gubernatorial candidate faces sexual misconduct allegations - Des Moines Register: “Three Democratic candidates for governor suggested that state Sen. Nate Boulton drop out of the governor\'s race in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct made by three Iowa women and others are calling for the same. In addition, two Democratic lawmakers who had endorsed Boulton\'s campaign — state Reps. Bruce Hunter of Des Moines and Art Staed of Cedar Rapids — announced they were withdrawing their support. Other political leaders Wednesday also expressed a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment or misconduct, but they didn\'t ask Boulton to resign his seat or withdraw from the June 5 Iowa primary election for governor.” \xa0 Ohioans file suit to redistrict map before 2020 - Cleveland.com: “A federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Cincinnati seeks to toss out Ohio\'s gerrymandered congressional district map on constitutional grounds and create more balanced districts in time for the 2020 election. If successful, the suit would move up the timetable by two years for congressional redistricting reform in Ohio. And it could jeopardize some of what otherwise would be safe incumbent seats during a presidential election year. Ohioans earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to establish rules aimed at eliminating political gerrymandering in time for the next scheduled map drawing, but those rules would not affect any election until 2022. The current Ohio congressional map, created under secrecy and full Republican control in 2011, has resulted in districts making little geographic sense, stretching more than 100 miles, and predictable results with 12 reliably Republican districts created by packing Democrats into four solidly blue districts.”  MCCONNELL SETS STAGE FOR 2019 SPENDING The Hill: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on Thursday that he intends to pass spending bills for fiscal 2019 in groups of ‘minibuses,’ marking a departure from the previous year\'s dysfunctional appropriations process. The Kentucky Republican also set a goal of passing the first two appropriations bills on the Senate floor in June. ‘It’s our hope that we’re not just marking these up in committee, but taking them to the floor and getting as close to a process that both sides will be comfortable with in the future,’ he said. Speaking at the Senate Appropriations Committee, McConnell said that the strategy had been agreed to in consultation with Minority Leader Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) the bipartisan leaders of the committee and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The announcement came moments before the committee voted unanimously to approve 302(b) allocations, which break down the agreed $1.244 trillion in discretionary spending for 2019 into 12 individual bills.”  Meanwhile some lawmakers face backlash for voting on spending bill - The Hill: “A conservative group backed by billionaire donors Charles and David Koch is preparing to launch a six-figure ad campaign targeting Republican and Democratic lawmakers who voted for the $1.3 trillion spending package in March. Americans for Prosperity will drop the radio, print, digital and direct mail ads in the lawmaker’s districts as they arrive home for Memorial Day weekend. … The Republicans who will be targeted by the ad campaign are Reps. Hal Rogers (Ky.), Lou Barletta (Penn.), Mike Bishop (Mich.), Mike Simpson (Idaho), John Carter (Texas), Robert Aderholt (Ala.), Mark Amodei (Nev.), Jeff Fortenberry (Neb.), Tom Rooney (Fla.), and Ken Calvert (Calif.). AFP will also go after Democratic Reps. Stephanie Murphy (Fla.), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), Pete Visclosky (Ind.), Henry Cuellar (Texas), Matt Cartwright (Penn.), Beto O’Rourke (Texas), and Tom O’Halleran (Ariz.).”\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY Trump awards Medal of Honor to Navy SEAL for controversial mission in Afghanistan - Fox News\nTrump signs bank rollback bill with bipartisan support - CNBC   Trump admin investigates if tariffs are needed on autos, auto parts - AP  Van Hollen ‘welcomes’ help from Clintons in 2018 elections - The Hill  Former boxer, Jack Johnson, pardoned by Trump - Fox News  Twitter to verify candidates in midterms to promote legitimate accounts - Politico  AUDIBLE: LAWLZ  “[Kim Jong Un] got global recognition and regard.

Grand Forks [ND] Herald: “Mike Kohler lined up with thousands of other runners … ready for his first half-marathon as part of the Sanford Fargo Marathon. … But a misstep, right from the start, put him on an even more difficult course. Nervous and tired from waking up earlier than usual, Kohler wasn\'t paying full attention. He thought the full and half marathons started at the same time, at 7 a.m. In reality, the half-marathon started 15 minutes later. Wearing headphones, Kohler wasn\'t listening closely to the starting announcements. … At mile eight, when the course looped around from the bike path, he … fully realized his mistake, knowing the half-marathon course did not go into Moorhead. … Kohler thought about stopping at 13.1 miles, knowing he\'d run as far as he\'d aimed to. … But hey, he was feeling pretty good, and convinced himself to continue. … And finish, he did, completing the 26.2 miles in 5:54:26.”  Chris Stirewalt\xa0is the politics editor for Fox News.\xa0Brianna McClelland\xa0contributed to this report.

And being the most populous state means that California’s politics get outsized significance.\n\nIt’s the political equivalent of the phenomenon that when a blizzard hits New York City and whether you’re sunning your buns in Scottsdale, Ariz. or dining al fresco in Florence, S.C., you are subjected to nonstop coverage of the “snowpocalyspe” or “snowapalooza.”\nMedia markets and metropolitan size matter a great deal in terms of coverage, but it’s too easy to overlook the stories that affect the 264 million people who live in neither the New York metro area nor California.\nSo we know you know that California has a very consequential primary coming up Tuesday. And we promise to be back with blowout coverage of the Golden State’s races. They matter so much for what they will say about the direction Democrats are likely to take this fall and in 2020, so we will not skimp.\n\n\n\nHowever…\nToday, let’s get up to speed on the other states voting Tuesday:\xa0Mississippi, Alabama, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota. Put together, that list includes four Senate races, four gubernatorial races and primary contests in nine of the most competitive House districts in the country.\nGolden State may be dominating Cleveland so far, but the heartland won’t be getting shut out on Tuesday.  MOUTHY SOUTHIE: S.D. GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY TURNS UGLY  [S.D.]\xa0Argus Leader: “The gloves are off in the final days of South Dakota\'s GOP primary contest.\xa0… It wasn\'t always a contentious campaign, but over the last several weeks, Attorney General\xa0Marty Jackley\xa0and U.S. Rep.\xa0Kristi Noem\xa0are tirelessly working to convince voters that they\'re the best choice to lead South Dakota for the next four years. … Both candidates started airing negative ads about their opponent and releasing daily releases about his or her shortcomings. And in separate interviews with the Argus Leader, Noem and Jackley\xa0laid out plans\xa0to highlight the nuances that they thought could set them apart in the eyes of voters. The candidates appeared\xa0nearly even\xa0in an Argus Leader-KELO TV poll published Tuesday, with Noem picking up 45 percent of support from Republican voters likely to cast ballots in the primary while Jackley picked up 44 percent.”\nNEW MEXICO FACES TURNING POINT ELECTION\xa0 Albuquerque Journal: “A critical election year in New Mexico – one that could establish the political pecking order for years – will begin taking shape Tuesday as voters choose the Democratic and Republican nominees for two open congressional seats, governor and other state offices.\xa0…\xa0Two members of Congress – Democrat\xa0Michelle Lujan Grisham\xa0and Republican\xa0Steve Pearce\xa0– are leaving safe seats to try for the Governor’s Office, where the Republican incumbent,\xa0Susana Martinez, cannot run because of term limits. And voters have a broad mix of political veterans and newcomers to choose from as they weigh the nominees to succeed Lujan Grisham and Pearce in the U.S. House. … In the governor’s race, meanwhile, Lujan Grisham faces intense competition just to win the nomination. Pearce is unopposed on the Republican side. Democratic gubernatorial candidates\xa0Jeff Apodaca, a former media executive, and state Sen.\xa0Joseph Cervantes, a lawyer, are campaigning aggressively in the final days…”\nRivals pounce on Dem frontrunner’s financial disclosure -\xa0Politico: “Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham\xa0earned more from her role as co-owner of the company that runs New Mexico’s high-risk insurance program than she stated on her congressional financial disclosure forms for 2013, according to a review of the report and newly released tax returns. In annual financial disclosures required for members of Congress, Lujan Grisham initially reported receiving between $50,001 and $100,000 in dividends in 2013 from the Delta Consulting Group, which she co-founded in 2008 with a political ally who went on to get elected to the New Mexico Legislature. But her\xa0tax returns show she earned nearly $138,000 in so-called ‘passive income’ from the company that year.”\nIOWA GUBERNATORIAL RACE GETS CRAZY EXPENSIVE Des Moines Register: “Iowans\xa0will head to the polls\xa0in Tuesday\'s primary in what will likely become the most expensive gubernatorial race in the state’s history. Candidates for governor raised\xa0roughly $17 million since the start of 2017 — an amount that outpaces what’s been amassed during entire election cycles in recent years. Of that, $12.4 million has already been spent blanketing the airwaves with television ads, hiring consultants and sending mailers. Those massive numbers\xa0include through the middle of May and will only grow in the final pre-primary tally. The high spending comes amid higher stakes. Iowa Democrats — facing a volatile primary season, a slew of recent election losses and two years of total Republican control in the Statehouse —\xa0say they can’t afford another four years under Republican Gov.\xa0Kim Reynolds. Reynolds supporters say the state should stay the course in November and re-elect the first female governor it has ever had.”\nCLUB FOR GROWTH MAKES A BIG BET IN MONTANA Politico: “Club for Growth President\xa0David McIntosh\xa0thinks Republicans are being far too bearish in their predictions for the Senate this cycle, and he says it will be a complete failure of party leadership if they lose the upper chamber. McIntosh hopes his conservative organization can help sway critical races for its favored candidates, from hard-fought Republican primaries to campaigns against Democratic incumbents in deep-red states. The group\'s most notable investment so far has been in Tuesday’s Montana Senate primary, where it has spent $1.7 million backing state Auditor\xa0Matt Rosendale, widely viewed as the Republican front-runner, and attacking his chief opponent, former Judge\xa0Russ Fagg. The Club started spending in early May, and those investments helped set the tone for the final weeks of the race to take on Democratic Sen.\xa0Jon Tester. Montana is just the earliest preview of the Club’s spending plans for this cycle.”\nNEW JERSY DEMS EYE LONG-SOUGHT PRIZE\xa0 The Trentonian: “A competitive primary between two Democratic rivals on Tuesday will fire up the base as the party seeks to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Rep.\xa0Chris Smith\xa0in November. Smith has represented New Jersey’s Fourth Congressional District since 1981, but his prospective challengers say he has lost touch with the constituents of Monmouth, Ocean and Mercer counties. Fellow Democratic candidatesJosh Welle\xa0and\xa0Jim Keady, however, have to first emerge victorious in Tuesday’s primary in order to challenge Smith in the general election. Only one Democrat can get the party’s nomination to compete in the main event, so Welle and Keady are therefore battling it out to determine which one will appear on the fall ballot.”\nIVEY GROWS STRONGER IN ALABAMA\xa0 AL.com: “Liz Davis\xa0may typify the average Alabama voter ahead of Tuesday\'s election: She\'s aware of the primary, isn\'t sure who all is running and is ‘too busy’ to keep up with the blitz of campaign advertisements promoting statewide and local races. But she has heard the name ‘Kay Ivey,’ and she thinks the current governor is doing a good enough job. ‘I like what that lady has been doing,’ said Davis, 57, of Mobile, during a recent lunch at Hickory Pit Too in Semmes. … Davis\' sentiments are shared among almost all Alabama political observers contacted by AL.com in recent days. To the expert, anything less than an outright Ivey win during Tuesday\'s Republican primary would be a shocker. Ivey is opposed by three candidates: Birmingham evangelist\xa0Scott Dawson, Huntsville Mayor\xa0Tommy Battle\xa0and Alabama State Senator\xa0Bill Hightower\xa0of Mobile. A runoff, if needed, is July 17.”\nMISSISSIPPI NICE?\xa0 Fox News: “Mississippi has no shortage of candidates seeking to win its two U.S. Senate elections and a broadly contested 3rd District House race this year, but with only a handful of exceptions, there has been a noticeable lack of fireworks. The relative tranquility in the races has surprised local observers, who say it\'s the happy product of strong incumbents, narrowly avoided primary challenges, and policy agreements on key issues. There have been some splashes of unexpected drama. Last month, actors Robert De Niro\xa0and\xa0Alec Baldwin\xa0helped host a pricey cocktail party in Manhattan for a Democrat campaigning in what is widely viewed as a futile effort to unseat Republican incumbent\xa0Roger Wicker\xa0in the Senate. The party, which had suggested campaign donations ranging from $1,000 to $5,400 per person, benefitted\xa0Howard Sherman, one of six Democrats facing off in the June 5 primary, his campaign confirmed to The Associated Press.”\nTHE RULEBOOK: WHAT HE SAID “Let us not attempt to reconcile contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative.” –\xa0Alexander Hamilton,\xa0Federalist No. 23\nTIME OUT:\xa0WILTING FLOWERS Smithsonian:\xa0“A new X-ray study confirms … [Vincent Van Gogh’s] paints are fading over time. … In the latest study, reports [The Guardian’s\xa0Daniel Boffrey], scientists created a detailed X-ray ‘chemical map’ of one of the sunflower paintings held in\xa0Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum, mapping the areas where Van Gogh used the UV-sensitive pigments and areas where he used less sensitive paint. …Van Gogh used the photo-sensitive pigments in about half the painting. Currently, the darkening of the paint and the wilting of the sunflowers is not visible to the naked eye. But researchers are not sure how long they will stay vibrant. The museum has already taken some steps to protect the artwork, like installing smart LEDs last year which allow them to control the light spectrum hitting the paintings and more finely control the brightness and hours of light paintings receive. Despite the effort, there is currently no known way to keep the chrome paints from changing color. And it’s not just the sunflowers at risk—Van Gogh used the light-sensitive paint in many of his other works.”  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.\nSCOREBOARD Trump job performance\xa0 Average approval:\xa040.8 percent\xa0 Average disapproval:\xa054.2 percent\xa0 Net Score:\xa0-13.4 points Change from one week ago:\xa0down 0.6 points\xa0 [Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; IBD: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]  Control of House Republican average:\xa041.8 percent Democratic average:\xa048.4 percent Advantage:\xa0Democrats plus 6.6 points Change from one week ago:\xa0no change\xa0 [Average includes: CNN: 47% Dems - 44% GOP; CBS News: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; Pew Research Center: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Monmouth University: 49% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP.]\n**and now, for this important commercial message** Consider yourself an Influencer?

The armistice, brokered by California Democratic Party Chairman\xa0Eric Bauman\xa0and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, altered the course of one of the stranger primaries of 2018, replete with party meddling and nasty attacks but few policy differences. Looming above it all is the possibility that two Republicans will advance to the general election to replace Republican Rep.\xa0Ed Royce\xa0in a district Hillary Clinton\xa0carried in 2016. The Orange County-based seat tops the nationwide list of Democratic targets, but it became the site of an early, multimillion-dollar rescue operation when it became clear the wide field of Democrats could split their vote enough to land a pair of Republicans atop the all-party primary on Tuesday.”\nRiggleman chosen to replace Rep. Tom Garrett -\xa0WaPo: “Republican activists chose\xa0Denver Riggleman\xa0at a meeting Saturday in central Virginia to replace Rep. Thomas Garrett\xa0(R) on the November ballot, following a frenzied five-day campaign. The craft distillery owner and former Air Force intelligence officer will face Democrat Leslie Cockburn, a journalist, author and first-time candidate trying to capitalize on opposition to President Trump in Charlottesville and other liberal enclaves in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. The district is among about 100 nationwide that Democrats are targeting in hopes of taking control of the House in the midterm elections. It is a reliably red seat, but the pressure was on activists to choose a candidate who can unite hard-line conservative, libertarian and moderate Republicans and overcome a blue wave if it materializes. … The nominee was decided after five hours and four rounds of secret balloting that came down to two candidates: Riggleman and\xa0Cynthia Dunbar, a national GOP committeewoman with far-right views.”  GOP doubles number of female candidates -\xa0The Hill: “House Republicans have doubled the number of female candidates they have recruited to run for congressional seats this year as they seek to hold their majority and counter accusations of a gender gap with Democrats. There are 103 Republican women, including incumbents, running for House seats this election — up from 48 in the previous election cycle, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. The recruitments could be crucial in a year where the majority is likely to be decided in suburban swing districts where college-educated women and independent voters form a crucial voting bloc. Democrats have been busy attracting candidates in those districts, too, as the #MeToo movement and furor surrounding President Trump’s policies energizes the left.”\nThe Erins tag team Minnesota gubernatorial race -\xa0Minneapolis Star Tribune: “Minnesota DFLers wrapped up their hard-fought endorsing convention Sunday by unexpectedly backing lieutenant governor candidate\xa0Erin Maye Quade, a rookie legislator whose fight against sexual harassment and sit-in for gun control vaulted her into the spotlight. Minnesota DFLers backed Maye Quade a day after state Rep.\xa0Erin Murphy\xa0won the gubernatorial endorsement over U.S. Rep.\xa0Tim Walz\xa0in seven rounds of voting. … This weekend’s Republican and DFL endorsement conventions have set the stage for showdowns this fall. In order for Murphy and Maye Quade to face off with GOP contenders in the November general election, they would first have to beat at least one fellow DFL ticket in the August primary. Walz, of Mankato, and his running mate state Rep.\xa0Peggy Flanagan, of St. Louis Park, plan to head to the primary even though they lost the party’s endorsement.”\nSCOUTING REPORT: BERNIE’S BACKING OF DUBIOUS WORTH WSJ: “There is no candidate in the country for whom Sen.\xa0Bernie Sanders\xa0has expended more political capital this year than\xa0Pete D’Alessandro. Mr. Sanders hosted a rally for Mr. D’Alessandro, a U.S. House candidate who ran the Vermont senator’s 2016 presidential campaign in Iowa. He twice emailed his supporters soliciting campaign funds for Mr. D’Alessandro and recorded his\xa0only TV ad of the year\xa0to urge support for him. Yet Mr. D’Alessandro, a longtime Iowa Democratic political operative, appears from public polling set to place third in\xa0Tuesday’s\xa0Democratic primary. The Sanders seal of approval, for Mr. D’Alessandro and a handful of other Democrats, isn’t turning out to be a winning one in this year’s congressional elections.”\nBiden to decide on run after midterms -\xa0NBC News: “The former vice president [Joe Biden] already has been one of the most active Democratic surrogates in 2017 and 2018, and his advisers are hard at work on plans for a busy campaign schedule this fall that could have him appearing at as many as a dozen events each week. At the same time, he and a trusted inner circle have quietly been engaging a wider network of political allies to sketch the outlines of what a Biden 2020 candidacy might look like should he decide to run, multiple sources who have participated in the discussions tell NBC News. Biden himself has only gone so far as to say he’s not ruled out what would be a third run for the White House. He’s also been adamant that while a decision won’t come until after the 2018 midterms, it shouldn’t linger much beyond year’s end — a timetable that would help to bring some order to what could be the largest Democratic presidential field in generations.”\nStarbucks boss steps down, hints at possible 2020 run -\xa0Fox Business: “Howard Schultz, the Starbucks executive who oversaw the Seattle coffeehouse chain’s global expansion, will step down as the company’s executive chairman of the board, the company confirmed on Monday. Schultz, 64, spent four decades working at Starbucks. …\xa0A prominent critic of President Donald Trump, Schultz has long been rumored to have political aspirations. Schultz said earlier this year that the Trump administration ‘is creating episodic chaos’ in the country. ‘I want to be truthful with you without creating more speculative headlines,’ Schultz told The New York Times on Monday. ‘For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country — the growing division at home and our standing in the world.’ ‘One of the things I want to do in my next chapter is to figure out if there is a role I can play in giving back,’ he added. ‘I’m not exactly sure what that means yet.’”  TRUMP ASSERTS ‘ABSOLUTE RIGHT’ TO PARDON HIMSELF Fox News:\xa0“President Trump sought to settle the widespread weekend chatter over whether he’d consider pardoning himself if charged in the Russia probe – tweeting Monday that he has the ‘absolute right’ to do so, but wouldn’t have to since he’s ‘done nothing wrong.’ ‘As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!’ the president tweeted. Moments later, the president decried the investigation as ‘UNCONSTITUTIONAL’ -- the latest swipe at Special Counsel\xa0Robert Mueller\xa0amid negotiations over a possible interview with the president. … Trump weighed in after legal team member Rudy Giuliani fielded numerous questions on the self-pardon scenario on the Sunday shows. ‘The president of the United States pardoning himself would just be unthinkable. And it would lead to probably an immediate impeachment,’ he said bluntly on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press.’”  Giuliani says Mueller needs to ‘man up’ -\xa0Fox News: “Special Counsel Robert Mueller is sensitive to pulling ‘another Comey’ as the Russia probe enters its final months, Trump attorney\xa0Rudy Giuliani\xa0said in an interview Sunday. Calling the investigation a ‘long nightmare with the American people,’ Giuliani also issued a challenge directly to Mueller\'s team, telling investigators to ‘man up’ rather than seek to subpoena President Trump. ‘They have to make a decision without it,’ Giuliani said on ABC\'s ‘This Week,’ noting that the Trump team has already made available several witnesses and turned over more than a million documents. ‘So, come on, man up and make your decision.’ Meanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told ‘Fox News Sunday’ that President Trump’s legal team will ‘take it to court’ if Mueller subpoenas him as part of the Russia probe.”\nGOP LOOKS BEYOND MCCARTHY FOR SPEAKER CHOICES\xa0\xa0 WSJ: “House Majority Leader\xa0Kevin McCarthy\xa0and Majority Whip\xa0Steve Scalise\xa0are the lawmakers to beat to replace the departing House Speaker\xa0Paul Ryan. But their status as the frontrunners to succeed Mr. Ryan, who plans to leave office in January, hasn’t quelled chatter on Capitol Hill of who else might become a contender. And a brewing fight over immigration could foment angst within the House GOP, leading to unpredictable outcomes. … Still, it’s not clear that conservatives would want to push Mr. Ryan out early—and none of the candidates to succeed him has enough support to force him to leave. Many House Republicans are consumed by their own re-election races, with relatively few weeks of legislating in Washington scheduled before the midterms. … Most of those being discussed as potential GOP leadership candidates already flex some power, including Rep.\xa0Mark Walker\xa0of North Carolina… Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman\xa0Greg Walden\xa0of Oregon; Homeland Security Committee Chairman\xa0Michael McCaul\xa0of Texas; and Rep.\xa0Tom Cole\xa0of Oklahoma…”  McCarthy still defending tariffs -\xa0Politico: “House Majority Leader\xa0Kevin McCarthy\xa0on Sunday defended the administration for leveraging tariffs on close allies as ‘standing up’ for free trade. ‘We are in the middle of a trade discussion. Nobody wants to be in a trade war. Nobody wins a trade war,’ the California Republican said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union.’ ‘But we are standing up for the process of where we\'re moving forward that we have fair trade. President Donald Trump last week announced tariffs on metal imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, prompting each to announce they are considering retaliatory tariffs. Other Republicans have attacked the tariffs, including Sen.\xa0Bob Corker\xa0(R-Tenn.)… McCarthy pointed to specifics in the trade imbalance, even with one of America’s closest allies.”\nSUPCO SIDES WITH BAKER WHO SHUNNED GAY WEDDING Fox News:\xa0“The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, in one of the most closely watched cases of the term.\xa0In a 7-2 decision, the justices set aside a Colorado court ruling against the baker -- while stopping short of deciding the broader issue of whether a business can refuse to serve gay and lesbian people. The opinion was penned by\xa0Justice\xa0Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing justice in tight cases. The narrow ruling here focused on what the court described as anti-religious bias on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when it ruled against baker\xa0Jack Phillips. ‘The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion,’ Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion.”\xa0\nDavid French: How Kennedy did it -\xa0National Review: “No, the Court did not issue the sweeping free-speech ruling that many advocates hoped for and others feared. Instead it issued a ruling that reminded state authorities that people of faith have the exact same rights — and are entitled to the exact same treatment — as people of different faith or no faith at all. … The Lord works in mysterious ways, and it is no small irony that the same justice who just struck a blow for the dignity of the faithful is also the man most responsible for creating the constitutional right to same-sex marriage. State bullies beware, when Justice Kennedy declared in\xa0Obergefell\xa0that the First Amendment still protects religious people as they seek to teach and uphold those “principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths,” he meant what he said. Tolerance, it appears, is not a one-way street.”\nBILL CLINTON IN BREAKDOWN LANE\xa0 NYT:\xa0“Former President\xa0Bill Clinton\xa0celebrated the #MeToo movement in an interview that aired on Monday, but said that it would have done little to change his response to the scandal that prompted his impeachment. ‘I don’t think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts,’ he said in the interview on NBC’s ‘Today’ show. When asked whether he would handle the response to his affair with\xa0Monica Lewinsky, then a White House intern, any differently, Mr. Clinton said, ‘If the facts were the same today, I wouldn’t.’ … In the run-up to this year’s midterm elections, Mr. Clinton has been virtually invisible on the campaign trail because of new scrutiny of his past treatment of women, including Ms. Lewinsky. For years, he had deflected allegations of sexual harassment and assault from several women, but several of his accusers have felt empowered recently as the #MeToo movement gained momentum.\xa0Juanita Broaddrick,\xa0Kathleen Willey\xa0and Paula Jones, three of the women who have accused Mr. Clinton of sexual harassment, said in November that they felt newly vindicated.”\xa0\nYglesias: Democrats struggle with re-evaluation of Clinton misdeeds\xa0-\xa0Vox:\xa0“Of course, Democrats aren’t going to travel back in time to force Bill Clinton to resign in the late 1990s. But it also now seems clear that Clinton won’t be able to avoid answering these questions in future public appearances, which may well make him less likely to want to make public appearances in the future. There is also a strong likelihood that Clinton, who has been a mainstay of Democratic National Conventions for decades, won’t be speaking in 2020 or deployed as a campaign surrogate this fall for the first time in a generation. Yet it’s also clear that another cohort of Democrats — especially those on the older, maler side — are uncomfortable with the direction Gillibrand is going. That’s in part a disagreement about political tactics, with some seeing it as foolish for Democrats to try to hold themselves to a high standard of conduct when Republicans hold Trump to no standard at all. But it’s probably better to think of it as primarily a disagreement about substance and the still-ambiguous legacy of #MeToo.”\nHOUSE GOP FACE PRESSURE TO MAKE IMMIGRATION DECISION\xa0 The Hill:\xa0“House Republicans are facing a make-or-break moment on immigration as they return to Washington this week. GOP members will huddle in the Capitol on Thursday for a two-hour conference meeting designed to reach a consensus on the hot-button issue. If none emerges, then more Republicans are expected to sign on to a discharge petition that would force a series of contentious immigration votes on the House floor as early as June 25. Before lawmakers left town for the Memorial Day recess, two more Republicans endorsed the petition — meaning just two more GOP signatures are needed to reach the magic number of 218 if all Democrats sign on. ‘We\'re adding votes every single day. We\'re engaged in conversations to figure out, is there another path? I don\'t believe there is,’ Rep.\xa0Will Hurd\xa0(Texas), one of the moderate Republicans leading the discharge petition effort, told CBS\'s ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday.”  Cruz, Alexander conducting poll for Senate agenda -\xa0Politico: “Republican senators aren’t sure what to do between now and the November elections. So they’re conducting a poll — of themselves. Sens.\xa0Ted Cruz\xa0of Texas and\xa0Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have been quietly circulating an unusual ‘survey’ of their colleagues in recent weeks asking about their level of support for dozens of legislative proposals, some of them highly controversial. The areas under consideration include taking another stab at repealing and scaling back Obamacare; trying for Round 2 of tax cuts; eliminating or reining in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; defunding Planned Parenthood and other anti-abortion rights measures; instituting work requirements for federal welfare programs; expanding gun rights; instituting budget reforms; and dozens more. Yet the Cruz-Alexander poll will likely show that Obamacare repeal still can’t get 50 GOP votes, according to Republican sources who’ve already taken the temperature of the caucus, and that any proposal to make the Trump tax cuts permanent couldn’t clear the 60-vote filibuster bar.”\nPLAY-BY-PLAY Maureen Dowd: ‘Obama — Just Too Good for Us’\xa0-\xa0NYT  Pruitt sent aide to various tasks, including getting an old Trump hotel mattress\xa0-\xa0WaPo  Melania to skip G7, North Korea summits\xa0-\xa0Fox News\nAUDIBLE:\xa0THERE’S A DIFFERENCE\xa0 “No. I have never talked to her, but I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry.” –\xa0Former President\xa0Bill Clinton,\xa0in an\xa0interview\xa0with the “TODAY show” on NBC News, when asked if he thinks he owes\xa0Monica Lewinsky\xa0an apology.\xa0  FROM THE BLEACHERS “Wait -- Chris is a Cardinals fan???

Who would\'ve thought? According to\xa0The Guardian, the unidentified shaman also commanded the weather at LV\'s Cruise shows in Rio and Kyoto. While menacing clouds threatened for the duration of the show, rain did indeed hold off—unlike Dior\'s outdoor\xa0Cruise 2019\xa0show in Chantilly, which fell victim to an unfortunate downpour.\xa0Vogue Runway\xa0also reported that the Brazilian-based shaman flies only private, and commands a six-figure fee for ensuring the weather remains precipitation-free.

Waters\' statement\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump announced plans to give conservative filmmaker Dinesh D\'Souza, who was convicted of making an illegal campaign contribution in 2014, a "full pardon" on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\'Souza, 57, pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud after donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, a Republican, during her Senate race in 2012.\xa0He was indicted two years later, in January 2014, for using a “straw donor,” a person who\xa0makes illegal contributions to a campaign in the names of others, to make the donation.\nAs a result,\xa0D\'Souza was sentenced to five years probation, eight months in a "community confinement center,"\xa0weekly counseling sessions and given a $30,000 fine.\n\nTRUMP TO GIVE \'FULL PARDON\' TO DINESH D\'SOUZA\n"He was treated very unfairly by our government!" Trump\xa0said in a tweet\xa0Wednesday, which was then retweeted by\xa0D\'Souza.\n\nWill be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\nAt the time,\xa0D\'Souza\'s attorney,\xa0Benjamin Brafman, told The Washington Post in a statement that D\'Souza did not have any "criminal intent"\xa0— it was simply an "act of misguided friendship."\n\n\n\n“He and the candidate have been friends since their college days," Brafman explained to the newspaper. "It is important to note that the indictment does not allege a corrupt relationship between Mr. D’Souza and the candidate.”\nHOW DO PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS WORK?\nD\'Souza will become the fifth person Trump has pardoned since taking office, following behind\xa0former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, former Vice President Dick Cheney\'s aide Scooter Libby and\xa0the late Jack Johnson,\xa0boxing\'s first black heavyweight champion.\nHere\'s what you need to know about the charges\xa0D\'Souza faced.\nWhat was he charged with?\nD’Souza was charged with one count of illegally donating to a Senate campaign and one count of causing false statements to be made to authorities in connection with the contributions.\n“D’Souza attempted to illegally contribute over $10,000 to a Senate campaign, wilfully undermining the integrity of the campaign finance process. Like many others before him, of all political stripes, he has had to answer for this crime – here with a felony conviction," then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement in September 2014.\nDINESH D\'SOUZA GOT A FELONY CONVICTION FOR ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN DONATIONS; WILL ROSIE O\'DONNELL GET THE SAME TREATMENT?\nIn 2012, the\xa0Federal Election Campaign Act\xa0limited campaign contributions to $5,000 from "any individual to any one candidate," the indictment stated.\nD’Souza gave Long $5,000 from himself and another $5,000 from his wife in March 2012. Months later, he asked others\xa0— an assistant and romantic interest\xa0— to donate to Long\'s campaign on behalf of themselves and their spouses, promising to later reimburst them $20,000 in cash, the\xa0U.S. Attorney\'s Office said in a statement online.\n"When confronted by Ms. Long, D’Souza initially misled the candidate before admitting what he had done," the statement adds.\nD\'Souza\'s actions caused the campaign committee to submit "materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements" to the\xa0Federal Election Commission regarding the sources of the campaign contributions.\nIn total, Long\'s campaign raised less than $1 million for her losing fight against now Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., The Washington Post reported.\nFox News\' Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Deep inside the report were other strong indicators that the nation\'s economy is on the upswing. Black and Hispanic unemployment, declining figures Trump regularly touts, plummeted to record lows. Average hourly pay rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier.\n\n"President Trump’s policies are having a tremendous positive impact on the lives of Americans of all classes and backgrounds."\n- Andy Puzder\n\nThe unemployment and underemployment rates both ticked down, and reflect the continued tightening in the labor market,"\xa0Sameer Samana, global quantitative and technical strategist with Wells Fargo Investment Institute told FOX Business.\nThe news comes even as Trump has announced new tariffs as high as 25 percent on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, triggering retaliation from U.S. allies and protests from\xa0American industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nPuzder praised Trump\'s economic policies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n"The United States has been taken advantage of for many decades on trade," Trump said in a statement. "Those days are over. Earlier today, this message was conveyed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada: The United State will agree to a fair deal, or there will be no deal at all."\nTrump supporters say the president\'s economic plan and hard-bargaining with other countries is paying dividends for U.S. workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nKudlow said Trump\'s tweet didn\'t \'give anything away.\'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They want a quota on uranium coming from outside the U.S., so domestic producers can provide 25 percent.\xa0 Also, they are asking for U.S. agencies that rely on uranium to "buy American" (U.S.-produced material).\xa0\nIf the government agrees, it would be "an excellent way for us to salvage the U.S. market, allow us to be thrown a lifeline and do it in a manner that was the least harmful to our utility customers," Klenda said.\n"Right now, the United States, in my opinion, is much too dependent on people who are not our friends for uranium," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\nHis state is the country\'s leading uranium producer, according to the Wyoming Mining Association.\xa0Referring to Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Barrasso said, "We’re importing uranium from those countries and we’re not producing it in the United States. We should be producing it here, mining it here and enriching it here.\xa0To me, that\'s an importance in terms of energy security as well as national security."\n\n\n\n\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso\'s state is the country\'s leading uranium producer, according to the Wyoming Mining Association. Referring to Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Barrasso said, "We’re importing uranium from those countries and we’re not producing it in the United States. We should be producing it here, mining it here and enriching it here. To me, that\'s an importance in terms of energy security as well as national security."\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\nBarrasso\'s state has plentiful uranium reserves.\nLate last year, President Trump issued a presidential order to break U.S. dependence on foreign minerals.\xa0\n"I think President Trump is focused on the fact there are critical minerals,” Barrasso said. “And for an America first economy and American national security, uranium to me is high on that list."\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Commerce Department\'s Bureau of Industry and Security said the bureau is reviewing the petition from Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels to “determine if it contains sufficient information to initiate an investigation.\xa0There is no deadline for completion of this initial review, but Commerce will look to conclude its review quickly."\xa0\xa0\nIf hostility erupts and there is a disruption of uranium supply from foreigners, "our U.S. utilities would virtually be in crisis overnight," Klenda said.\xa0"When you take a look at these countries as trading partners, often times, these have become adversarial relationships... How much are we going to trust those relationships?

John Roberts reports from the White House.\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has dispatched his infamous\xa0right-hand man on a rare mission to the U.S. amid a diplomatic flurry aimed at salvaging a stalled peace summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol, Pyongyang\'s longtime spy chief and a vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party, was spotted at Beijing Capital International Airport, where he boarded a flight to New York after first meeting with Chinese officials. As the Hermit Kingdom\'s black operations chief, Kim has had a bloody hand in some of the rogue nation\'s most notorious attacks on South Korea and even U.S. cyber targets.\nPresident Trump, who abruptly canceled the June 12 summit in Singapore last week after hostile rhetoric from North Korea, has since opened the door for putting the meeting back on track. In a Tuesday morning tweet, Trump confirmed\xa0Kim\'s pending visit.\n\n“We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!” Trump tweeted.\n\nWe have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nChoe Kang Il, a North Korean foreign ministry official involved with North America issues, was also spotted at the airport and could be accompanying the former spymaster, according to Yonhap.\nNORTH KOREA SPY CHIEF, ACCUSED IN DEADLY ATTACKS ON SOUTH KOREA, TO LEAD OLYMPIC DELEGATION AT CLOSING CEREMONY\n\n\n\nKim, who is believed to be 72, will meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this week in New York, the White House said. Their talks will largely focus on rescheduling the summit between the North Korean despot and Trump.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol met Mike Pompeo during the Secretary of State\'s visit to North Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nKim was thrust into the spotlight during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics\xa0in February, when he was sent to attend the closing ceremony. Kim was pictured sitting a row behind Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, during the ceremony, but the two did not interact.\nHe was also spotted by Kim Jong Un\'s side during the May summit between the North and the South.\nThe U.S.-bound official is believed to have plotted the attack on Cheonan, a South Korean warship, and shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010 that left 46 sailors dead. He’s also accused of planting landmines across the Demilitarized Zone, according to Yonhap News Agency. Two South Korean soldiers have been severely wounded by landmines, though North Korea vehemently denied any involvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol sat a row behind Ivanka Trump during the closing ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nDuring Kim’s time in the intelligence agency, which is called the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea was suspected of carrying out the 2014 cyber-attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The department is tasked with carrying out cyber warfare and intelligence operations against other countries.\nTRUMP: US TEAM IN NORTH KOREA ARRANGING \'FOR THE SUMMIT BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND MYSELF\'\nThe North Korean official was also blacklisted by the U.S. and South Korea for supporting the regime’s nuclear and missile programs in 2010 and 2016, Reuters reported. His visit this week would indicate a waiver was granted to Kim to come to the U.S.\xa0\nKim’s visit to New York comes as officials from the U.S. and both Koreas head to Singapore for advance work on the possible meeting. Kim Jong Un’s de facto chief of staff, Kim Chang Son, flew to Singapore via Beijing late on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol is a former spy chief who has a controversial past when he was in that position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nAt the same time, a “pre-advance” U.S. team was traveling to Singapore to meet North Koreans, the White House said.\nU.S. government officials, including the White House deputy chief of staff for operations, Joe Hagin, left U.S. Yokota Air Base in Japan for Singapore on Monday, NHK said.\nUS HALTS NEW NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS AS TALKS FOR POTENTIAL TRUMP, KIM SUMMIT CONTINUE: REPORT\nIn Singapore, a team of U.S. officials, with a fleet of idling vehicles on standby, was at a hotel on the resort island of Sentosa but declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Yong Chol is headed to New York on Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nWhile Kim’s visit to the U.S. could prompt both sides to resume plans to meet in Singapore in June, history shows that things could still crumble at the last minute.\nFormer North Korean leader Kim Jong Il sent Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok to Washington in October 2000 for a goodwill mission. Jo, who was the highest-level North Korea official to visit the U.S. since the end of the Korean War, met with then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen.\nAlbright then headed to Pyongyang three weeks later, where Kim Jong Un’s father promised a medium-range ballistic missile the North fired over Japan two years earlier would be their “last missile.”\nHowever, the warming ties between North Korea and U.S. appeared to be short-lived.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\nKatherine Lam is a breaking and trending news digital producer for Fox News.

In his remarks, he highlighted his efforts to increase federal spending and took credit for securing pay increases for the military and more ships.\xa0\n\nHe told the graduates that a robust military made America safer as “you’re less likely to have to use it if you have it,” but said that if the U.S. must fight, then it should fight to win.\n“If a fight must come, there is no other alternative,” he said. Victory, winning, beautiful words but that\'s what it\'s all about.”\nHis remarks come a day after he cancelled a planned summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un amid aggressive language from that country. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Friday, however, hinted that the summit may be back on “if our diplomats can pull it off.”\n\n\n\nTRUMP WELCOMES \'PRODUCTIVE\' STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA, SAYS DEMS \'ROOTING AGAINST\' TALKS\xa0\nTrump has heightened tensions with Iran after he pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal -- a deal he had repeatedly blasted as a bad deal put together in part by the Obama administration\nIn his speech Friday, Trump also targeted “critics and cynics” within America who he said have sought to downplay the U.S.\n“A growing number use their platform to denigrate America\'s incredible heritage, challenge America’s sovereignty and weaken America’s pride,” he said.\nThat appeared to be a reference to some Democrats, who in a tweet earlier Friday Trump accused of “rooting against” the U.S. in its negotiations with North Korea, and siding with MS-13 gang members.\n\nDemocrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018\n\n\n“We are not going to apologize for America, we are going to stand up for America -- no more apologies,” he said in his address to graduates. “We are going to stand up for our citizens, stand up for our values and stand up for our men and women in uniform.”\nTrump ran his 2016 presidential campaign on the slogan “Make America Great Again” and in his remarks, suggested that he believed that his campaign slogan was being achieved, citing a “great reawakening of American spirit and American might.”\n“We have rediscovered our dignity, regained our stride and we are proud again,” he said.\xa0\nFox News’ Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\xa0\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

He added: "This is a trade dispute, if you will. It can be resolved, if people work together.”\n\nThe comments came as\xa0Trudeau took a more aggressive tone on "Meet the Press" in an interview that aired on Sunday, even as he compared Canada to the stoic, "even-tempered" moose.\n\n"This is a trade dispute, if you will. It can be resolved, if people work together.”\n- WH economic adviser Larry Kudlow\n\n"We\'re going to be polite, but we\'re not going to be pushed around," Trudeau said.\n\nTHIS MORNING: @JustinTrudeau says he took away advice from Obama that was "something that was deeply reassuring." Trudeau says on Canada, "we\'re going to be polite, but we\'re not going to be pushed around." #MTP pic.twitter.com/2nCeZqsPJH— Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) June 3, 2018\n\n\nCANADA HOPES RETALIATORY TRADE MEASURES WILL GET TRUMP TO BACK DOWN\n\n\n\nBut Trudeau, who on Thursday called the tariffs "totally unacceptable," signaled that he was open to the kind of conciliation that Kudlow suggested.\n"We\'re aware that we have to work collectively and collaboratively with the United States and that, quite frankly, has been my point with the president since the very beginning," Trudeau said.\nTrump had initially imposed the new tariffs in March -- saying a reliance on imported metals threatened national security -- but he had previously exempted Canada, Mexico and the European Union to buy time for negotiations.\nAfter Trump lifted those exemptions, Trudeau\xa0tweeted last week\xa0that the measure amounted to an "attack on our industry" and vowed to impose "dollar for dollar" retaliatory tariffs on the U.S.\n\nAmerican tariffs on Canadian aluminum & steel are unacceptable. As we have said, we will always stand up for our workers, and today we’re announcing retaliatory measures to this attack on our industry.— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) May 31, 2018\n\n\n"Our soldiers who had fought and died together on the beaches of World War II and the mountains of Afghanistan, and have stood shoulder to shoulder in some of the most difficult places in the world, that are always there for each other, somehow — this is insulting to them," Trudeau said on "Meet the Press."\nTRUMP: \'UNFAIR\' TRADE PRACTICES CAN NO LONGER BE TOLERATED\n"The idea that the Canadian steel that\'s in military, military vehicles in the United States, the Canadian aluminum that makes your, your fighter jets is somehow now a threat?" he continued. "The idea that we are somehow a national security threat to the United States is quite frankly insulting and unacceptable."\nBut in an interview on Fox Business Network\'s "Sunday Morning Futures," House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro said the tariffs are necessary "for national security reasons."\n"The national security issue is a flood of imports from 20 countries that are putting our aluminum and steel industries out of business---the national security interest ... is us defending ourselves against that flood of imports, so those industries can survive," Navarro said.\n"The president is going to defend this country," he added.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

No person should ever be penalized professionally for having a child! The #WTA should change this rule immediately,” she tweeted.\n\n\nThis is ridiculous. @SerenaWilliams is a formidable athlete (best ever!) and loving new mother. No person should ever be penalized professionally for having a child! The #WTA should change this rule immediately. #FrenchOpen.https://t.co/W5jQ5aEUXm— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) May 24, 2018\n\n\nWhile she was No. 1 when she left the tour to give birth, Williams is currently ranked No. 453. Without a top seeding, the 23-time Grand Slam champion risks facing highly ranked players in the early rounds -- meaning there’s a greater chance she could lose early on in the competition.\n"This year again, tournament officials will establish the list and ranking of the women\'s seeds based on the WTA ranking. Consequently, (the seeds) will reflect this week\'s world ranking," the French Tennis Federation said in a statement.\nWhile the WTA may add protected seeding for highly ranked players who return from maternity leave, the change would likely not take effect until next year.\n\n\n\nSome of Williams’ biggest rivals -- such as Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep -- have come out against the rule in defense of Williams, who gave birth to a baby girl in September.\n"Tennis is such a selfish sport but I think when there\'s a child in your life you lose a little bit of that, because there\'s something that\'s so much more important," said Sharapova, who has lost three Grand Slam finals to Williams. "So, yeah, I definitely think that would be a nice change."\nThe news comes after Williams told Vogue she suffered various health complications, including a pulmonary embolism, shortly after she gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia.\nThe French Open draw will be made on Thursday, with the tournament starting on Sunday.\nWilliams is a three-time French Open champion.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nMadeline Farber is a Reporter for Fox News.

When asked specifically whether that work continued after the 2016 election, Simpson responded: “I had no client after the election.”\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, however, challenged that answer in a new letter to committee colleague Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del. “As we now know, that was extremely misleading, if not an outright lie,” he wrote.\n\nHe said that, “Contrary to Mr. Simpson’s denial in the staff interview, according to the FBI and others, Fusion actually did continue Trump dossier work for a new client after the election.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter cites the House Intelligence Committee’s Republican-authored Russia report, which included a footnote detailing a March 2017 interview between the FBI and Daniel J. Jones, a former staffer for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. According to the footnote, Jones told agents he was leading a research organization called the Penn Quarter Group, which had “secured the services” of dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele; an associate; and Fusion GPS “to continue exposing Russian interference” after the election.\nThe committee report said that the Penn Quarter Group “was being funded by 7 to 10 wealthy donors located primarily in New York and California, who provided approximately $50 million.” Grassley noted that Jones said his group planned to “push the information he obtained from Fusion and Steele to policymakers on Capitol Hill, the press, and the FBI.”\n\n\n\nJones, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked four years for the FBI doing “international analysis” and as a staffer for Feinstein.\xa0Feinstein, who is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee, unilaterally released a transcript of Simpson’s testimony in January.\xa0\xa0\nGrassley\xa0said Simpson and Jones’ statements are subject to the federal statute 18 USC 1001, which bars lying to federal investigators. “So, despite the fact Mr. Simpson said he had no client after the election, he in fact did, and that client revealed himself to the FBI,” he wrote.\nGrassley, working with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., back in January sent a criminal referral on Steele to the Justice Department – claiming the ex-spy lied about his contact with the media regarding allegations against members of the Trump campaign. “As with the circumstances surrounding the Steele referral, we once again have two seemingly contradictory statements in contexts where material lies are criminal. I would welcome your views on what actions you are willing to take with regard to Mr. Simpson’s testimony,” Grassley wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrassley wrote the letter in response to Coons’ concerns about potential inconsistencies in Donald Trump Jr.’s committee interview. Grassley countered with his own concerns.\nSeparately, as reported by Fox News, after much legal wrangling on both sides of the Atlantic, Steele is expected to sit down for a videotaped deposition on June 18 in London for civil litigation filed against Buzzfeed, which published the unverified Steele memos in January 2017.\xa0The Steele-written memos were funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton through Washington, D.C.-based law firm Perkins Coie, which hired Fusion GPS for $1.8 million.\xa0The unverified information was also used by the FBI and pushed to various journalists during the 2016 campaign.\nEvan Fray-Witzer, the Boston-based lawyer for Russian technology executive Aleksej Gubarev, who is suing Buzzfeed for defamation of his companies, said in a statement: “We look forward to asking both Mr. Steele and Mr. Simpson about the work they performed after the election, which is when the memo concerning our clients was written.\xa0Obviously, if the work was performed for the Penn Quarter Group, it’s just more evidence that this was paid-for, private opposition research and not – as Buzzfeed tries to portray it – some sort of ‘government investigation.’”\nThere was no immediate response from Simpson’s attorney or Daniel Jones.\nMaking materially false or fraudulent statements to Congress can be pushishable by fines and imprisonment of up to eight years in prison.\xa0\n\nCatherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

But Mueller was, of course, hired by Trump’s Republican appointee, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nObviously, it’s not a plus for Republicans trying to keep control of the House and Senate to campaign against the backdrop of the investigation, which could produce more indictments before Election Day.\nBut the president’s increasingly harsh criticism, while shoring up his base, has the paradoxical effect of drawing more attention to the probe itself. Every tweet (or comment) generates endless retweets, blog posts, news stories and cable segments.\nIt’s hardly unprecedented, by the way, to go after an independent prosecutor. Bill Clinton and his allies tried to do the same thing to Ken Starr two decades ago.\n\n\n\nIn addition to bashing the investigation, Trump’s tweetstorm is aimed at some of his favorite targets from 2016 and beyond.\nTrump says he needs to focus on North Korea, trade and other issues, “not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.”\nAnd: “Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.”\nThe president has also channeled his favorite network, tweeting: “‘The President deserves some answers.’ @FoxNews in discussing ‘SPYGATE.’” Spygate, involving the FBI informant who infiltrated Trump’s campaign, is the branding he’s tried, with limited success, to get the media to adopt.\nAnd circling back to his favorite target:\n“The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON, I’m President!”\nThat’s the first time I’ve seen Trump, for all his attacks on the media, accuse them of a disinformation campaign, which sounds far more organized than news organizations could pull off. That doesn’t mean they haven’t been overwhelmingly negative.\nThe Washington Times said yesterday that “while much of America wasn’t looking, President Trump and Congress actually have been getting some work done together.”\nThe story cites new rules on VA reform and experimental drugs, as well as a partial rollback of the Dodd-Frank banking law. The latter is an important deregulation step that erodes the Democrats’ main response to the 2008 financial crisis.\nNeutering Dodd-Frank would be a big deal in a traditional administration. But it’s not surprising that such issues have been overshadowed by the on-again/off-again Korean summit, or by Trump’s Twitter assault against Mueller and the media.\nThe president could be laying the groundwork to blame GOP losses on a rigged system. But for now, he’s shining a white-hot spotlight on the very controversy he says is interfering with his job.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

Sponsors generally have some connection with the children, but not in all cases, Wagner said.\n\nThe agency goes through a series of background checks of the sponsor before transferring the child to ensure the child is safe from human traffickers and smugglers, Wagner said. \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegally, ORR is not “responsible for children after they are released from ORR care,” Wagner said.\nIn 2017, the agency transferred more than 40,000 immigrant children to ORR in 2017.\n\n\n\nBut between October and December, ORR reportedly could not account for 1,475 of the 7,635 children they reached out to, while 28 had run away, Wagner said.\nWagner said ORR is considering a fresh approach to address such errors but admitted that additional resources would be needed if the agency were to assume legal responsibility for the children. \xa0\nThe revelation of “unaccounted for” children has drawn increased scrutiny following the Department of Homeland Security’s defense of a policy that separates families at the border.\xa0 \xa0\nMeanwhile, lawmakers have set a pivotal closed-door meeting on immigration among House Republicans for June 7, days after returning from a weeklong recess. U.S. Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., said he and other moderates plan to see if that session can produce a consensus among Republicans regarding changes to immigration policies.\xa0\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBradford Betz is an editor for Fox News.

Lindsey Graham is pressing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on whether the Justice Department official should recuse himself from the Robert Mueller investigation due to his own connections to the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a letter obtained by Fox News, Graham, R-S.C., asked Rosenstein whether he considers himself a “potential witness” in the Mueller probe in connection with the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n“If so, should you recuse yourself from further interactions with and oversight of the Mueller investigation?” Graham asked.\n\n Sen. Graham\'s letter to Rosenstein by Fox News on Scribd\nGraham, in the May 31-dated letter, cited reports that Mueller’s investigation is looking at whether President Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey – and the fact that Trump relied on a Rosenstein-authored memo to justify the firing.\nRosenstein’s role was further detailed in a New York Times report earlier this week on a memo written by ousted FBI official Andrew McCabe. Fox News has confirmed that the memo described a meeting where Rosenstein claimed Trump had asked him to reference Russia in his recommendation to fire Comey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRosenstein declined, and instead focused on Comey\'s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe.\n\n\n\nTrump pushed back on the account Thursday.\xa0\n“Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!” Trump tweeted.\nA source with knowledge of the investigation told Fox News that Trump just wanted Rosenstein to mention that Comey told him he was not under investigation in the Russia case.\xa0\nTrump himself, though, has cited the Russia probe in explaining his decision to fire Comey. Any indications that the president was in fact motivated by the Russia investigation to act against Comey could fuel the obstruction of justice component of Mueller’s probe.\nMcCabe\'s memo reportedly has been turned over to Mueller.\xa0\nAsked for comment Friday on Graham\'s letter, a DOJ official said the letter has been received.\xa0\nThe new pressure on Rosenstein, meanwhile, comes as Trump continues to hammer Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his original decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe – which handed the reins to Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller after Comey’s firing. Trump earlier this week said he wishes he had picked another nominee for attorney general.\nFox News’ John Roberts and Jake Gibson contributed to this report. \n\nCatherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C. She covers intelligence, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security. Herridge joined FNC in 1996 as a London-based correspondent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

The host began by describing the policy recently announced by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\nNFL ADOPTS POLICY TO FINE TEAMS IF PLAYERS AND PERSONNEL DON\'T STAND FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM\n“When the anthem comes on, you stand," Cuomo said. "If you do not want to stand, stay in the locker room. If you come out on to the field, you kneel or you in other ways protest, you will be fined."\n\n\n\nHe then asked Pelosi: "Are you OK with this rule change by the NFL?”\nThe California Democrat responded: “I would be more OK with it if they consulted with the players. I don’t think the players agreed to this. This is the owners. And by the way, it’s the owners who would be fined,” she said, to audience applause.\n\n“I would be more OK with it if they consulted with the players. I don’t think the players agreed to this. This is the owners. And by the way, it’s the owners who would be fined.”\n- Nancy Pelosi, House minority leader\n\n“I love the national anthem. … I’m from Baltimore. That’s where it was written, during the War of 1812. So I’m very possessive of it. Some people say maybe we should change the national anthem. No,” she said, to audience laughter.\nShe finished by saying she not only loves the flag, but also the First Amendment.\nBut to many on social media and other outlets, the reponse seemed wishy-washy at best.\n“This is Democrats at their worst. Uhg. You either believe people have the right to voice their opinions or you don’t,” Hollywood producer Judd Apatow tweeted.\n\nThis is Democrats at their worst.  Uhg. You either believe people have the right to voice their opinions or you don’t.  Their quiet  gesture is meant to make people think about people getting murdered and abused.   To not support someone’s right to do that is unconscionable. https://t.co/cn3ORQ7WgE— Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) May 25, 2018\n\n\nIn a Washington Post essay, titled “Nancy Pelosi’s refusal to condemn NFL decision shows why Democrats struggle with black millennials,” Eugene Scott, who writes for the Fix, questions whether the Democratic Party has black voters’ "best interests in mind."\nScott writes that Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, told the Fix that rhetoric like Pelosi\'s explains why, in her view, most blacks in 2016 voted against President Donald Trump rather than for the Democratic Party.\n“Democrats need to develop a message that incorporates the critical economic\xa0security issues along with a message that acknowledges the impact of the rise in racism in the country on younger voters and have actual solutions on how they plan to\xa0deal with that,” she said. “But any message that fails to incorporate those two things will\xa0land on deaf ears.”\nMeanwhile, Jacob Weindling, writing for\xa0Paste Magazine, defends Pelosi’s response, arguing that the minority leader needs to be careful with her words, because they could be used against her.\n\nNancy Pelosi wavering on the @NFL national anthem protests was actually a very smart move https://t.co/f2jjoEGWBi pic.twitter.com/XxrpQpgEDm— Paste Magazine (@PasteMagazine) May 25, 2018\n\n\n“If Nancy Pelosi had said something like, ‘It was horrible of the NFL to violate their employees’ First Amendment rights, and we all need to understand this isn’t about protesting the military or the anthem,’ that reasonable clip would still appear in every GOP commercial across the country," Weindling writes.\nHe calls Pelosi\'s wavering on the issue “actually a very smart move.”\n"They would play the edited video with sinister overtones, and say something to the effect of ‘[Congressional candidate] is a Nancy Pelosi liberal who wants to go to Washington to help make it easier to protest the men and women in uniform of this great country.’”\nOverall, the Examiner\'s Adams writes, it seems the Democratic Party\'s leadership may simply have not yet decided “where to come down on the matter.”\n\nAmy Lieu is a news editor and reporter for Fox News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nOne photo of children in a cell was shared numerous times over the weekend amid outrage over Trump administration policies of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the southern border.\xa0\n\nTrump opponents who shared the photo included activists, journalists and former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau, who said: “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, that photo and other related images were published by The Arizona Republic in 2014, deep into Obama’s second term. Favreau later deleted the tweet, as did others who had used the pictures to blast the Trump administration.\xa0\n\nTake a look at these photos. #WhereAreOurChildren https://t.co/OZRG6YIXJB— Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) May 27, 2018\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told "Fox & Friends" that the backtrack suggests those critics were only interested in the photos as a partisan weapon. \n\n\n\n"They didn\'t really care about the story about the migrant children," she said.\nThe photos were circulated amid a debate over the Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy when it comes to arresting illegal immigrants. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution. Since children cannot be held in adult detention centers, they are often separated.\nThe Justice Department says the goal is to deter potential illegal immigrants from trying to cross the border, though critics say it is inhumane.\xa0\n“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”\nFORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL, LIBERAL ACTIVISTS SHARE 2014 PHOTOS FROM DETENTION FACILITY AS SWIPE AT TRUMP\xa0\nOn Tuesday, Trump also called for a “bipartisan bill” that would include funding for the wall at the southern border and “new Border Protection for good of country.”\nIt echoes a tweet Trump sent on Saturday where he called for Democrats to “end the horrible law that separated children from [their] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” and included demands for stricter immigration laws.\n\nPut pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!

John Roberts reports from the White House.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump fired back Tuesday amid the Philadelphia furor over his decision to disinvite the Eagles from a White House event, touting a patriotic ceremony being held instead and declaring: “No escaping to Locker Rooms!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump triggered a backlash from the City of Brotherly Love after he rescinded his invitation for the Super Bowl champions amid the controversy over national anthem protests.\xa0\nThe White House\xa0is instead hosting a "Celebration of America" event on Tuesday.\xa0\n\n“We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.\n\nWe will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\nThe White House decision to disinvite the whole team marked the end of speculation over whether the Eagles would visit the White House in some capacity. The team reportedly wanted to send a small group of players.\xa0\n“The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!” Trump tweeted late Monday.\xa0\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP SWAYED NFL OWNERS ON ANTHEM RULES, KAEPERNICK CASE DEPOSITIONS REVEAL\xa0\nBut Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney blasted Trump as “not a true patriot” and a “fragile egomaniac” over the move.\xa0\n“Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend,” Kenney said in a statement.\nLast month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the league would fine teams and league personnel who do not “stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.” Goodell said the league unanimously agreed to the vote, though San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York abstained. \nThe new overhaul does allow players to remain in the locker room for the anthem.\xa0\nTrump has praised the new policy, but his Eagles decision -- and swipe Tuesday at those who stay in the locker room -- reflects ongoing tension between his White House and players protesting police violence by sitting out the national anthem. \nTrump also used his Twitter account Tuesday to note past events the White House has held with other championship teams.\xa0\n“We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P.M.,” Trump tweeted, adding minutes later that “@NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House. It was a great day for a great sport!”\n\nWe have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others.

Tom Garrett turned his congressional staffers into his own “personal servants,” according to a new report, including making them pick up groceries, chauffeur his children and clean up after his dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne staffer told Politico\xa0\xa0that having to do Garrett\'s personal errands was “effed up.” The website granted anonymity to four former aides to paint a portrait of a “deeply dysfunctional office” where aides were asked to do duties outside their typical congressional jobs during work hours.\n“I can take hard work,” one former aide said. “What I can’t put up with is these just mundane tasks that [were] being asked to be completed by him and his wife that had nothing to do with the job.”\n\nA spokesman for Garrett declined to comment when Fox News asked about the claims. In a statement to Politico, spokesman Matt Missen called the allegations “unfounded.”\nAmong the tasks the aides claim Garrett, and his wife Flanna, asked them to do, according to the story: watch and clean up after their Jack Russell-Pomeranian mix, drive Flanna to the grocery store, and drive their children from their home in Scottsville, in his home district, to Washington - a three- hour trip.\nPolitico said if true, this could raise ethics issues for Garrett, as the House prohibits lawmakers from using staff for unofficial duties.\n\n\n\nIt comes amid uncertainty over Garrett’s future political plans. This week, though, he said he planned to run again for Congress.\n“There is no way in heck that I’m not going to be back here in 2019 as a member of the Congress representing the 5th District of Virginia,” he said. “Too darn much is at stake.”\n\xa0\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nTrump had\xa0 nixed the summit following threats from North Korea. But hours after the U.S. pulled out of the meeting, North Korea issued a statement suggesting the regime was open to talks.\n\n\nVery good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018\n\n\n“Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!” Trump tweeted on Friday morning.\xa0\nHe also told reporters that “we’re talking to them now,” adding, “It could even be the 12th.”\n“They very much want to do it, we want to do it, we’ll see what happens,” Trump said. “Everybody plays games.”\n\n\n\nA top North Korean official had issued a statement Thursday evening expressing the regime’s “willingness” to sit down for a summit with the U.S.\n“We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said, according to Yonhap News outlet, which cited the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA.)\nThe official also said that Trump’s move to call off the summit highlighted the tensions between the two countries, further emphasizing the need for a meeting. The official added that Kim had been preparing for the summit.\n“Despite all of this, the U.S.’ unilateral decision to scrap the talks causes us to reconsider whether all of the efforts and the path we have taken is really the right one or not,” the official said, according to Yonhap. “Our commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the U.S.”\nBut on Friday, with the door left open for potential U.S.-North Korea talks, Trump suggested it was the Democrats who were against “negotiations” with the rogue regime.\n\nDemocrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018\n\n\n“Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!” Trump tweeted Friday.\nFollowing Trump’s letter to Kim on Thursday suggesting to hold the meeting would have been “inappropriate,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the president, suggesting Kim had “won.”\nPelosi described the letter from Trump to Kim as a “Valentine.”\n“He’s the big winner and when he got this letter from the president saying ‘okay nevermind,’ he must be having a giggle fit, right now, in North Korea,” Pelosi said on Capitol Hill Thursday.\nAlso on Friday, the president tweeted about the reported FBI informant who had communicated with members of his campaign in 2016.\n\nThe Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018\n\n\n“The Democrats are now alluding to the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an ‘informant’ who is paid a fortune and who ‘sets up’ way earlier than the Russia Hoax?” Trump tweeted.\n\nCan anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018\n\n\nMoments later he added: “Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!”\nAfter a high-level Justice Department briefing held Thursday on the Russia case, Democratic lawmakers maintained there was no evidence to support claims of a spy in the Trump campaign.\xa0\nFox News\' Liz Zwirz contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova speaks out on \'Watters\' World.\'\n\n\n\n\nIt’s been\xa0more than a year\xa0since Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to oversee the investigation into whether Donald Trump’s presidential campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMueller was\xa0tasked with overseeing\xa0the Russia investigation, including any links between the Russian government and people associated with Trump’s campaign.\nTrump repeatedly has called the investigation a “witch hunt” and insisted there’s been “no collusion.” He’s also called the appointment of Mueller, which came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the case, “unconstitutional.”\n\n\nThe appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2018\n\n\nThe terms special counsel, special prosecutor and independent counsel are largely the same, though there are distinctions in how each is appointed.\xa0\nRead on for a timeline of other notable special counsel appointments in American history.\nPlame affair; 2003\n\n\n\nSpecial prosecutor\xa0Patrick Fitzgerald\xa0was appointed to investigate the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame’s identity. He was appointed by James Comey, then deputy attorney general, after Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the probe.\nBefore his appointment, Fitzgerald was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York who prosecuted terrorism cases in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,\xa0The Washington Post reported. He also was the first lawyer who built a criminal indictment against Usama bin Laden, according to the newspaper.\nSCOOTER LIBBY PARDONED IN CIA LEAK CASE\nIn more recent times, Fitzgerald\xa0reportedly was under consideration\xa0to become a special prosecutor tasked with investigating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server.\nWhitewater scandal; 1994\nRobert B. Fiske Jr.\xa0originally was appointed as special counsel by Attorney General Janet Reno, who served in the Clinton administration, to investigate misconduct pertaining to the Whitewater Development Corporation, a failed real estate venture headed by President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, along with James and Susan McDougal. The probe also included the death of deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr., which was ruled a suicide.\nAs special counsel, Fiske led the questioning of the Clintons,\xa0The New York Times reported\xa0in 1994. The newspaper described the event as an “extraordinary” move as it was the first time a sitting president provided a sworn deposition about his conduct.\nThat same year, Fiske was ousted, and former solicitor general\xa0Kenneth Starr\xa0was appointed special counsel by a panel of judges. They\xa0said they removed\xa0Fiske so that he\'d “be protected against perceptions of conflict.” Starr’s investigation ultimately led to the impeachment of Clinton as it encompassed the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\nBy 1999,\xa0Starr was replaced\xa0with veteran prosecutor\xa0Robert Ray.\nRay closed the investigation in 2000,\xa0officially clearing\xa0the Clintons of any wrongdoing in the failed Whitewater project.\nIran-contra affair; 1986\nAppointed by a panel of judges, independent counsel\xa0Lawrence Walsh\xa0was tasked with investigating alleged misdeeds by the Reagan administration in\xa0the sale of weapons\xa0to Iran to fund resources and weapons for U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.\nAfter seven years, Walsh cleared President Ronald Reagan and his administration of criminal wrongdoing in the sale of the weapons,\xa0The New York Times reported\xa0in 1994. However, Walsh said he found Reagan had “knowingly participated or at least acquiesced” in a cover-up of a scandal.\nEXPLAINED: SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER’S INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMP, RUSSIA\nIn all, Walsh charged 14 people with crimes, mostly related to trying to withhold or hide information from Congress. The paper reported that 11 people pleaded guilty or were convicted.\nWatergate scandal; 1973\nArchibald Cox\xa0was\xa0appointed special prosecutor\xa0to lead the Watergate investigation in 1973. Cox tried\xa0to force the White House to turn over then-President Richard Nixon\'s taped Oval Office conversations.\nIn what became known as the “Saturday Night Massacre,”\xa0Cox was dismissed\xa0from his post later that year. Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus already had resigned in protest after Nixon ordered them to fire Cox.\nNixon resigned in 1974 while facing impeachment.\nFederal government conspiracy allegations; 1952\nOfficially dubbed "special assistant attorney general,"\xa0Newbold Morris\xa0was appointed by then-Attorney General J. Howard McGrath as special prosecutor, tasked with “cleaning out corruption in the federal government,”\xa0it was reported at the time. Specifically, Morris investigated a reported conspiracy among Justice Department and Bureau of Internal Revenue officials who allegedly were fixing tax cases and accepting illegal payments.\nMorris\xa0sent special questionnaires\xa0to most federal administrative employees and requested McGrath’s personal financial records and notes,\xa0according to The Atlantic.\nMcGrath ultimately fired Morris before he resigned from his Cabinet position.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

In fact, the kingdom is a wreck because of their governance. Flowers are sprouting in the middle of the winter. Snow falls in the summertime. Everything is topsy turvy.\nIn the final lines of the play, Puck apologizes to the audience. Perhaps the play wasn’t up to standards.\n\n“Gentles, do not reprehend; if you pardon, we will mend,” Puck tells the audience.\nPuck promises better fare for the next performance. But Puck also gives himself and the players an out. Puck suggests that everything the audience witnessed may not even be real. It may have just been a dream.\nSuch is the case for House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOPers these days. A plan to approve a partisan, farm bill and food assistance measure imploded late last week over immigration.\n\n\n\nThat’s because disparate wings of the House Republican Conference are at odds with the GOP leaders over how to handle immigration and DACA policy.\nThe decision by key members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to oppose the farm bill helped dispatch that measure to defeat. Meantime, moderate Republicans are within striking distance of executing a rare, parliamentary end-run that will spur an automatic debate on four different immigration and DACA bills in June or July.\nThe contretemps spurred chatter among some Republicans that Ryan’s retirement was the issue. A few argued that maybe they’re better without the Wisconsin Republican and could push for a mid-Congress leadership election.\nRyan’s a lame duck, retiring in January. It’s unclear if the GOP will even retain the House. If the GOP anoints someone new, there’s clarity as to who’s in charge. Is it Ryan? Is it House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.? Is it House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., or someone else?\n“This is filtering around for a variety of reasons,” said one Republican source familiar with the talk.\nAnother senior House Republican indicated that the farm bill failure “lit the fuse” to switch leadership at the top in mid-stream. Democrats and Republicans pick their individual speaker candidates in late November. A vote for speaker is usually held on the floor every other January 3, the start of each new Congress.\nIn other words, everything is topsy turvy. Snow in summer. Flowers blooming in winter. The debate about the farm bill, really wasn’t about the farm bill. It was about immigration. A Shakespearean “play within a play.”\nMaybe the internal squabbles forced leaders to lose control of their kingdom. All they need now is for Ryan and others to steal a line from Puck and apologize to the audience, vowing to get it together before the next run.\nOr, maybe things aren’t that screwed up in the first place. Perhaps, a Puck implies, it’s all just an illusion. A dream.\nIn truth, is the pandemonium enveloping Ryan really that different from the tumult faced by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, before he retired in October, 2015?\nDuring his time clasping the speaker’s gavel, Boehner scrapped with rank-and-file Republicans over immigration. There’s a big battle over immigration now. Boehner presided over a failed farm bill in June, 2013. Ryan can now add a similar ignominy to his resume.\nLet’s be clear: There’s no one who can command the votes for the speakership right now besides Ryan. McCarthy even tamped down rumors he was trying to engineer a palace coup.\n“Completely untrue,” he said. “Paul has my total support.”\nFreedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., defended Ryan.\n“There are no barnacles on the speaker’s boat,” he said. “He will be speaker until November.”\nBut the concept of triggering a speaker’s vote over the summer actually carries consequences for Democrats. That’s why the maneuver is intriguing to some Republicans.\nRepublicans have appropriated House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as a foil since the historic 2010 midterm election, which flipped the House to the GOP and cost \xa0Pelosi her speakership. A unique byproduct of calling a vote for speaker now forces Democrats to vote on the record, for or against her.\nDemocrats must win seats on GOP turf this fall if they are to have a chance at winning control of the House. Pelosi isn’t popular in congressional districts in which moderate and conservative Democrats are vying for office. Republicans would naturally ensure that any speaker vote on the House floor in Washington trickles into those campaigns.\nSixty-three Democrats voted for Rep. Tim Ryan, R-Ohio, over Pelosi in their internal leadership contest last fall.\nBut Democrats dismissed the potential GOP gambit to get Democrats on the record again as “voting for Pelosi” just before the midterm election.\nMultiple Democrats noted that a mid-Congress speaker vote is a different animal than a vote for speaker at the beginning of a Congress. When Boehner left in October 2015, there was no real challenge to Pelosi when the entire House chose between her and Paul Ryan as his successor.\n“They’re not going to drive a wedge in our caucus,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said of theoretical GOP leadership calisthenics. “They ought to stop gotcha politics and ought to focus on substance.”\nBut a mid-Congress speaker vote could present another opportunity on the GOP side of the aisle. This is the “two bites at the apple” theory.\nA new speaker over the summer would face tests on immigration, the farm bill, federal spending and a border wall. There’s always a restlessness among House Republicans. So if Republicans tapped someone new over the summer and didn’t like their performance, they could possibly select someone else in January.\nHowever, this is postulatory. Perhaps a dream, as Puck suggests in the play. Republicans squelched any conjecture about GOP leadership for now.\nBut two weeks in late June could metamorphose abstraction into reality.\nHouse Republicans have etched in stone a June 22 re-vote on the failed farm bill. Remember that the bill didn’t fail because of agriculture policy.\nIt sswent up in flames over immigration. Key members of the Freedom Caucus yanked their support for the farm bill in an effort to force the House Republican brass to concoct a conservative agreement on immigration. That’s why House Republican leaders have worked so feverishly behind the scenes to bridge the gap between moderates and conservatives.\n“We are making progress. How it ends, I don’t know,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., a moderate, as he left a meeting with GOP leaders. “It’s important to have a fairly specific agreement by the end of the week.”\nAnd, it’s the end of the week, and so far, no deal.\nIn essence, the Freedom Caucus has taken a hostage: the farm bill. If there’s no compact on immigration before June 22, the roughly 35-member group \xa0will shoot the hostage and the farm bill will never return to the House floor this year.\nJune 25 is the next problem.\nA coalition of 213 moderate Republicans and most Democrats have signed what’s called a “discharge petition” to go against the wishes of House Republican leaders and force a debate on a series of immigration and DACA bills. A discharge petition is a rarely successful parliamentary gambit that can plonk bills onto the floor if the entreaty secures 218 signatures.\nThe House calendar is arranged in such a way that June 25 is the next available date to consider a discharge petition -- provided its advocates score the signatures by June 11. GOP leaders want to avoid a messy, divisive debate on immigration. There’s a chance that the House could approve one of the immigration/DACA bills with just the right mixture of Democrats and Republicans.\nYou want a Doomsday scenario for Ryan? Try a second failed farm bill, coupled with an embarrassing failure to maintain control of the House floor with the discharge petition and perhaps the passage of a controversial immigration plan -- favored mostly by Democrats. That turn of events would be apocalyptic. It could breathe life into the idea of early leadership battles as the kingdom devolves into chaos, ala the play in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”\nMaybe none of this internecine Republican conflict is real. It may just appear that way. Especially if Republicans find a path to quash the immigration rebellion on the discharge petition and pass the farm bill.\n“This conference has always had its ups and downs. The speaker will continue to move us forward as a team,” said Ryan’s spokeswoman AshLee Strong.\nIf that’s the case, all Republicans will have to do is apologize like Puck. They’ll try spruce things up for the next performance.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

He was the first to be sentenced in the probe.\xa0\n\nThe special counsel\xa0filed new tax evasion and bank fraud charges\xa0against Manafort and Gates in late February,\xa0potentially increasing the amount of prison time the pair could face if convicted at trial. The charges are similar to those filed in October.\nHere\'s a closer look at those who have faced charges throughout Mueller\'s probe.\nMichael Flynn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Flynn, who served as Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month before resigning, was\xa0charged and pleaded guilty\xa0in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI.\xa0\nFlynn reportedly lied about his talks with Russia\'s ambassador to Washington. In late 2016, while former President Barack Obama was still in office, the two allegedly spoke about the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia.\nThis raised concerns that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, misled Trump officials about his conversations with Russian officials.\nPaul Manafort\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Manafort turned himself in to authorities in October. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(The Associated Press)\n\n\n\nThe special counsel filed a 32-count indictment on Feb. 22 against former Trump campaign chairman\xa0Paul Manafort\xa0and aide Rick Gates, accusing the pair of tax evasion and bank fraud.\xa0\nThe new indictment accused Manafort and Gates of doctoring documents to inflate the income of their businesses and then using those fraudulent documents to obtain loans. It also accused Manafort of evading taxes from 2010 through 2014 and, in some of the years, concealing his foreign bank accounts.\nAnd on Feb. 23, a newly unsealed indictment accused Manafort of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.\nManafort\xa0turned himself in to federal authorities in the fall. The 69-year-old served as Trump’s campaign manager for a few months in 2016. Gates, Manafort\'s business associate, also turned himself in at the time.\xa0\nManafort was initially charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with foreign lobbying work, and he pleaded not guilty. The charges included: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, and multiple counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts,\xa0according to a\xa0special counsel\'s office spokesman.\nManafort sued to have the case against him dismissed and argued that\xa0Mueller had overstepped his bounds\xa0by charging him for conduct he says is unrelated to Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nRichard Gates\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Gates pleaded not guilty to all charges. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(The Associated Press)\n\n\n\nRick Gates\xa0was named alongside Manafort in the recent charges brought by the special counsel.\xa0He\'s accused of 11 counts related to filing false income tax returns and three counts of failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts.\nGates\xa0pleaded guilty\xa0on Feb. 23 to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges.\nIn wake of the guilty plea, Mueller\xa0moved to drop\xa0the 22 bank and tax fraud charges against him. The decision to drop the more expansive charges against Gates could suggest that the former Trump campaign official is cooperating and providing good information to Mueller\'s team.\nLike Manafort, Gates was initially indicted in October in connection with foreign lobbying work; he pleaded not guilty at the time. His charges were similar to Manafort’s – ranging from conspiracy against the U.S. to conspiracy to launder money.\nA superseding criminal complaint says Gates was charged with conspiracy against the United States between 2006 and 2017.\nGeorge Papadopoulos\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to the charges against him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Alexandria Sheriff\'s Office)\n\n\n\nA former foreign policy adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign,\xa0George Papadopoulos\xa0pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI regarding “the timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials,” according to\xa0court documents.\nHe also reportedly tried to set up meetings between Russian and Trump campaign officials on various occasions.\xa0\nAlex van der Zwaan\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney Alex van der Zwaan pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about his interactions with Gates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Yuri Gripas)\n\n\n\nMueller\'s team charged Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan for lying to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in prison\xa0and given a $20,000 fine on April 3.\nVan der Zwaan was released from prison on June 4 and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.\xa0\nAccording to\xa0charging documents, van der Zwaan was employed by a law firm hired by the Ukraine Ministry of Justice in 2012. He admitted to lying about his interactions with Gates.\nThe charge against van der Zwaan did not involve election meddling or the Trump campaign\'s operations. It stemmed from the special counsel\'s investigation into a covert Washington lobbying campaign Manafort and Gates are accused of directing on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian interests.\nThe law firm where he used to work says it fired him last year and will continue cooperating with authorities as needed.\nRichard Pinedo\nRichard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election,\xa0pleaded guilty\xa0to using stolen identities to set up the bank accounts in February.\nThe U.S. government said Pinedo did not know that he was dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts. The plea was announced on the same day that Mueller’s office charged 13 Russians and the indictment was the most direct allegation to date of illegal Russian meddling during the campaign.\nPinedo ran the online service Auction Essistance, buying and selling bank account numbers so customers could avoid security measures of digital payment companies,\xa0Newsweek reported. The\xa0Auction Essistance\xa0website says it is “currently undergoing scheduled maintenance.”\n13 Russian nationals\nA grand jury indicted\xa013 Russian nationals and three Russian companies\xa0in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. In the case, Mueller details a\xa0sophisticated plot to wage “information warfare” on the U.S.\nThe indictment is the first to be brought against Russian nationals in Mueller\'s investigation.\xa0\nHowever, the Justice Department said the indictment does not allege that the interference changed the outcome of the election.\n"There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity," said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein,\xa0who oversees the special counsel probe.\nFox News\' Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nMadeline Farber is a Reporter for Fox News.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit Beijing on Saturday for a round of talks.\n\nThe White House said it will target the tariffs on cutting-edge technologies, including those that China has said it wants to dominate as part of its "Made in China 2025" program. Under that program, China aims to take a leading role in developing technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and electric cars.\nThe list of imports that will be covered will be announced by June 15, the White House said, and the tariffs will be imposed "shortly thereafter." The list will be based on a previous compilation of 1,300 goods released in April that will be narrowed based on public comments the administration has received.\nAnalysts said the renewal of the tariff threat could disrupt Ross\'s planned talks in China this weekend. Ross\'s trip was originally intended to work out the details of a vague promise by China May 19 to increase its purchases of U.S. farm goods and natural gas.\n\n\n\n"If Beijing was under the impression that Trump\'s $50 billion of tariffs were actually on hold, they may find this confusing," Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said. "It could very well complicate Wilbur Ross\'s visit."\nTrump has bemoaned the massive U.S. trade deficit with China -- $337 billion last year -- as evidence that Beijing has been complicit in abusive trading practices.\nThe United States has also long complained that China forces U.S. companies to share technology with Chinese firms as part of joint ventures in order to gain access to its market.\nTrump has frequently focused on the trade deficit, urging China to boost its imports and lower the gap by $200 billion, while China has refused to agree to any dollar amounts.\nMany experts and U.S. companies, however, warn that China\'s efforts to protect its high-tech industries and capture U.S. technology represent the larger threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Billy Graham, warned Californians this week that their state is "in trouble" as it nears next week\'s primary elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham -- whose father was a globally known preacher who died Feb. 21 at age 99 -- is on a 10-stop tour in California, urging fellow evangelical Christians to get out and vote in hopes of chipping away at the liberal-majority Golden State\'s “blue wall.”\nDuring a speech Monday night in Fresno, in the state\'s Central Valley, the 65-year-old fourth-oldest of Billy Graham\'s five children underscored the importance of participating in the democratic process.\n\n\nFranklin Graham brought the midterm voter’s gospel to Fresno last night. When he asked the audience to pray out loud for CA politicians Jerry Brown, Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein, one man started speaking in tongues. #DecisionAmerica @KQEDnews pic.twitter.com/nzg0NWsLWo— Alexandra Hall (@chalexhall) May 29, 2018\n\n\n"Our country is in trouble," Graham told an audience at the Fresno Fairgrounds as part of his Decision America California Tour, according to the Fresno Bee. "Your state\'s in trouble – you know that. But there are things that we can do. You know God hears prayer."\nGraham invoked politics throughout his speech, reminding the crowd that it’s not too late to "turn this state around," while encouraging voters to lend their support to candidates who align with Christian values, the Bee reported.\nOf the stops on the California tour, three “are in or bordering critical House districts in the Central Valley," while “others hug the line between red and blue up the state,” the New York Times reported. The tour ends June 5, primary day.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to fellow evangelicals and top donors in a locker room at the Rose Bowl two weeks ago, Graham urged his supporters to stand up against California’s “Blue Wall,” according to the Times, adding that it’s time for church congregations to get out and vote.\nEven if Graham’s message resonates with evangelicals, who make up 20 percent of California’s population, according to the Pew Research Center, political strategists are still skeptical the state will turn red come November.\xa0\n\nBenjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

And at the end of 2017, Trump designated North Korea a state sponsor of terror again – a classification that came with additional sanctions.\xa0\nOn the heels of a planned, historic summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump’s tone softened, saying “great progress” has been made. But Trump ultimately cancelled that meeting, citing "open hostility" from North Korea.\n\nFrom agreeing to meet with Kim to dubbing him “Little Rocket Man,” here’s a look at what Trump has said about North Korea and its leader over time.\nBack together again\nAfter meeting with a North Korean official in the White House for more than an hour, Trump announced the June summit with North Korea is back on.\xa0\n\n\n\n“We\'ll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore," the president told reporters after the meeting.\nLet\'s call the whole thing off\nTrump announced on May 24 that he has decided to pull out of the June summit with North Korea.\xa0\n"We were informed that the meeting was requested by North Korea, but that to us is totally irrelevant," Trump said in a letter to Kim. "I was very much looking forward to being there with you. Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting."\xa0\n"You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used," Trump said.\xa0\n\nA letter from the President to Chairman Kim Jong Un: "It is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting." pic.twitter.com/3dDIp55xu1— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 24, 2018\n\n\n"I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately, it is only that dialogue that matters. Some day, I look very much forward to meeting you," he added. "In the meantime, I want to thank you for the release of the hostages who are now home with their families. That was a beautiful gesture and was very much appreciated."\nDeal or no deal?\nAfter speaking with the South Korean president amid threats from the rogue regime to cancel talks, Trump suggested the historic summit between him and Kim might not happen after all.\n“If it doesn’t happen, maybe it will happen later. You never know about deals. I’ve made a lot of deals,” Trump said on May 22. “You never really know. It may not work out for June 12.”\nTrump said he wants the Korean peninsula to be denuclearized in an “all in one” manner.\n“I can guarantee Kim’s safety. He will be safe. He will be happy,” Trump said. “His country will be rich.”\nTrump also said he’s noticed a change in Kim’s attitude recently.\n“I can’t say that I’m happy about it,” he added.\nSave the date\nTrump officially announced that he would meet with Kim in Singapore on June 12.\n“We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!” Trump said in a tweet.\n\nThe highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2018\n\n\nThe announcement came hours after Trump and the first lady welcomed the three Americans freed from detention in North Korea at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early on May 10.\nAfter Trump met with the three men, he publicly thanked Kim for releasing the prisoners.\n“We’re starting off on a new footing,” Trump said.\n‘Positive gesture of goodwill’\nIn announcing that a date and place has been set for his much-anticipated meeting with Kim, Trump also confirmed\xa0three American prisoners have been released.\nThe three Americans – Kim Dong Chul, Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song – are returning to the U.S. with newly-confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trump said in a tweet. The president confirmed the three men are also in “good health.”\n\nI am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date & Place set.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 9, 2018\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORIC SUMMIT BETWEEN TRUMP, KIM JONG UN\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump “appreciates Kim Jong Un’s action to release these American citizens, and views this as a positive gesture of goodwill.”\nAnother American detainee, Otto Warmbier, died in June 2017 after he was released back to the U.S. with severe brain damage.\n‘Good relationship formed’\nTrump has confirmed that\xa0CIA Director Mike Pompeo – his pick to lead the State Department – secretly met with Kim in April and a “good relationship was formed.” He said the meeting “went very smoothly.”\nThe president also disclosed that the U.S. and North Korea have held direct talks at “extremely high levels” in preparation for the summit.\nKim ‘will do what is right’\nAfter\xa0Kim’s first reported visit to China, Trump said “there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity.”\n“For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility,” Trump said in a March tweet, adding that he is looking forward to his upcoming meeting with the North Korean leader.\n\nFor years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2018\n\n\nHe also gave North Korea the benefit of the doubt earlier that month, saying he believes the country will abide\xa0by its pledge to suspend missile tests.\n\nNorth Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 10, 2018\n\n\nWhen Trump delivered a speech in Pennsylvania, the crowd booed the mention of Kim, but the president stopped them.\n“No, it\'s very positive ... no, after the meeting you may do that, but now we have to be very nice because let\'s see what happens, let\'s see what happens,” Trump said.\nInvitation accepted\nTrump\xa0accepted an invitation\xa0from\xa0Kim to meet, the White House said. While a time and place has yet to be determined, the two leaders are expected to meet by June.\nThe invitation to convene was extended by Kim.\n“Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached,” Trump said on social media. “Meeting being planned!”\n\nKim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2018\n\n\n“The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined,” he later\xa0said.\xa0\n\nThe deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World. Time and place to be determined.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 10, 2018\n\n\n‘Possible progress’\nAs North Korea is reportedly willing to negotiate its nuclear weapons, Trump cautiously acknowledged “possible progress.”\n“For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned,” Trump said on Twitter. “The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!”\n\nPossible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2018\n\n\nAt a later White House news conference, Trump said he believed North Korea, which has a long history of deception and threats to target U.S. cities with nuclear missiles, is “sincere.”\n“We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,” Trump said. Of the possibility for peacefully resolving the nations’ deep differences, he said: “It’d be a great thing for the world, would be great for North Korea, it would be a great thing for the peninsula.”\n“But we’ll see what happens,” Trump said.\nSpirit of the Olympics\nAt the conclusion of the 2018 Winter Olympics, North Korea sent the U.S. a message through South Korea, saying it has “ample intentions” of holding talks with America.\nDuring a meeting with the nation’s governors at the White House in February, Trump said those talks will only occur “under the right conditions.”\nThe administration’s position has been that North Korea must get rid of its nuclear and missile programs first before any talks can take place.\nRelationship status: It’s complicated\nIn an interview with the\xa0Wall Street Journal, Trump reportedly said he “probably” has a “very good relationship” with North Korea.\nTrump also suggested that he is open to diplomacy with the country he’s spent years criticizing, the newspaper reported.\n“I have relationships with people. I think you people are surprised,” Trump said.\nThe Wall Street Journal released the\xa0audio and transcript\xa0of the interview after Trump denied making the comments.\n\nWe have reviewed the audio from our interview with President Trump, as well as the transcript provided by an external service, and stand by what we reported. Here is audio of the portion the White House disputes. https://t.co/eWcmiHrXJg pic.twitter.com/bx9fGFWaPw— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) January 14, 2018\n\n\n\'Success for the world\'\nTrump told South Korea that he would be open to talks with its northern neighbor “under the right circumstances,” the White House said.\nTrump also took credit for the talks between North and South Korea ahead of next month’s Winter Olympics. At a January Cabinet meeting, Trump said it was his administration’s pressure on North Korea that caused the rogue nation to negotiate with the South.\n"Without our attitude that would have never happened," Trump said of the inter-Korean dialogue. "Who knows where it leads. Hopefully it will lead to success for the world — not just for our country but for the world, and we\'ll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens."\nWhose button is bigger?\nAfter Kim warned Trump about North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, Trump hit back on social media, arguing that his “Nuclear Button” is “bigger [and] more powerful.”\n“North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \'Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times,\'” the president tweeted. “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”\n\nNorth Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018\n\n\nKim previously warned the U.S. “should know that the button for nuclear war is on my table.”\n“The entire area of the U.S. mainland is within our nuclear strike range,” he said. “The United States can never start a war against me and our country.”\nGood news or bad news?\nTrump insinuated at the start of the new year that sanctions and additional “pressures” are having a “big impact on North Korea.”\n“Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea,” Trump said. Kim “now wants to talk to South Korea for the first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not – we will see!”\n\nSanctions and “other” pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018\n\n\nIn his tweet, Trump was seemingly referring to the recent, dramatic escape of at least two North Korean soldiers across the heavily militarized border into the southern country He also alluded to Kim’s recent comments indicating he would send a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be hosted in South Korea.\nTrump also took credit for the talks between North and South Korean leaders.\n“With all of the failed ‘experts’ weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North,” Trump said in a Jan. 4 tweet. “Fools, but talks are a good thing!”\n\nWith all of the failed “experts” weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North. Fools, but talks are a good thing!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2018\n\n\n\'Sick puppy\'\nWhile giving a speech on tax reform at a Missouri event in November, 2017, Trump digressed from the topic to call the North Korean leader a "sick puppy."\xa0\nHis comments drew hoots from the crowd.\xa0\nState sponsor of terror\nTrump re-designated North Korea a\xa0state sponsor of terror\xa0on Nov. 20, 2017, citing its support of “international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil.”\nDuring a Cabinet meeting, Trump announced the designation came along with new sanctions on the “murderous regime” as part of the administration’s “maximum pressure campaign” in dealing with North Korea. He said these sanctions will be “the highest level of sanctions” on the North.\nNorth Korea was on the list but was taken off by the Bush administration in 2008.\nWhy can\'t we be friends?\nIn a\xa0series of tweets while in Vietnam, Trump said he doesn\'t know why the North Korean dictator would "insult" him.\n“Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’”\xa0Trump said. “Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!”\n\nWhy would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017\n\n\nThe comment came after\xa0Kim referred to Trump\'s speech\xa0in South Korea as “reckless remarks by an old lunatic.”\n\'Don’t try us\'\nIn Asia, Trump issued a stern warning to North Korea, saying it would be a “fatal miscalculation” for the country to attack the U.S. or an ally.\n“This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past. Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” Trump said during an address at South Korea’s National Assembly.\nNorth Korea “has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness,” Trump said.\n\'Let’s make a deal\'\nWhile on his Asia trip, Trump implored North Korea to “come to the table” for talks on its nuclear weapons program. Trump’s request for North Korea to “make a deal” was in stark contrast to his previous hardline rhetoric when it comes to the rogue nation.\n"It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world," Trump said during a news conference alongside South Korean president Moon Jae-in in November 2017.\nTrump also said he’s seen “a lot of progress” in dealing with North Korea but still called the country a “worldwide threat.”\nIn a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo the day before, Trump repeated his assertion that the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was finished.\n“Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,” Trump said then.\xa0\n\nNoKo has interpreted America\'s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation. Do not underestimate us. AND DO NOT TRY US. pic.twitter.com/4llqLrNpK3— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017\n\n\n\'Rocket Man\' is on a \'suicide mission\'\nAfter dubbing him “Rocket Man” in a tweet, Trump eventually tried out the new nickname for Kim\xa0during his inaugural address to the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nI spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017\n\n\nDuring his speech, Trump vowed to “totally destroy North Korea” if the country so provokes him. He also said Kim was “on a suicide mission.”\nNo more talking\nAfter North Korea said it\xa0successfully launched a missile\xa0over Japan, a U.S. ally, and into the Pacific Ocean, Trump initially had a subdued response.\n"Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime\'s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world," Trump said in a written statement after North Korea’s missile soared almost 1,700 miles into the Pacific Ocean, triggering alert warnings in northern Japan and shudders throughout Northeast Asia. "All options are on the table."\nThe missile launch was said to be a “precursor” to North Korea’s containment of the U.S. territory of Guam by Kim, according to state-run media.\nBut in a tweet, the president suggested the U.S. is finished “talking” to North Korea.\n“The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer,”\xa0Trump tweeted.\xa0\n\nThe U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2017\n\n\nThe U.S. is \'locked and loaded\'\nTrump\xa0took to social media\xa0in August 2017 to proclaim that the U.S. military is “locked and loaded” in case “North Korea act[s] unwisely.”\n\nMilitary solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely.  Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2017\n\n\n\'Fire [and] fury\' isn\'t \'tough enough\'\nWith the threat of nuclear violence growing, Trump warned North Korea on Aug. 8, 2017 that he would unleash “fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”\nBut when tensions continued to rise and North Korea threatened to attack Guam, Trump said maybe that comment\xa0wasn’t "tough enough."\n"Let’s see what [Kim] does with Guam. He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before – what will happen in North Korea," Trump said.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson\xa0said\xa0Trump\xa0was "sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un can understand, because he doesn’t seem to understand diplomatic language."\nKim Jong Un is \'not getting away with it\'\nTrump said\xa0Kim has “disrespected our country greatly.”\n“He has said things that are horrific. And with me, he’s not getting away with it,” Trump said. “He got away with it for a long time, between him and his family. He’s not getting away with it. It’s a whole new ball game.”\n\'Strategic patience … is over\'\nAfter meeting with the South Korean president in Washington, D.C., in June 2017,\xa0Trump said that\xa0the “era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed.”\n“Frankly, that patience is over,” he said.\n\nThe era of strategic patience with the North Korea regime has failed. That patience is over. We are working closely with.... pic.twitter.com/nCZ51HnIdx— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017\n\n\nAs Trump made these comments, the U.S. was rocked with the death of\xa0Otto Warmbier, the 22-year-old American college student who suffered extensive brain damage while being held captive in North Korea for more than a year.\nThere are \'worse things\' than assassinating Kim Jong Un\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this undated photo provided by the North Korean government, leader Kim Jong Un celebrates what is said to be the first successful test launch of an intermediate rang Hwasong-12 missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Korean Central News Agency)\n\n\n\nIn an\xa0interview with CBS News\xa0during the presidential campaign, Trump said he could “get China to make [Kim Jong Un] disappear in one form or another very quickly.”\nWhen asked if he was talking about assassinating the North Korean dictator, Trump shrugged.\n“Well, you know, I’ve heard of worse things, frankly. I mean, this guy’s a bad dude – and don’t underestimate him,” Trump said. “Any young guy that can take over from his father with all those generals and everybody else that probably wants the position, this is not somebody to be underestimated.”\n\'What the hell is wrong with speaking?\'\nTrump\xa0told supporters\xa0at a campaign rally in Atlanta that should Kim want to come to the U.S., he would be “accept[ed].”\n“I wouldn’t go there, that I can tell you. If he came here, I’d accept him, but I wouldn’t give him a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people that rip us off when we give them these big state dinners,” Trump said in June 2016.\n“What the hell is wrong with speaking?” Trump said, referencing the criticism he received for being willing to talk with North Korea. “It’s called opening a dialogue.”\n\'Maniac\'\nDuring a GOP presidential debate in September 2015,\xa0Trump railed\xa0on the “maniac” in North Korea while answering a question about Planned Parenthood and women’s health issues.\n“Nobody ever mentions North Korea, where you have this maniac sitting there, and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea,” Trump said.\n“You have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, ‘I’m ready to use them,’ and we don’t even mention it,” he continued.\nChina needs to solve the problem\nEven before he was president, Trump urged China to step in and help alleviate problems with North Korea.\n“North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders,”\xa0Trump tweeted\xa0in March 2013.\nIn April 2013,\xa0Trump continued\xa0that line of thinking, adding that “North Korea can’t survive, or even eat, without the help of China.” He then accused China of “taunting” the U.S.\nAs president, Trump has said he is “very disappointed” in actions China has taken regarding North Korea, particularly “allowing oil to go into” the nation. He also said a Chinese envoy to North Korea “had no impact” on Kim.\n\nCaught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2017\n\n\n\nThe Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017\n\n\nAdditionally, Trump has said he’s spoken to China’s President Xi Jinping regarding the “provocative actions of North Korea” as well as the planned meeting between Trump and Kim.\n“President Xi told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative,” Trump said in March 2018. “China continues to be helpful!”\n\nChinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea. President XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. China continues to be helpful!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 10, 2018\n\n\n\'Wack job\'\nIn April 2013,\xa0Trump urged\xa0then-President Barack Obama to “be very careful” with the “28-year-old wack job in North Korea.”\n“At some point we may have to get very tough,” he tweeted.\n\nOur President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea. At some point we may have to get very tough-blatant threats— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 6, 2013\n\n\n\'Negotiate like crazy\'\nTrump warned that the U.S. needed to “do something to stop” North Korea in 1999\xa0during an interview with the late Tim Russert\xa0on “Meet the Press.”\n"Do you want to do it in five years when they have warheads all over the place, every one of them pointing to New York City, to Washington and every one of us, is that when you want to do it, or do you want to do something now?” Trump said. “You\'d better do it now. And if they think you\'re serious … they\'ll negotiate and it\'ll never come to that.”\nHe said then that if he ever became president, the first step he would take would be to “negotiate like crazy” to make sure that the country would “get the best deal possible.” Trump also predicted then that in “three or four years,” North Korea would have weapons aimed all over the world, including at the U.S.\xa0\nFox News\' Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

And I think what was lost were the two points that I made that are important to me,” Clinton said in Harlem,\xa0according to CNN.\n\n“The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble for me 20 years ago,” Clinton added. “First point is, I did. I meant it then, I meant it now. I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family and to the American people before a panel of ministers in the White House, which was widely reported. So I did that. I meant it then and I mean it today. I live with it all the time.”\nClinton was referencing a 1998 mea culpa he made before a meeting of ministers at the National Prayer Breakfast in which he mentioned Lewinsky and her family along with “my family, my friends, my staff, my cabinet.”\nIn his “Today,” interview Monday, the 71-year-old said “I apologized to everybody in the world . . .

Jeff Merkley\'s suggestion that he was being systematically barred from immigrant detention centers, saying federal officials took extra steps to grant him access to one on Sunday.\nIn footage uploaded to Facebook late Sunday and seen by more than a million viewers, Merkley, D-Ore., approached the Office of Refugee Resettlement facility in Brownsville, Texas, after remarking that the government\'s treatment of children illegally entering the U.S. was "unacceptable."\n\nMerkley then tried to follow somebody into the building, before being told that he was on "private property" and should "please go away." The facility, run by a contractor, is in a former Walmart with blacked-out windows.\n\n\n\nWhile he waited outside, Merkley called a number linked to the detention center and demanded an in-person tour of the facility. He then announced to the camera, "Well, she just hung up on me." Eventually, the police arrived and started taking Merkley\'s information, before turning him away.\xa0\n"And the attorney general\'s team, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, they don\'t want anyone to know about what\'s going on behind these doors," Merkley told a police officer.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration, which has called it "horrible" that illegal immigrant children are separated from their parents when their parents enter criminal proceedings, has been criticized in recent weeks for increasing the proseuctions of illegal immigrants under a "zero-tolerance" policy that critics say leads to those separations.\nBut the White House made it clear that it viewed Merkley\'s effort as a hollow stunt.\nHHS OFFICIAL CALLS REPORT AGENCY LOST TRACK OF 1,500 CHILDREN \'MISLEADING\'\n"Senator Merkley is irresponsibly spreading blatant lies about routine immigration enforcement while smearing hardworking, dedicated law enforcement officials at ICE and CBP," deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News.\n\nI was barred entry. Asked repeatedly to speak to a supervisor—he finally came out and said he can’t tell us anything. Police were called on us.Children should never be ripped from their families & held in secretive detention centers. RT if you agree this is WRONG. pic.twitter.com/GVCuXNjR8d— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\n"He voted against closing the \'catch-and-release\' loopholes used by child smugglers, and his reckless open borders policies are responsible for the permanent separation of thousands of American families who have been forced to bury their loved ones," Gidley added. "No one is taking a public safety lecture from Sen. Merkley, whose own policies endanger children, empower human smugglers and drug cartels, and allow violent criminal aliens to flood into American communities."\nAlso on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security said it had accomodated Merkley\'s request to visit a secure immigration facility where children were being held, despite logistical challenges.\n"We appreciate the Senator’s interest in the subject, and are happy to provide him with an understanding of the immigration process: DHS follows the laws passed by Congress and processes alien children safely and humanely," DHS press secretary Tyler Houlton said in a statement to Fox News. "Contrary to any misinformation campaign, the safety of children is paramount for DHS.\n"At 2pm on a Friday, the Senator asked to visit a secure DHS facility over the weekend where children are present and we worked with him to provide him access," Houlton added. "This presented obvious and serious privacy concerns – not to mention disrupting operations. He was able to visit the facility on Sunday."\n\n"Senator Merkley is irresponsibly spreading blatant lies about routine immigration enforcement."\n- Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley \n\nMerkley previously claimed he saw caged children at another Texas detention facility.\nLast week,\xa0President Trump slammed Democrats who shared pictures of child migrants sleeping in cages to knock his immigration policies, only to backtrack after realizing the photos were taken during the Obama administration.\n"When I was at the center at McAllen Border Station, this is the processing center, earlier and I was admitted there and I did see the people, hundreds of children locked up in cages there at that facility," Merkley said in an interview with CNN. "They have big cages made out of fencing and then wire and nets stretched across the top of them so people can\'t climb out of them."\xa0\nWHOOPS: DEMS BACKTRACK AFTER\xa0 REALIZING VIRAL PHOTO OF CAGED KIDS IS FROM OBAMA ADMIN\nAt various points in the video uploaded to Facebook, Merkley made broad political points, alternately to the camera and to responding law enforcement officers.\n"Every American citizen has a stake in how these children are being treated and how this policy is being enacted," Merkley said in the Facebook video.\nIn a statement to Fox News,\xa0Merkley Communications Director Ray Zaccaro shot back at the White House and insisted on more transparency.\n“The\xa0White House\xa0is\xa0smearing\xa0Senator Merkley because they can’t defend their indefensible policy of snatching children from their parents," Zaccaro said. "Senator Merkley and his staff saw children in cages yesterday at the DHS processing center.\xa0We still have no idea what’s happening in the detention center where reportedly up to a thousand children are being held, since they refused the Senator’s request to go inside."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

And they are well aware that how states draw maps, based on the 2020 Census, could determine which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives and most state legislatures for years to come.\nEnter Holder and the group he chairs, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.\n\nThe organization is focused on overhauling those maps and fighting the “gerrymandering” that in some cases favors Republicans.\xa0The goal is to back state Democratic candidates who could have a say in drawing new districts after 2020. Holder, while also mulling a 2020 presidential run, is now targeting a\xa0dozen states—four of which are expected to gain at least one congressional seat after the Census. Former President Barack Obama, Holder’s old boss, has also lent his name to the effort.\n“In many states, governors and state senators elected to four-year terms will still be in office when new maps are drawn in 2021,” NDRC spokesman\xa0Patrick Rodenbush told Fox News. “That makes this a crucial year for redistricting.”\n\n\'In many states, governors and state senators elected to four-year terms will still be in office when new maps are drawn in 2021. That makes this a crucial year for redistricting.\'\n- NDRC spokesman Patrick Rodenbush \n\nThe organization, which The Wall Street Journal\xa0reported\xa0will spend $35 million on campaigns and litigation in 2018, claims “the system is rigged” in favor of Republicans because of gerrymandering.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is spending another $35 million for 2018; and Forward Majority, a Democratic super PAC, plans to spend more than $20 million on state legislative ads, the Journal reported.\nDespite a\xa0controversial tenure\xa0as attorney general, Holder is considering a presidential run in 2020 and visited the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire last week. While there, he kept the door open to a White House run, but tried to focus his remarks on his redistricting mission. “Politicians are picking their voters as opposed to citizens choosing who their representatives are going to be,” he complained.\xa0\nHOLDER TALKS 2020 SHOWDOWN WITH TRUMP\nSo where is Holder waging this battle?\nThe group is particularly active in Texas, which is\xa0expected to gain up to three U.S. House seats after the 2020 Census,\xa0targeting gubernatorial and state legislative races there.\nHolder’s group is also eyeing the always-crucial battleground of Florida, which it anticipates will gain two congressional seats after 2020; Colorado, which the group identifies as likely to gain one congressional seat after the Census; and Georgia, a state Democrats tried unsuccessfully to flip in the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolder last month cheered the Democratic gubernatorial primary victory in Georgia by Stacey Abrams, issuing a statement saying, “If elected, she has pledged to continue her fight for voting rights, including by vetoing gerrymandered districts when new lines are drawn in 2021.”\nHolder’s organization is also interested in gubernatorial and legislative races in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Two other states on the target list—North Carolina and Virginia—are only holding legislative races in 2018.\nOhio became the latest state to approve a bipartisan commission to decide congressional and legislative districts after a referendum on which Holder’s group spent $50,000.\n“The redistricting reform passed … in Ohio makes it much harder for politicians to rig elections through gerrymandering and gives me hope that we can restore fairness to our elections in states around the country,” Holder said in a statement last month. “This fall, Ohioans have the opportunity to support strong Democratic candidates who will have a seat at the table when new state and congressional lines are drawn in 2021.”\nIn another targeted state, Holder’s group\xa0sued\xa0Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker after he declined to call a special election to fill two open legislative seats.\nThe stakes for these seemingly granular battles are huge.\nDuring the Obama years, the GOP flipped 958 state legislative seats. Before 2010, Democrats controlled 60 of the 99 legislative chambers across the country. Now, it’s just 32.\nRepublicans flipped many legislatures in states with maps approved by Democratic lawmakers, noted Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee. So, he argues, gerrymandering is no excuse for Democratic losses.\n“We understand that voters are different from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon, while the progressive mindset is one of top-down policies,” Walter told Fox News.\n“Holder wants favorable Democratic districts while arguing a false holier-than-thou principle of do as I say, not as I do,” Walter added. “It’s shallow and crass and has nothing to do with good government at all.”\nRodenbush, the NDRC spokesman,\xa0referenced\xa0a Holder speech in March to affirm the group isn’t just seeking Democratic gerrymandering to replace GOP gerrymandering. During that Georgetown University address, the former attorney general said\xa0Republicans “aren’t simply going to give up power,” adding, “You give me a fair fight; I’ll have a Democratic Congress.”\nState legislatures in 42 states decide on congressional districts. Of those, 37 also pick state legislative districts. The remaining states have some form of commission, which Holder desires.\nGerrymandering is a more democratic process than naming a bureaucratic commission to draw maps, argued J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department voting section lawyer and Holder critic.\n“Gerrymandering is a good thing because it means the people who won elections are supporting the will of the people in drawing district lines,” Adams, now president of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation that specializes in election law and voter fraud cases, told Fox News.\nThe term gerrymandering comes from former Massachusetts Gov.\xa0Eldridge Gerry, who in 1812 signed a redistricting bill that favored his Democratic-Republican party over the Federalist party in the state. Because one of the districts looked like a salamander, partisan maps became known as gerrymandering.\nFred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal.

So many Democratic contenders have jumped into key races – largely running on an anti-Trump platform – that the overload threatens to split the vote and boost Republicans.\xa0\nBut the state nevertheless offers Democrats a wealth of opportunities to swipe seats. California\'s House races, meanwhile, are just a fraction of the action taking place on Tuesday, the biggest primary day so far this cycle. With eight states voting, an array of contests will reveal how each party is trending as the midterms near:\xa0\n\nCALIFORNIA GOVERNOR\nCalifornia’s “jungle primary” is set up to advance the top-two finishers to the general election regardless of party. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a liberal Democrat, is the clear front-runner in the gubernatorial race, according to recent polls. But the fight for the second spot on the ballot is being fought among a handful of hopefuls – notably former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Republican businessman John Cox, who appears to be surging after an endorsement from President Trump.\nMONTANA SENATE\n\n\n\nRepublican candidates are lining up to challenge Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who represents a state President Trump easily won in 2016.\xa0Among the GOP challengers in Tuesday’s primary: state auditor Matt Rosendale, Judge Russ Fagg, state Sen. Albert Olszewski and combat veteran Troy Downing. Fox News’ Power Rankings rate the Montana race as one of eight Senate toss-ups this year.\nCALIFORNIA SENATE\nLongtime incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., remains the front-runner in the state’s Senate race despite her failure to secure the California Democratic Party’s endorsement in February.\xa0The fight for the second spot on the ballot is between the more liberal Democratic state Sen. Kevin de Leon and Republican James P. Bradley, among others.\nNEW MEXICO GOVERNOR\nDemocrats are hoping to turn New Mexico blue in this year’s gubernatorial race. Susana Martinez, the current GOP governor, is term-limited. For the Democrats, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, state Sen. Joseph Cervantes and entrepreneur Jeff Apodaca are contending for their party’s nomination. For Republicans, Rep. Steve Pearce is running unopposed.\nCLICK FOR MORE PRIMARY RACES TO WATCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the most consequential races Tuesday are the House battles playing out in California, with control of Congress at stake.\xa0\nDemocrats need to flip 23 GOP-held seats to wrest the House majority from Republicans this fall, and the party is targeting 10 districts in the Golden State alone.\n\n\nStates Voting June 5\n\n\n\nAlabama\nCalifornia\xa0\nIowa\xa0\nMississippi\xa0\nMontana\xa0\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico\xa0\nSouth Dakota\n\n\n\nThat’s why Tuesday is so important.\nAmong the targeted Republican seats is one held by Republican Rep. Mimi Walters.\nNo Democrat has ever represented Walters’ 45th District in Orange County, but four Democratic candidates are competing for a chance to challenge her in November.\nWalters dinged House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for the surge of would-be challengers.\xa0\nSENATE RACE RATINGS AND FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE\n“This is really her only chance to flip the House,” Walters said. “So she’s taking on members like myself who typically she wouldn’t in the past.”\nKia Hamadanchy, one of the hopefuls trying to capitalize on what he calls the “Obama coalition” of young voters and immigrants, argued that a “progressive message” is the path to victory.\nHamadanchy joins Democrats Katie Porter, Dave Min and Brian Forde on the ballot Tuesday, and hopes that highlighting Walters’ vote in favor of the GOP-engineered tax reform bill will resonate.\n\n\'It doesn’t look like there’s a blue wave. It’s turning into a bit of a blue trickle.\'\n- GOP congressional candidate Scott Baugh\n\n“One thing they tell you as a Republican in Orange County is never raise taxes, and one of the things she’s done is voted to raise taxes on all her constituents,” Hamadanchy said.\nWalters disputes any liability from her vote to reform the tax code. Republicans argue that the legislation largely resulted in tax cuts.\n“I think people in my district are very happy with the tax reform package,” Walters said.\nRepublican lawmakers in Orange County, meanwhile, are hoping that Democrats crowd themselves out in some of Tuesday’s races.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 48th district, for instance, which includes Newport Beach and Laguna Beach, Democrats face a potential scenario where two Republicans – and no Democrats – advance to November.\nThe seat is currently represented by GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, who’s faced criticism over Russia-friendly rhetoric. But if Democrats split the vote too many ways on Tuesday, Republicans could grab the first and second ballot spots under the “jungle primary” system.\n“We’ve got eight people on the ballot,” said Harley Rouda, a Democratic candidate hoping to challenge the longtime GOP incumbent. “The issue is the jungle primary in California, and what sounded like a great idea, just the top-two vote getters move forward, has turned into all sorts of gamesmanship.”\nRouda has the support of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is working to warn voters about the possibility that they might not have any Democratic options in November.\n“While the top-two problem certainly presents challenges for Democrats, it’s really important that folks get out and vote over the next couple of days,” said Andrew Godinich, west regional press secretary for the DCCC.\nScott Baugh, a former state lawmaker, is the Republican hoping to snag that second slot and challenge Rohrabacher in November.\n“If I come in second … the Republicans don’t have to spend any money to defend the seat, it’s already a Republican seat,” he noted.\nBaugh, who argues that Rohrabacher hasn’t been productive enough during several decades in Congress, believes that if Tuesday’s primary leaves Democrats without a candidate on the ballot, their national strategy will suffer.\n“It doesn’t look like there’s a blue wave,” Baugh said. “It’s turning into a bit of a blue trickle or a blue drought or something.”\nBut over in California’s 49th district, Democrats see another opportunity in the seat soon to be vacated by retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa.\n“Every week for 67 weeks, rain or shine after Trump’s inauguration, there were protesters that arrived outside Darrell Issa’s office, hundreds at a time,” said Democratic candidate Mike Levin. “And they represented every demographic, every age, all backgrounds in our community.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevin is banking on support from constituents frustrated by a lack of attention to environmental issues.\n“Our district has 52 miles of coastline from north to south, we care very deeply about clean air and clean water, clean beach, getting the nuclear waste off our coast.

So if two Republicans top the field, the Democrats would be shut out of the general election.\nThat GOP shutout is likely to happen in the 48th District, because two of the candidates are well-known former Orange County GOP Chairman Scott Baugh and incumbent U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, the Register reported.\n\n"The [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee] machine is bringing its classic unethical tricks from the swamp in Washington to the shores of Orange County."\n- John Gabbard, GOP candidate seeking a U.S. House seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Gabbard, a GOP congressional candidate, is a small business owner and Marine Corps veteran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Facebook)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the Democrats\' best hope of getting one of their own -- either businessman Harley Rouda or stem-cell biologist Hans Keirstead -- to finish in the top two may be to back Gabbard, and hope he siphons enough votes away from Baugh or Roherabacher to eliminate one of them and help a Democrat advance.\nRobocalls and radio ads funded by Democratic organizations have lavished praise on Gabbard’s wartime service, touting him as a man who has “traveled the world keeping America safe” and who “evacuated hundreds of Americans threatened during an African coup.”\nAt least one politcal watcher says Democrats are making a big mistake with their opposite-party financing.\n\n"That\'s the kind of game plan that really turns voters off. That money would be so much better spent just on get-out-the-vote efforts."\n- Jodi Balma, political science professor, Fullerton College\n\n"That\'s the kind of game plan that really turns voters off," Jodi Balma, a political science professor at Fullerton College, told the Register. "That money would be so much better spent just on get-out-the-vote efforts."\nWill the Democrats\' plan work? Orange County voters will find out next week.\nClick here for more from the Orange County Register.\n\xa0\n\nBradford Betz is an editor for Fox News.

"These damaging actions must be held to account. #StopTheBias"\n\nSadly, this is just the latest incident in a disturbing trend to slander conservatives. These damaging actions must be held to account. #StopTheBias https://t.co/6ztyuc772s— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) May 31, 2018\n\n\nEarlier in the week, McCarthy tweeted out a video of his speech to the Council for National Policy, in which he also criticized what he described as efforts to thwart conservative ideas.\n\n"Social media is being rigged to censor conservative voices," McCarthy tweeted. "We will not be silenced. #StopTheBias"\n\nSocial media is being rigged to censor conservative voices. We will not be silenced. #StopTheBias pic.twitter.com/vrxervxswL— Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) May 30, 2018\n\n\nThe\xa0Google\xa0error, first spotted by political strategist Eric Wilson, listed "Nazism" among other GOP ideologies, such as “Conservatism,” "Market liberalism,” “Fiscal conservatism,” and “Green conservatism.” The news was first reported by\xa0Vice News.\nGoogle\'s Knowledge Panel pulls information from various sources from across the web, including Wikipedia.\n\n\n\nFACEBOOK AND GOOGLE SLAMMED, ACCUSED OF BREAKING NEW GDPR PRIVACY LAW\n"Google should apologize for labeling Republicans nazis," Wilson tweeted. Wilson is the founder of LearnTestOptimize, which describes itself as "a community platform for professionals working at the intersection of marketing, technology, and politics."\nThe error has since been fixed. When reached for comment, a Google spokesperson told Fox News the error was likely the result of vandalism on one of its sources.\n"This was not the result of any manual change by anyone at Google. We don\'t bias our search results toward any political party. Sometimes people vandalize public information sources, like Wikipedia, which can impact the information that appears in search," the spokesperson said via email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson continued: "We have systems in place that catch vandalism before it impacts search results, but occasionally errors get through, and that\'s what happened here. This would have been fixed systematically once we processed the removal from Wikipedia, but when we noticed the vandalism we worked quickly to accelerate this process to remove the erroneous information.”\nPAYPAL NOW FULLY INTEGRATES WITH GOOGLE ACCOUNTS\nNevertheless, Donald Trump Jr. was among other conservative voices joining McCarthy in condemning the error.\n“This one from @google is even more disgusting than @instagram putting up a note that those searching a # of my name ‘could cause harm and even lead to death,’” Trump Jr. tweeted Thursday. “So much for free thought or speech!”\nSilicon Valley has come under fire in recent months for being seen as suppressing conservative voices, including from some senior members of the Republican Party.\nDuring recent testimony before Congress, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about the company\'s perceived "pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship." Cruz pointed to a recent in which Fox News Channel contributors Diamond and Silk who were temporarily banned from the platform.\nIn response to Cruz\'s question, Zuckerberg said that Diamond and Silk\'s ban was an error. “In that specific case, our team made an enforcement error and we have already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,” Zuckerberg\xa0said.\nGOOGLE SEARCH BUG IDENTIFIES RAPE VICTIMS IN PROMINENT CASES\nThe tech exec also noted that he was concerned about political bias in the tech industry, and he has tried to root that out at Facebook.\nA source familiar with Google\'s thinking noted that its systems are designed to detect if their information services have been vandalized.\n"These generally work well, but aren\'t perfect," the source said, and when the company is alerted of an error, it is fixed.\nFox News’ Chris Ciaccia contributed to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Kyrsten Sinema, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Republican Jeff Flake.\nUnder Arizona\'s "resign to run" law, Stanton had to resign from the mayorship by the end of May in order to maintain his federal candidacy.\n\nWednesday is the filing deadline for the race in Arizona\'s 9th Congressional District, which is centered in Tempe and includes parts of nearby communities, including Phoenix. The primaries are scheduled for Aug. 28, and the general election will be Nov. 6.\nStanton is expected to face at least two other Democrats, while as many as five Republicans are expected to run. Independent candidates and those representing smaller parties also will run.\nDemocrat Stanton has long criticized President Donald Trump, and has cited his opposition to Republican leadership in Washington as one of the key reasons for his run.\n\n\n\nPHOENIX MAYOR NOT HAPPY ABOUT TRUMP RALLY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"Arizonans deserve better than what we\'re getting from Washington, and there has never been a more consequential time in the fight to protect the middle class," Stanton said in October. "In Congress, I\'ll continue to do what we\'ve done in Phoenix --deliver real results that improve people\'s lives."\nIn August, Stanton criticized Trump for announcing a rally in Phoenix just a day after the president blamed "both sides" for weekend violence in Charlottesville, Va., between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators.\xa0\n"I am disappointed that President Trump has chosen to hold a campaign rally as our nation is still healing from the tragic events in Charlottesville," Stanton said in a statement at the time. "It is my hope that more sound judgment prevails and that he delays his visit."\nThelda Williams, who was the vice mayor, is now serving as Phoenix\'s mayor. She is expected to retain the post after a City Council vote in June, and would be up for election in November.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

The world, and North Korea in particular, has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth.”\n\n\n\nBut on Friday night, Trump tweeted that “very productive talks” about reinstating the summit were underway, and he said that June 12 could still be the date for such a meeting.\n\nWe are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nTRUMP WELCOMES STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA, SAYS TALKS TO REINSTATE SUMMIT \'PRODUCTIVE\'\xa0\nHe also told reporters Friday that “everybody plays games” and said: “They very much want to do it, we want to do it, we’ll see what happens.”\nTrump had also blasted Democrats, saying that they were “rooting against” the U.S. in its negotiations after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Kim was the winner from Trump\'s decision. \nThe North Koreans had also expressed willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,”\xa0 \nNorth Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said, according to Yonhap News\xa0(which cited the Korean Central News Agency) that Trump’s move to call off the summit highlighted the tensions between the two countries, further emphasizing the need for a meeting. The official added that Kim had been preparing for the summit. \nFox News’ Jennifer Bowman and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

In retaliation, he was branded the CIA\'s spy boss in Latin America by the head of the ruling socialist party. Hours earlier Maduro expelled the top American diplomat over the refusal of the U.S. to recognize his re-election.\n\nBut the arrival in Caracas on Friday of Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led to a surprise breakthrough. Maduro handed over Holt and his wife, Thamara Caleno, to Corker in what his government said was a goodwill gesture to promote dialogue and mutual respect between the two antagonistic governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Associated Press)\n\n\n\nHolt, 26, traveled to Caracas in June 2016 to marry a fellow Mormon he had met online while looking to improve his Spanish. The couple was waiting for Caleno\'s U.S. visa when they were arrested at her family\'s apartment in a government housing complex for what the U.S. considered trumped-up charges of stockpiling an assault rifle and grenades.\nAlthough Corker sealed the deal in a few tense hours in Venezuela\'s collapsing, crime-filled capital, the push to secure Holt\'s release began months earlier by Corker\'s top Latin American policy aide, Caleb McCarry, who both Corker and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, credited with leading the painstaking, behind-the-scenes negotiations.\n\n\n\nMcCarry leveraged a 15-year-old relationship with Maduro from their time together in the Boston Group, an informal gathering from across the political spectrum — Democrats, Republicans, socialists and capitalists — from both countries that worked discreetly to repair relations between the two countries following a coup in 2002 against then-President Hugo Chavez.\nRelationships formed in the now-defunct group were also instrumental in securing the release of another American accused of spying, documentary filmmaker Tim Tracy, who spent a month in a Venezuelan jail in 2013.\nMcCarry secretly traveled to Venezuela in February to discuss Holt\'s imprisonment with Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores. The U.S. Embassy was kept at an arm\'s length, for fear of derailing the talks, although the initiative was backed by Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon, who also knew Maduro from his days as political officer in Caracas at the outset of Hugo Chavez\'s revolution in the 1990s, several senior U.S. officials said.\nHolding McCarry\'s hand throughout the delicate talks was "Dracula" — Rafael Lacava, the governor of central Carabobo state and a trusted ally of Maduro who also was close to the Boston Group members.\n\nHolding McCarry\'s hand throughout the delicate talks was "Dracula" — Rafael Lacava, the governor of central Carabobo state and a trusted ally of Maduro who also was close to the Boston Group members.\n\nShortly after McCarry\'s visit, Lacava traveled to Washington in March to speak with several lawmakers including Hatch, Corker, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., according to several senior U.S. officials. All the officials agreed to discuss details of the negotiations only on condition of anonymity.\nHowever, after word of Lacava\'s visit was leaked by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has Trump\'s ear on policy toward Venezuela, the administration refused to meet with Maduro\'s envoy. Rubio warned that Lacava, who embraces the nickname Dracula for his habits of tweeting and patrolling around his state late at night in a Batmobile-like vehicle, was reportedly involved in money laundering, making him too toxic for a White House bent on punishing such criminal activity.\nWhen The Associated Press reported on the politically fraught backchannel in March, few imagined it would succeed.\nSpeculation swirled that the government was demanding an all-but-impossible prisoner exchange for Flores\' two nephews, who in 2016 were convicted in New York of drug trafficking, after it was learned that a government-connected Venezuelan tycoon was paying Holt\'s legal fees as well as those of the men branded the "narco-nephews."\nAt the same time, the Trump administration was intensifying a campaign to isolate Venezuela\'s government, sanctioning dozens of officials — including Maduro and Flores — for human rights abuses and drug trafficking while threatening a more crippling ban on oil shipments.\nAn official with the National Security Council stressed that nothing had been offered to secure Holt\'s release. President Donald Trump found out Friday that Holt would be released, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, while welcoming Holt\'s release, stressed that "U.S. policy toward Venezuela remains unchanged."\n"The United States stands steadfast in support of the Venezuelan people and their efforts to return to democracy," he said in a statement.\n\n"The United States stands steadfast in support of the Venezuelan people and their efforts to return to democracy." \n- Mike Pompeo, U.S. secretary of state \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Associated Press)\n\n\n\nAlfredo Romero, a lawyer who defends some of the opposition activists who were held alongside Holt, said that Maduro may be looking to win over some political sectors in the U.S. to temper Trump\'s hardline approach toward Venezuela.\n"Holt\'s continued imprisonment was a thorn in the side," he said.\nThe talks were encouraged by Pompeo, who met privately with Corker on Thursday morning and finalized details of the senator\'s trip ahead of testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the State Department budget. "We\'re doing all the right things. We have an American there that we desperately want to get back, Joshua Holt. And so know that we are engaged," Pompeo told lawmakers at the hearing.\nThe government of Cuba was also helpful in pressuring Maduro as well as former Spanish President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, one official said. Zapatero has been leading a three-year push to bring the government and opposition together to help resolve Venezuela\'s economic and political crisis.\nStill, when Corker left for Caracas on Friday it was still unclear if Maduro would follow through on his pledge to release Holt, the officials said.\nOn Saturday, a beaming Lacava could be seen in a video boarding the Venezuelan government plane that transported Holt to Washington wearing aviator glasses and a dark suit. He walked by the camera shouting "Dracula on the attack!" and flashing a "V for Victory" sign.\nIn a photograph taken at the airport in Caracas, Holt can be seen standing alongside Lacava holding a Venezuela national soccer team jersey emblazoned with the governor\'s name.\nThere was one last-minute scare. Taxiing down the runway, the plane suddenly slowed and its pilot turned back the craft to look into an instrument failure. When the once-unimaginable voyage resumed Holt had a big smile on his face, Corker told Trump in an Oval Office meeting Saturday night surrounded by the Utah man and his family.\n"Probably the only time anybody was ever happy that there was a bad instrument on an airplane," said Trump.\nGoodman reported from Bogota, Colombia.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\nInspector General Michael Horowitz’s office for more than a year has been reviewing the FBI’s handling of the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, but the release of the final report keeps getting pushed back. The release was originally anticipated in May. But last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee was forced to reschedule a hearing with Horowitz slated for Tuesday. The committee pushed that hearing to the following week, June 11, as committee members did not yet have a report to review, according to a congressional source.\xa0\n\nA draft version of the report, however, was submitted to the DOJ and FBI in mid-May so officials could identify any information that should be protected from disclosure.\nA source explained that the delay in the release could be tied to that process.\xa0\nHorowitz’s report is highly anticipated. He has looked at a variety of allegations, including whether it was improper for former FBI Director James Comey to make a public announcement about not recommending prosecution over the Clinton email arrangement.\xa0\n\n\n\nIt has been reported that the IG review also is expected to hit FBI leaders for moving too slowly to review a batch of Clinton emails discovered toward the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nHorowitz’s review has already put former top FBI official Andrew McCabe in legal jeopardy. The Justice Department’s internal watchdog sent a criminal referral for McCabe in April to the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington in response to Horowitz’s finding that McCabe leaked information to the press and later lied about it to Comey and federal investigators, prompting Attorney General Jeff Sessions to fire him in March.\nThe Washington Post reported that Comey has since been questioned by the U.S. attorney’s office as part of a McCabe investigation.\nIn November, Horowitz said his team had interviewed dozens of people and reviewed thousands of records in the course of the investigation.\nFox News’ Alex Pappas contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

In previous cycles, she spent millions on a labor union PAC and an environment group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also gave money to the Democratic Party group and over $400,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, Hillary Clinton’s fundraising committee.\nHer husband, who left Facebook in 2008, also used his wealth to oppose now-President Donald Trump, spending nearly $30 million to defeat him, according to the Free Beacon.\n"We just felt really compelled to, sort of, get off the sidelines and help ensure that the Democrats were able to win the election," Moskovitz said at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe revelation comes after reports that New York billionaire George Soros has funneled so far nearly $3 million into California’s district attorney races, supporting candidates that are in favor of progressive policies, including lower incarceration rates, crackdowns on police misconduct and changes in a bail system that they argue discriminates against the poor.\nSOROS SPENDS BIG IN CALIFORNIA’S DA RACES IN BID TO RESHAPE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM\nSoros reportedly spent more than $1.5 million on a political action committee to prop up the San Diego County candidacy of Geneviéve Jones-Wright, who pledged to form a police misconduct unit and attacked policies that “criminaliz[e] poverty.”\nShe openly embraced the support of Soros, saying “I love it!" during a recent fundraiser. "If he didn\'t take an interest in this campaign, it would be an even more uneven playing field,” she added, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nThe wealthy liberal donors are spending big on Diana Becton in Contra Costa County. Her challenger, a veteran prosecutor, slammed the support from the wealthy, describing them as “billionaires who apparently think Contra Costa\'s public safety is for sale.”\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Lorena González, follows recent deadly school shootings in Florida, Texas and other locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeattle Mayor Jenny Durkan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Associated Press)\n\n\n\nThe bill was forwarded to Seattle\'s City Council for consideration, the Seattle Times reported.\n\nIn 2016, Washington state enacted an "extreme risk" gun law that has allowed Seattle police officers to confiscate 43 weapons from citizens, the Times reported.\nThe gun-control movement in Washington state has been aided by former Microsoft executive and NFL team owner Paul Allen and other wealthy donors who have contributed cash to the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a Seattle-based lobbying group, TheGunMag.com reported.\nUnder Durkan\'s proposal, Seattle gun owners who fail to abide by the new rules would face a civil infraction if a minor or other “at-risk person” accesses a weapon that wasn’t properly secured, the Times reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Microsoft executive Paul Allen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Associated Press)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure would not apply to guns carried or owned by authorized users, only weapons that need to be stored.\n“The level of gun violence in our communities is not normal, and we can never think it is inevitable. We — especially our children — should not have to live like this,” Durkan said in a statement, the paper reported.\nDurkan, a Democrat, called on cities to “lead the way” as “Congress in the grip of the D.C. gun lobby and too many state legislatures” are “failing to act.”\nEarlier this year, Durkan clashed with the U.S. Justice Department after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions required some "sanctuary" cities to produce evidence that they were complying with federal immigration laws.\n"The federal government does not get to run our cities or convert our local law enforcement officials into immigration cops," Durkan wrote in response to Sessions.\nDurkan’s gun-control announcement comes just a day after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said he would support some gun control measures following last week\'s deadly shooting at a high school near Houston that left 10 people dead.\nIn March, thousands of students across the country staged walkouts to protest gun violence and call for stricter gun control measures on the one-month anniversary of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting that left 17 dead.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBenjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

New Yorkers know how to talk to other New Yorkers,” Holder said with a smile.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder visited New Hampshire Friday and said that he would decide on a Democratic presidential run by early next year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Fox News)\n\n\n\n“The idea of a challenge, yeah that kind of appeals to me,” he offered.\nHolder repeated his often-used line that he’ll decide on any Democratic presidential run by early next year.\n\n\n\n“I think the decision I make will be one that will be personal, whether or not I think I could contribute, whether I thought I could be a positive force. And I think it would really be something that I decide in a vacuum,” he said when asked by Fox News if a potential candidacy by former Vice President Joe Biden would weigh on his decision.\nBut he wondered if his style would play on the campaign trail, adding, “I’m a person who’s known as a guy who speaks his mind, and I wonder how that would resonate.”\n\n2020 WATCH: @EricHolder - in NH - asked about a hypothetical matchup with @realDonaldTrump - “Two guys from Queens. That would be interesting. New Yorkers know how to talk to other New Yorkers" Adds “I think the decision I make will be one that will be personal" #NHpolitics #FITN pic.twitter.com/HlEbv0TsuK— Paul Steinhauser (@steinhauserNH1) June 1, 2018\n\n\nHolder, who ran the Justice Department from 2009 until 2015 under then-President Barack Obama, joked that “there are some assumptions about why I’m here in New Hampshire.”\nStill, he maintained that the real reason he was in the state was in his capacity as chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee – which aims to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering. Holder warned that “our democracy is under attack,” adding “we’re up here to try to have an influence on state legislative races.”\nIn a separate interview on the eve of his New Hampshire visit, the nation’s first black attorney general said he wouldn’t label Trump a racist.\nBut he added, “The president and other members of his administration have tried to use race as a wedge issue to divide the American people, and it is something that I think is reprehensible. It is inconsistent with who we say we are as a people and it is not what we expect from somebody who is supposed to be the leader of the entire nation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the event in New Hampshire, Holder was asked to weigh in on the president’s pardon this week of conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza and Trump’s comment that he may commute the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.\n“I’m a little concerned about what’s going on,” Holder said. “I think the president is trying to send a message to some people who might be involved in the Russia investigation.”\nTrump and his allies, though, stand by the latest pardons. The White House said D\'Souza was "a victim of selective prosecution for violations of campaign finance law."\nJohn Dowd, former lead attorney for the president on the Russia probe, said, “I think the president’s use of his pardon power to right the ship and correct eight years of despicable injustice is brilliant and just what our founding fathers had in mind to check rogue prosecutions and agents and rigged prosecutions."\nDuring his speech, Holder focused on his redistricting mission. He urged that the process be taken “out of the hands of the politicians, because the reality that we have now is that politicians are picking their voters as opposed to citizens choosing who their representatives are going to be.”\nFollowing his "Politics and Eggs" appearance, Holder headlined a roundtable discussion on gerrymandering at the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s headquarters in Concord.\nHolder, who played basketball in high school and college, also weighed in on Game One of the NBA Finals, where the Cleveland Cavaliers\' JR Smith Thursday night made one of the costliest mistakes in pro-basketball history.\n“JR Smith, hang your head in shame,” he said.\nLater, Holder told reporters “if you’re a pro, [you\'re] supposed to remember what the score is.”\n“He’s a good player and we all make mistakes, but that was painful to watch,” Holder added.\xa0\nFox News\' Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

In 2016 as in 2008, Clinton entered the race as the establishment favorite, only to be sidelined by an insurgent political newcomer.\nDespite that admission by Rhodes, the book describes how Obama was distraught at the outcome.\n\n\n\n“What if we were wrong?” Obama reportedly asked aides, as he struggled to come to terms with Clinton\'s defeat.\nObama remained alternately optimistic and dejected, according to Rhodes, who has been feted as an\xa0aspiring novelist-turned national security wunderkind.\n “Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” Obama told aides,\xa0according to the memoir.\xa0“Maybe we pushed too far. ... Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”\nRhodes was promoted from presidential speechwriter to deputy national security adviser under Obama. He held that post during the raid that killed Usama bin Laden, as well as the U.S. intervention in Libya and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal.\nThe possibility that Trump could unravel that legacy apparently weighed on Obama, Rhodes writes.\nFMR OBAMA OFFICIALS FORM ANTI-TRUMP THINK TANK\n“I feel like Michael Corleone," Obama reportedly said, referencing "The Godfather" character as he prepared to hand over the White House to Trump. "I almost got out.”\nAccording to Rhodes, he and Obama were not aware that the FBI had begun an investigation into the Trump campaign\'s dealings with Russia until after the election.\nThe book also touches on some foreign-policy melodrama as Obama made his exit from the world stage, amid a shifting geopolitical climate that included Brexit and rising disenchantment with globalism.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had a "single tear in her eye" when she and Obama parted for the last time, and Obama noted that "she\'s all alone" to defend his liberal principles, according to Rhodes.\nBEN RHODES JOKES ABOUT GOP LEADERS\' \'OBITS\'\nIn footage from an HBO documentary recording on election night in 2016, Rhodes himself was seen sitting alone outside on a bench, haltingly repeating that the situation was difficult to "process."\n\nThis video of a shell-shocked Ben Rhodes after Hillary\'s election loss taken from a new HBO documentary is incredible. pic.twitter.com/EnJllQ5rBX— neontaster (@neontaster) May 30, 2018\n\n\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

Former Bill Clinton adviser, Mark Penn, gives his take.\n\n\n\n\nA lawyer for former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford has frustrated efforts by federal prosecutors to obtain information about a hush-money deal involving President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn public, Michael Avenatti, Clifford’s current attorney, has been among the most vocal critics of Michael Cohen, the lawyer who\xa0paid her $130,000 in October 2016\xa0to sign a nondisclosure agreement about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\nBut behind the scenes, Avenatti has slowed prosecutors’ efforts to discuss the nondisclosure agreement with Ms. Clifford’s former lawyer, these people say.\n\nPORN STAR LAWYER \'HOT-TEMPERED,\' WIFE SAYS IN DOCS DETAILING MESSY DIVORCE\nAvenatti also demanded to review documents investigators subpoenaed from Clifford’s former manager, they said.\nCohen is under criminal investigation for possible campaign-finance violations and bank fraud related to the payment to Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, and other business dealings, according to other people familiar with the probe. He has denied wrongdoing and hasn’t been charged with any crime. Trump has denied having sex with Clifford.\n\n\n\nAvenatti hasn’t yet acted on multiple requests from federal prosecutors in Manhattan for Clifford to waive the attorney-client privilege that prevents her former lawyer from discussing their communications about the nondisclosure deal, the people familiar with the matter said. In April, Avenatti, acting in his capacity as Clifford’s current lawyer, sent a cease-and-desist letter to her former lawyer, Keith Davidson, ordering him not to disclose any communications related to her, one of those people said.\nAvenatti made similar demands of Clifford’s former manager, Gina Rodriguez, who helped engineer the hush-money deal. Avenatti tried to block Rodriguez from providing her communications with Clifford to federal prosecutors until he had reviewed them, other people familiar with the matter said.\nAvenatti has told federal prosecutors he is trying to get Clifford to agree to waive her attorney-client privilege, but prosecutors have come to believe he is stringing them along, the people familiar with the matter said. The delays in responding to their requests to waive privilege aren’t seen as highly damaging to the probe but have frustrated investigators, they said.\nOn Monday, Avenatti said\xa0he and Clifford have “cooperated fully” with government prosecutors. He said he and Clifford are still determining whether to waive privilege and “ironing out the details,” including reviewing documents he has sought from Davidson.\n“We have already started producing documents to the government so any suggestion we are not cooperating is meritless,” Avenatti said.\nClick for more from The Wall Street Journal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

The opinion was penned by\xa0Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often the swing justice in tight cases.\xa0\nThe narrow ruling here focused on what the court described as anti-religious bias on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when it ruled against baker Jack Phillips.\xa0\n\n"The Commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion," Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion.\xa0\nREAD THE DECISION\nAttorney Michael Farris, president of the Alliance Defending Freedom which represented the baker, told Fox News that Phillips is “ecstatic” at the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaker Jack Phillips had refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Alliance Defending Freedom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Justice Kennedy has held that tolerance is a two-way street, and Jack Phillips was not tolerated by the Civil Rights Commission of Colorado,” he said.\xa0\nThe court said the broader issue, though, "must await further elaboration."\xa0\n“The reason and motive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious beliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the baker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the public, might have his right to the free exercise of religion limited by generally applicable laws," Kennedy wrote. "Still, the delicate question of when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an otherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in an adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the State itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought to reach."\nAt issue was a July 2012 encounter.\xa0At the time, Charlie Craig and David Mullins of Denver visited Masterpiece Cakeshop to buy a custom-made wedding cake. Phillips refused his services when told it was for a same-sex couple. The state civil rights commission sanctioned Phillips after a formal complaint from the gay couple.\nMullins has described their case as symbolizing “the rights of gay people to receive equal service in business … about basic access to public life."\xa0\nBut the Trump administration backed Phillips, who was represented in court by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit. He had lost at every step in the legal appeals process, bringing the case down to the Supreme Court\'s decision Monday.\xa0\n"Today’s decision means our fight against discrimination and unfair treatment will continue. We have always believed that in America, you should not be turned away from a business open to the public because of who you are. We brought this case because no one should have to face the shame, embarrassment, and humiliation of being told \'we don’t serve your kind here\' that we faced, and we will continue fighting until no one does," Craig and Mullins responded Monday.\nPhillips has said he lost business and had to let employees go because of the controversy.\nAnd he has maintained that it’s his choice: "It\'s not about turning away these customers, it\'s about doing a cake for an event -- a religious sacred event -- that conflicts with my conscience," he said last year.\nThe court in December specifically examined whether applying Colorado\'s public accommodations law to compel the local baker to create commercial "expression" violated his constitutionally protected Christian beliefs about marriage.\nBy wading again into the culture wars, the justices had to confront recent decisions on both gay rights and religious liberty: a 2015 landmark opinion legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide and a separate 2014 decision affirming the right of some companies to act on their owner\'s faith by refusing to provide contraception to its workers.\nThe Trump administration agreed with Phillips\' legal claims to a large extent. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October issued broad guidance to executive branch agencies, reiterating the government should respect religious freedom, which in the Justice Department\'s eyes extends to people, businesses and organizations.\nBut civil rights groups were concerned the conservative majority on the court may be ready to peel back protections for groups with a history of enduring discrimination – and predicted that giving businesses the right to refuse service to certain customers would undermine non-discrimination laws and hurt minorities.\xa0\nWhen the justices heard arguments in December, Kennedy was plainly bothered by certain comments by a commission member. The commissioner seemed "neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips\' religious beliefs," Kennedy said in December.\nLiberal justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan joined the conservative justices in the outcome. Kagan wrote separately to emphasize the limited ruling.\nBut Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.\n"I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips’ refusal to sell a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins," Ginsburg wrote.\xa0\nSarah Warbelow, legal director with the Human Rights Campaign, also stressed that the decision “is so narrow as to apply only to this particular baker.”\nFox News\' Mike Emanuel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

It\'s a big deal."\n\nBarack Obama: "I did not have scandals as president." That is most certainly not true.https://t.co/WsM3Gvubwk— Stephen Hayes (@stephenfhayes) May 25, 2018\n\n\n"No one in my White House ever got in trouble for screwing up as long there wasn\'t malicious intent behind it," Obama reportedly told the crowd.\nThe former president, who, along with his wife Michelle, just signed a multiyear producing deal with Netflix, echoed similar sentiments in February when he reportedly said in a closed-door speech at MIT that his administration "didn\'t have a scandal that embarrassed us ... Generally speaking, you didn\'t hear about a lot of drama inside our White House."\n\n\n\nFORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS: A LIST OF NOTABLE DEPARTURES\nMany Republicans would likely dispute Obama\'s scandal-free claim.\nFrom the response to the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya to the "Fast and Furious" gun-tracking operation in Mexico to the IRS scrutinizing conservative groups applications for tax-exempt status, the Obama administration often had its own controversies to cope with.\n\nNicole Darrah covers breaking and trending news for FoxNews.com.

Priestap was the boss of FBI official Peter Strzok, whose anti-Trump texts with a fellow agency employee have been probed by congressional investigators.\nPriestap\'s appearance comes as messages between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page are drawing fresh scrutiny because they indicate Priestap went to London two weeks before the FBI officially opened its investigation into Russia meddling in the election. A congressional source questioned to Fox News whether the trip was connected.\nIn a text on May 4, 2016, Strzok referenced how “Bill” is getting “back from London next week."\nFor more than a year, Horowitz has been reviewing FBI and DOJ actions related to the\xa0 investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama.\nEarlier this month, Horowitz announced that a draft report of his Clinton investigation review had been completed. He did not say when the results of the review would be officially released to the FBI, the DOJ and congressional committees.\nHorowitz’s investigation has looked at a variety of allegations, including whether it was improper for former FBI Director James Comey to make a public announcement about not recommending prosecution concerning the Clinton email arrangement.\nFox News’ Pamela\xa0K. Browne,\xa0Cyd\xa0Upson and Bradford Betz contributed to this report.\n\nCatherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

Its giant trust fund for inpatient care won\'t be able to cover projected medical bills starting at that point.\nThe report says Social Security will become insolvent in 2034 -- no change from the projection last year.\n\nThe warning serves as a reminder of major issues left to languish while Washington plunges deeper into partisan strife.\nMore than 62 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and surviving children receive Social Security benefits. The average monthly payment is $1,294 for all beneficiaries. Medicare provides health insurance for about 60 million people, most of whom are age 65 or older.\nTogether the two programs have been credited with dramatically reducing poverty among older people and extending life expectancy for Americans. Financed with payroll taxes collected from workers and employers, Social Security and Medicare account for about 40 percent of government spending, excluding interest on the federal debt.\n\n\n\nUnless lawmakers act, both programs face the future prospect of being unable to cover the full cost of promised benefits. With Social Security that could mean sharply reduced payments for some retirees, many of whom are already on tight budgets. For Medicare, it could mean that hospitals, nursing homes and other providers of medical care would be paid only part of their agreed-upon fees.\nMedicare\'s problems are widely seen as more difficult to solve. It\'s not just the growing number of beneficiaries with the baby boom generation moving into retirement. It\'s also the unpredictability of health care costs, which can be jolted by high-priced breakthrough cures, and which regularly outpace the overall rate of economic growth.\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on a promise that he wouldn\'t cut Social Security or Medicare, but he hasn\'t offered a rescue plan for either program.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, want to extend the social safety net by spending more on health care and education.\nBut government deficits keep rising, and the recent Republican tax-cut bill is only expected to add to the debt. That leaves less maneuvering room for policymakers when the day of reckoning finally arrives for Social Security and Medicare.\nIn principle, the U.S. is supposed to be paying forward its Social Security and Medicare obligations by building up trust funds to cover future costs. That money is invested in special government securities, which also collect interest. But when the money is actually needed to pay for benefits, economists say a government deep in debt could be hard pressed to make good.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has long been an advocate for overhauling the programs, introducing a voucher-like system for Medicare and calling for partially privatizing Social Security. But now that Ryan is leaving Congress, it\'s unclear who will take up the mantle for budget hawks. In any case, Republicans may have damaged their credibility on budget issues by voting to increase government spending and cut taxes.\nMany Democrats don\'t see a need for immediate action. Their formula is likely to involve tax increases to help keep the programs solvent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Mueller’s team also has given a copy to the federal judge overseeing the case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\nGIULIANI SAYS HE\'S COUNSELED TRUMP AGAINST FIRING SESSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked by Fox News if those two conditions are “red lines,” Giuliani said they definitely are.\n\n\n\nGiuliani also pushed back on reports that the legal team is doing “prep sessions” at the White House for a possible Trump interview with Mueller’s team. He said the legal team, rather, has been discussing with Trump the ground rules for a possible interview as well as daily developments pertaining to the case.\nGiuliani, though, said they will likely conduct some prep sessions with Trump, even if they decide against an interview -- because the legal team will have to write a report in response to Mueller’s findings, and they want to make sure they have a detailed account from the president.\nMeanwhile, Giuliani took issue with recent comments on Fox News by Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy.\nEarlier this week, the House oversight committee chairman argued that the FBI acted properly in its use of an informant to root out possible Russian meddling in the 2016 race.\xa0\n“I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got,” Gowdy said on “The Story with Martha MacCallum” on Tuesday, adding that the move had “nothing to do with Donald Trump.”\nGiuliani voiced skepticism at those remarks.\n“How could there not have been spying?” Giuliani asked, while questioning whether Gowdy saw all the documents related to the informant. Gowdy was part of a high-level briefing last week with DOJ and FBI officials regarding the informant.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nRudy Giuliani: Mueller probe should never have taken place\n\n\nGiuliani, speaking with Fox News on Thursday, also voiced concern about his client’s resumption of criticism against Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia probe.\nTrump took to Twitter on Wednesday to say he wishes he had named another attorney general.\nGiuliani said he wasn’t happy that Trump was going after Sessions again, expressing concern that the move could take focus away from the scrutiny on FBI conduct in 2016 and other issues.\n\nJohn Roberts currently serves as the chief White House correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined the network as a senior national correspondent in January 2011, based in the Atlanta bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

The government has proposed that terminations be allowed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with later abortions permitted only in limited cases.\n\nPro-abortion activists say the country\'s unusually strict laws simply encourage women to travel internationally to obtain abortions.\n\nWe\'re almost there: tomorrow you will get a chance to have your say on how we treat women in crisis. The polls open at 7am and close at 10pm.

Voting has already taken place on Ireland\'s offshore islands so that paper ballots can be taken to the mainland and counted in time.\n\n\n\nAN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS OF IRELAND\'S ABORTION REFERENDUM\nThere was good weather Friday morning in the capital, Dublin, and much of the country, a factor that could help the "yes" forces in favor of repeal get the heavy turnout they seek.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresiding officer Carmel McBride looks on as a woman casts her vote in the referendum on the 8th Amendment of the Irish Constitution\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Associated Press)\n\n\n\n"Yes" campaigners were handing out stickers at several major pedestrian crossroads Friday morning. Many people voted on their way to work and sported "I voted" buttons.\nGraffiti saying "Trust Women" by "yes" backers was scrawled on the pavement outside the North Grand Church polling station in Dublin as voting opened.\nBut letters to the editor published Friday in the Irish Independent newspaper contained emotional arguments urging voters to reject the repeal movement.\n"If we vote \'yes\', every unborn, wanted and unwanted, will have zero rights," wrote one woman. "I do not believe the smart people of Ireland want this unrestricted, abortion-on-demand bill. I will be voting no."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

The money is to aid in the “healing and recovery process.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“No student, parent or educator should have to experience the trauma suffered by so many at Santa Fe High School and other schools throughout the country,” said DeVos, according to KTRK. “Every day, the work of the Federal Commission on School Safety grows more urgent. We continue to focus on identifying proven ways to prevent violence and keep our students safe at school.”\nPresident Trump created a commission to review ways to make schools safer, naming DeVos to chair it. The panel on Thursday made its first field trip, to a Baltimore-area elementary school.\n\nThe Texas school shooting left eight students and two substitute teachers dead. Student Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, faces capital murder charges in the attack. Investigators say he carried out the massacre with a shotgun and a pistol that belonged to his father.\n“This a crucial first step in federal funding to help the Santa Fe High School community recover,” Sen.\xa0Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement. “I applaud Secretary DeVos for expediting\xa0this grant, and will continue to work to ensure Santa Fe High School receives the assistance it needs. I also remain committed to working with the governor, the administration and my congressional colleagues to put an end to these violent crimes and protect our students.”\nGov.

Mike Kennedy opens up about the race.\n\n\n\n\nWith Sen. Orrin Hatch’s retirement this year, two men are vying for the Republican nomination to replace him: Mitt Romney and Mike Kennedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Romney, Kennedy is wealthy -- just not nearly as much. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, Kennedy’s net worth is somewhere between $1.1 million and $2.6 million. In comparison, Romney’s is between $73.7 million and at least $271 million, according to the newspaper.\nWhoever wins will face Democrat Jenny Wilson, a city councilwoman, in the general election.\n\nIronically, Romney lost his Massachusetts Senate bid to a Kennedy -- Ted Kennedy -- in 1994.\nThe Republican duo is expected to face off in a debate on May 29.\nRead on for a look at the Republican candidates.\n\n\n\nMitt Romney\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump has already endorsed Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, for Senate in Utah.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Jim Urquhart)\n\n\n\nThis Senate race isn’t Mitt Romney’s first rodeo. He’s governed Massachusetts, ran for Senate and was named the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Additionally, Romney was president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee when it was behind the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.\nAt the Utah Republican convention earlier this year, Romney was unable to defeat Kennedy to avoid a July runoff election.\nBut Romney, 71, told Deseret News\xa0he’s already built relationships with dozens of members of the Senate over the years.\nRomney was one of President Trump’s harshest Republican critics during the 2016 election. According to Romney, the tension has softened, especially after he was considered for the secretary of state job.\n“I’m with his domestic policy agenda that he has put in place so far -- lower taxes, lower regulation, lower bureaucracy,” Romney told Deseret News. He added that Trump has been “pretty effective” so far.\nIn February, Trump endorsed Romney for the Senate seat.\nWhile Romney has spent much of his life in Massachusetts, he has considered Utah his home for at least 10 years, according to Deseret News. Utah has been Romney’s permanent residence since 2014. Romney said he and his wife plan to live in the state for “the rest of [their] lives.”\nWith now-House Speaker Paul Ryan as his running mate, Romney ran for president in 2012 as the Republican nominee, losing to incumbent President Barack Obama. However, Romney carried Utah in that election with more than 72 percent of the vote.\nRomney is a graduate of Brigham Young University and Harvard University. He would later co-found investment firm Bain Capital. He and his wife, Ann, have five children and 24 grandchildren, according to his campaign website.\nMike Kennedy\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from being a state lawmaker, Mike Kennedy has also practiced law and medicine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\n\n\nSince 2013, Mike Kennedy has served as a state representative in Utah. But the 49-year-old has held many jobs, including practicing law and medicine.\nDespite Romney’s profile, Kennedy forced a June runoff between the two candidates at the state GOP convention in April, finishing ahead of the former presidential nominee. But as The Spectrum reported, winning over the votes of Utahns is a different process than delegates at the Republican convention.\nKennedy’s main focus in the U.S. Senate would be the deficit, according to The Spectrum. He said a climbing deficit “would be our greatest national security threat.”\nOn his campaign website, Kennedy slammed the takeover of national monuments for “political control” instead of just “protecting historical and cultural sites.” He also said education decisions would be best determined by state and local governments as opposed to “unelected bureaucrats in Washington.”\nAccording to Deseret News, Kennedy only sponsored and passed one bill during the 2018 legislature: legislation that mandates the Utah Driver License Division and State Board of Education inform student drivers about how to improve air quality and vehicle emissions. He was also asked to lead the Utah School Safety Commission in wake of recent mass school shootings that have plagued the nation, according to the newspaper.\nIn the legislature, he serves on the Health and Human Services, House Rules and Transportation committees, among others.\nKennedy said he was raised by a single parent “in less than fortunate circumstances," adding that he "worked hard to find success and provide a better life for his family.”\nKennedy graduated from Brigham Young University before attending Michigan State University for medical school. He would later earn a law degree from BYU.\xa0\nHe and his wife have eight children.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

They did not discuss that location with Mueller.\nThe Wall Street Journal earlier reported the details of the deal that came close, but was never made, amid an internal debate on the president’s legal team about the wisdom of Trump sitting for a Mueller interview.\n\nAccording to a source, together with Mueller, Trump’s attorneys penciled in Jan. 27 as a possible date for an interview.\xa0 Mueller said he would likely need about a half a day, the person said.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\'Spygate\': Trump unveils new nickname for Russia probe\n\n\nThe special counsel’s office declined to comment.\nTrump’s attorneys, at the time, wanted to know what topics Mueller was looking to cover in a meeting and why he thought it necessary to interview the president at all.\xa0At the time, then-Trump lawyer John Dowd was putting together a legal argument that Mueller had a high bar to clear if he wanted to talk to Trump face-to-face.\xa0\n\n\n\nRUDY GIULIANI TAKES OVER TALKS WITH MUELLER ON POSSIBLE TRUMP INTERVIEW\nMueller told Trump’s attorneys that he wanted the session on the record with a court reporter and under oath, the source said.\nTrump’s attorneys felt that Mueller hadn’t made a strong enough case during the meeting to justify an interview with the president – so they sent him a lengthy letter listing arguments against doing an interview. The letter, about 20 pages long, was put together by Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and his assistants.\nThe intention was to “push back against Mueller – make him work and prove that he needed to talk to the president,” the source said.\xa0\nThe legal team also “wanted to know what was on Mueller’s mind” after all the material they and the White House provided to the special counsel. The source says Trump was “very pleased” with the letter.\nThe legal team’s eventual advice to the president was that “no interview was warranted or justified,” but they “didn’t slam the door” on the idea.\nIn their next meeting, Mueller told the president’s legal team that Trump was not a “target” of the investigation, the source said. Trump’s attorneys kept pushing Mueller for more specifics on what he wanted to ask, and eventually said they would need the list of questions.\xa0Mueller provided those in early April.\xa0\nNegotiations over a possible interview are ongoing to this day.\nFox News’ Alex Pappas contributed to this report.\n\nJohn Roberts currently serves as the chief White House correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC). He joined the network as a senior national correspondent in January 2011, based in the Atlanta bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Rod Blagojevich, left.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\n“I’ll tell you another one … there’s another one that I’m thinking about. Rod Blagojevich -- 18 years in jail for being stupid and saying things that every other politician, you know that many other politicians say,” Trump told reporters. “And if you look at what he said, he said something to the effect like \'what do I get\' … stupid thing to say.”\nThe former Democratic governor, who was a contestant on Trump\'s "Celebrity Apprentice" in 2010, began his 14-year prison sentence in 2012 after being convicted of corruption. Blagojevich\'s scheduled release date is in 2024.\xa0\n\n\n\nBlagojevich was governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2009, when he was impeached and convicted on corruption charges over allegations he took bribes for political appointments—including to the open U.S. Senate seat of former President Barack Obama.\nTrump suggested he was more interested in “curtailing his sentence” than a full pardon.\xa0\n“I am seriously thinking about – not pardoning – but I am seriously thinking of a curtailment of Blagojevich," Trump said.\xa0\nThe president also said he would consider pardoning Stewart, saying she "used to be one of my biggest fans."\xa0\n“And there are others. I think to a certain extent Martha stewart was harshly and unfairly treated. And she used to be my biggest fan in the world … before I became a politician," Trump said. "But that’s ok I don’t view it that way.”\xa0\nStewart was convicted in 2004 of obstructing justice and lying to the government as part of an insider trading case. At the time, former FBI Director James Comey was the federal prosecutor who charged Stewart.\xa0\nThe president\'s comments come after an early morning tweet announcing that he would pardon D\'Souza.\xa0\n“Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!” the president tweeted Thursday morning.\nD\'Souza told Fox News he received a call from the president on Wednesday to notify him of the decision.\xa0\n"I am thrilled and relieved and elated and as an immigrant in America, my American dream has been under something of a cloud, so I\'m very relieved to have that cloud lifted," D\'Souza told Fox News on Thursday.\xa0\nD\'Souza said he and Trump spoke for about 10 minutes, calling it a "very pleasant and very exciting call."\xa0\n"President Trump told me he felt I had been treated very unfairly and he felt that I was an important voice for America," D\'Souza said. "He wanted to clean my record and adhere to continue doing what I\'m doing."\xa0\nThe conservative filmmaker had pleaded guilty in 2014 for donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, allegedly going over the contribution limit by directing other donors to give to her. He was sentenced to five years of probation and eight months in a halfway house, and paid a $30,000 fine.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Another hearing will be held in July and then a vote in September, if approved by the board.\n\nCurrent laws allow parents, who don’t wish to identify the gender of a newborn, to designate their child’s sex as undermined or unknown. The new “X” category would be something adults could choose for their own birth certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther states across the U.S. have a third gender option in their birth certificates, including California, Oregon and Washington. In Washington, D.C., a third gender option is available on drivers’ licenses.\nDe Blasio and Johnson said the new proposal is in the spirit of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month that spans throughout June.\n\n\n\n"Pride Month is a time to celebrate how far we\'ve come in the fight for equality, and re-affirm our commitment to protecting all New Yorkers from discrimination," the New York mayor said. "This proposal will allow transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers to live with the dignity and respect they deserve, and make our City fairer."\nJohnson, a Democrat, introduced legislation in 2014 that removed a requirement for a person looking to change his or her gender designation on a birth certificate to have undergone sex reassignment surgery.\nBut even after that, the process still required a medical or mental health professional to fill out an affidavit or affirmation saying the applicant\'s gender identity was more accurately reflected by changing the gender designation.\n\n"This proposal will allow transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers to live with the dignity and respect they deserve, and make our City fairer."\n- NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio\n\nThe legislation being introduced this week also would remove that requirement, and allow people filing for the change to submit their own affidavit saying it was to affirm their gender identity.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

John Bussey of the Wall Street Journal shares insight on \'America\'s News HQ.\' \n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump on Saturday said “UNFAIR” trade practices can “no longer be tolerated,” noting the U.S. “must be treated fairly.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president suggested that the country’s trade practices prior to his administration was “not Free or Fair Trade,” but “Stupid Trade.”\n“The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!” Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe president’s tweets come after the administration’s decision this week to slap tariffs on allies Canada, Mexico and the European Union’s steel and aluminum shipments to the U.S., resulting in an impending trade war. The White House also threated China with separate tariffs.\nEurope, Mexico, Canada and China have vowed to hit back at U.S. goods.\nMexico plans to retaliate against the tariffs by targeting U.S. cheese, among other products, while Europe is threatening to target Kentucky bourbon and Wisconsin-based motorcycles Harley-Davidson. The jeans maker Levi Strauss is also on the EU’s target list.\n\n\n\nThe president initially introduced tariffs on steel and aluminum in March but carved out an exception for Canada and Mexico during North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations.\nThe president\xa0instituted tariffs\xa0of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports earlier this year.\n"We will not place any new tax on products made in the United States," Trump said in March. "You don\'t want to pay a tax, bring your plants to the United States."\nHe added: "We\'re urging all companies to buy American. That\'s what we want. Buy American."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

For some of it we had the video but once they were inside we had no video, just an audio connection. ... And some of you who have followed this may know one of the helicopters hit the tail going into the courtyard and got disabled ... [but] because of the incredibly careful planning we didn’t leave anybody behind.”\n\n"I was one of those who recommended the president launch what was a very risky raid."\n- Hillary Clinton, on the campaign trail in Iowa, January 2016\n\nClinton has been the subject of other recent books dealing with the former U.S. secretary of state and U.S. senator\'s 2016 campaign loss.\nBen Rhodes, a former adviser to Obama, details in his memoir, “The World as It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House,” that they’d run against Clinton in 2008 with the same message that Republican candidate Donald Trump would use eight years later.\nThat message: “She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change,” Rhodes writes in a preview featured in the New York Times.\nAnother memoir, “Chasing Hillary,” by Times reporter Amy Chozick, who followed Clinton on the campaign trail, writes of the Democratic nominee’s reaction the moment she learned of her defeat to Trump.\n“’I knew it. I knew this would happen to me,’ she said, ... They were never going to let me be president,’” an excerpt in the New York Times reads.\nBut who was Clinton referring to as "they"? The former candidate has gone on to blame various groups for her election defeat -- including Democratic socialists, the "vast right-wing conspiracy," James Comey, white men and the press.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

She was sentenced to 35-years in prison in 2013 for violating the Espionage Act and leaking sensitive information to WikiLeaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the alarming messages posted by Chelsea Manning on Twitter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Twitter)\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama commuted her sentence in his last day in office in 2017.\nThe candidate for the U.S. Senate posted a picture that appeared to show a person looking down to a street from atop a building.\n\n\n\n"I\'m sorry - I tried - I\'m sorry I let you all down," Manning wrote in one of the now-deleted tweets, The Daily News reported. "I’m not really cut out for this world - I tried adapting to this world out here but I failed you - I couldn\'t do this anymore - I can take people I don\'t know hating me but not my own friends," she added. "I tried and I\'m sorry about my failure."\nMany on social media quickly jumped on her frightening tweets, asking friends to contact Manning or the authorities to ensure her safety.\n\n** chelsea is safe. she is on the phone with friends, thanks everyone for your concern and please give her some space— Chelsea E. Manning (@xychelsea) May 28, 2018\n\n\nThe alarming messages came after a debate on social media with Dawn Ennis, a former ABC News assignment editor who criticized Manning’s remark that “voting won’t change anything.”\nEnnis, who came out as transgender in 2013, posted on Twitter, “I am looking forward to an update on Chelsea’s well being in the morning. I truly wish her well. And I expect a new wave of online anger and hate to greet me, too. Be kind to all those who struggle. I myself will work harder to bear that in mind.”\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Mike Huckabee (R-Ark.) discusses President Trump\'s tweet about where Barack Obama was amid reports of an FBI informant in the president\'s 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama was veritably shell-shocked in the wake of Donald Trump\'s election victory in 2016, and even asked aides\xa0“What if we were wrong?” as he struggled to come to terms with Hillary Clinton\'s defeat, former adviser Ben Rhodes writes in a new memoir coming out in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book, titled "The World As It Is," highlights efforts by Obama\'s brain trust to reassure him that he would have won re-election if he were allowed to run for a third term.\xa0\nBut Obama remained alternately optimistic and dejected, according to Rhodes, who has been feted as an\xa0aspiring novelist-turned national security wunderkind.\n\n“Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” Obama told aides, according to the memoir.\xa0“Maybe we pushed too far. ... Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”\n“There are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth," the book quotes Obama saying in a message to Rhodes the day after the election.\n\n"Maybe this is what people want."\n- Former President Barack Obama, trying to understand Donald Trump\'s election win\n\nDays later, Obama reportedly came back down to Earth, saying: “Maybe this is what people want. I’ve got the economy set up well for him. No facts. No consequences. They can just have a cartoon.”\n\n\n\nRhodes was promoted from presidential speechwriter to deputy national security adviser under Obama. He held that post during the raid that killed Usama bin Laden, as well as the U.S. intervention in Libya and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal.\nThe possibility that Trump could unravel that legacy apparently weighed on Obama, Rhodes writes.\nFMR OBAMA OFFICIALS FORM ANTI-TRUMP THINK TANK\n“I feel like Michael Corleone," Obama reportedly said, referencing "The Godfather" character as he prepared to hand over the White House to Trump. "I almost got out.”\nAccording to Rhodes, he and Obama were not aware that the FBI had begun an investigation into the Trump campaign\'s dealings with Russia until after the election.\nThe book also touches on some foreign-policy melodrama as Obama made his exit from the world stage, amid a shifting geopolitical climate that included Brexit and rising disenchantment with globalism.\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had a "single tear in her eye" when she and Obama parted for the last time, and Obama noted that "she\'s all alone" to defend his liberal principles, according to Rhodes.\nBEN RHODES JOKES ABOUT GOP LEADERS\' \'OBITS\'\nIn footage from an HBO documentary recording on election night in 2016, Rhodes himself was seen sitting alone outside on a bench, haltingly repeating that the situation was difficult to "process."\n\nThis video of a shell-shocked Ben Rhodes after Hillary\'s election loss taken from a new HBO documentary is incredible. pic.twitter.com/EnJllQ5rBX— neontaster (@neontaster) May 30, 2018\n\n\nBut in his memoir, Rhodes says he should have predicted the result.\n“I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have seen it coming,” he writes. “Because when you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change.”\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

Jon Tester, an endangered incumbent Democrat, in the fall -- and President Trump’s effect on the Republican Party is showing among them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombat veteran Troy Downing, Judge Russ Fagg, state Sen. Albert Olszewski and state auditor Matt Rosendale have all thrown their hats into the ring for the Republican nomination for Senate. And although Tester, the incumbent, has already raised a lot of money for the election, whoever emerges from this group of men stands a good chance in the general election, Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor told Fox News.\nFox News’ considers the Montana Senate race to be one of eight toss ups in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nA look at the Republican candidates\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left, Russell Fagg, Troy Downing, Matt Rosendale and Al Olszewski are competing for the chance to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this fall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Matt Volz)\n\n\n\nWhile there hasn’t been much polling ahead of the June 5 primary election, Rosendale, 57, has emerged as a potential frontrunner, Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor, told Fox News. Rosendale has the endorsement of Republican Sens. Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz. Like Paul, Rosendale bills himself as a libertarian-leaning candidate. \xa0\nRosendale, former majority leader in the state Senate, was elected as Montana’s state auditor in 2016.\n\n\n\nFagg is a fourth-generation Montanan with some name recognition, as his father was involved with local politics as well, Parker said. Fagg is genteel and someone who would be difficult to attack during debates, Parker said, but he has “demonstrated some aggressiveness in this primary.”\nBut Fagg has a long judicial record, and opponents could point to a case to fit an argument that he isn’t tough on crime.\nOlszewski is “somebody who could be a very attractive candidate,” Parker said. An Air Force veteran and father to six, Olszewski was first elected to the state legislature in 2014 as a state representative. Now, he’s a state senator.\n“He’s well-regarded among Republicans in the know and in the party, but he’s had limited exposure to the electorate,” Parker said, noting that Olszewski hasn’t run television or radio ads like his GOP opponents.\nA businessman, Downing founded a tech company that eventually merged with Yahoo. After 9/11, Downing joined the Air Force and served in Afghanistan. His work with veterans, too, has made him a potential dark horse candidate, Parker said.\nTRUMP CALLS ON TESTER TO RESIGN OVER RONNY JACKSON ALLEGATIONS\nBut Downing isn’t originally from Montana, Parker pointed out. And his home in Big Sky, Montana, where the private Yellowstone Club ski resort is, stands in stark contrast to the more rural Montanans.\xa0\nDowning has the support of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump’s children. He’s also “the one who looks most Trumpian” with his business credentials.\n“If there’s a Trump guy, it’s him,” Parker said of Downing.\n\nWhat an incredible evening w/@DonaldJTrumpJr & @EricTrump! They look great in Troy Downing for U.S. Senate hats! #mtsen #mtpol pic.twitter.com/xjnTz0fcpd— Troy Downing - U.S. Senate (@TroyDowningMT) November 4, 2017\n\n\n“It’s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump,” Saldin said.\xa0“It’s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana.”\nEven Fagg, who is considered a favorite among the more establishment Republicans in Montana, has tacked a little more in the direction of Trump, Saldin said, pointing to ads that have been deemed “aggressive."\nTrump won Montana by about 56 percent in 2016. In comparison, 2008 Republican nominee John McCain took the state with about 50 percent.\n\n“It’s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump,” Saldin said. “It’s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana.”\n- Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor \n\nIt’s no secret that the four Republican candidates lack some of the perks that come with name recognition. In fact, the “best two candidates” for beating Tester aren’t even running in this election, several political scientists in the state have said.\nRyan Zinke, a former U.S. congressman, joined Trump’s Cabinet when he was appointed secretary of the Interior Department last year. And the state’s attorney general, Tim Fox, decided to forgo the race, presumably to run for governor, Saldin said.\nBut even without that star power, the four candidates still stand a chance because of something next to their name: Republican.\n“Anytime you’re running as a Republican in Montana statewide, you’ve got a shot,” Saldin said. “I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion that Tester wins this.”\nA look at Tester\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Jon Tester (right) leaves the Capitol following votes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n\n\nTester, 61, is a more conservative Democrat who has already emphasized his record of voting for more than a dozen bills signed into law by Trump in his first television ad. In an age of increasingly polarizing politics, Tester’s 30-second spot didn’t critique the president.\nWhoever wins the Republican primary needs to tap into what made Trump so successful in rural areas during the 2016 election, such as appealing to voters who believe politicians aren’t “speaking to me,” Parker said. The Republican candidate can “embrace the idea of the perception of left behind rural voters and speak to that.”\nTESTER FEELING HEAT FROM TRUMP IN MONTANA SENATE RACE\n“For Republicans to win the general, they need somebody who can kind of stem the flow of rural voters [siding with Democrats or not voting at all] and keep them in the Republicans’ column,” Parker said. “Candidates need to be making inroads in suburban areas -- pick off suburban voters and be attractive to rural voters as well.”\nTrump\xa0went after Tester earlier this year during the kerfuffle over his pick to lead the Veterans Affairs Department. Adm. Ronny Jackson, who was the president’s physician, withdrew his name from consideration for the Cabinet post following\xa0allegations about his prescription-drug practices and use of alcohol. Jackson was also accused of wrecking a government vehicle while intoxicated.\n\n“Candidates need to be making inroads in suburban areas -- pick off suburban voters and be attractive to rural voters as well.”\n- Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor\n\nThe allegations were collected by Tester’s office; he is the top Democrat on the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee.\nThe White House disputed the accusations, and Trump called for Tester’s resignation in April.\n“The great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being,” Trump said in a series of tweets. “Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!”\nTrump’s attack on Tester could hurt his chances in the fall.\n“I think that’s the one thing that’s gone wrong for Tester,” Saldin said of Trump’s criticisms. “So much has gone right for Tester. The thing with Jackson, it does threaten to hurt him, especially if Trump follows up and comes out here to campaign directly against him.”\nSaldin said the Tester campaign needed to “keep Trump at arm’s length and just emphasis the areas in which Tester and Trump have been able to work together, especially on veterans’ issues.”\nAbout 87,000 veterans live in Montana, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Along with Alaska and Maine, Montana is considered to have the most veterans per capita living in the state.\nOn the other hand, Parker has argued Trump’s attacks might actually help Tester’s campaign. Tester is considered a strong advocate for veterans in Montana, Parker wrote for The Washington Post, and his fight with Trump over a beleaguered pick to lead the already embattled veterans’ agency could further prove his dedication to those who served the country.\n“The way Democrats win in Montana,” Parker said, is by having candidates who are “personable and well-liked and are pretty solid on things like guns and social issues.

Trump shared the suggestion and added, “He is a great guy!”\n\n"@KathyCeurter: @realDonaldTrump please Mr.Trump make @SenatorJeffSessions your VP. He is a perfect running mate."  He is a great guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2016\n\n\nThe nomination\nTrump introduced Sessions “with great pride” as the country’s attorney general on Feb. 9, 2017.\n“He’s a man of integrity, a man of principle, and a man of total, utter resolve,” Trump said at the time.\n\nCongratulations to our new Attorney General, @SenatorSessions! pic.twitter.com/e0buP1K83z— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017\n\n\nWHO IS IN TRUMP\'S CABINET?\n“These dangerous times require a determined attorney general, which is what Jeff is,” Trump said. “Jeff understands that the job of attorney general is to serve and protect the people of the United States, and that is exactly what he will do, and do better than anybody else can. He’s trained better for it than anybody else.”\nThe conflict\nIn March 2017, Trump initially defended Sessions as he was criticized for meeting with a Russian ambassador. \xa0\n\nJust out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\n\nBut since, Trump has lambasted his attorney general on social media and to press, calling him “beleaguered” and slamming him for not investigating Clinton – even though Trump himself said after he was elected that he didn’t plan to pursue an investigation into her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\nTrump told The New York Times in August 2017 that he wouldn’t have picked Sessions to lead the Justice Department if he knew he would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.\n“Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” he said.\nTrump repeated that line of attack in a series of tweets in May. The president quoted comments from House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, a Republican, who disputed suggestions that a conversation Trump had with Sessions about his recusal strayed into obstruction of justice territory.\n“I think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney Gen. Jeff Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward,” Gowdy told CBS News. “If I were the president and I picked someone to be the country’s chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘Oh, by the way, I’m not going to be able to participate on the most important case in the office,’ I would be frustrated too.”\n“There are lots of really good lawyers in the country. He could have picked someone else,” Gowdy continued.\nTrump quoted Gowdy’s remarks and added, “And I wish I did!”\n\nRep.Trey Gowdy, “I don’t think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward.

After initially accepting Kim’s invitation, Trump announced he was pulling out of the summit in a letter to the North Korean leader in May.\nBut since then, as talks between officials have continued, Trump\xa0said the meeting is back on, according to plan.\xa0\n\nRead on for a look at how the meeting came about, fell apart and came back together.\nTrump accepts invitation\nTrump accepted Kim’s invitation to meet in early March, the White House said.\n\n\n\n“President Trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would eventually meet with Kim when conditions were right,” then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. “And I think in the president’s judgement that time has arrived now.”\nDate, time and place is set\nIt wasn’t until May when the date for the summit was publicly set: June 12. Trump said in a tweet that he and Kim would “both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace.”\n\nThe highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2018\n\n\nThe meeting was scheduled to take place in Singapore.\nLeaders waffle on meeting\nLater in May, Trump began to suggest a reverse in course\xa0on whether the meeting would take place as North Korean officials threatened to cancel talks.\n“If it doesn’t happen, maybe it will happen later. You never know about deals. I’ve made a lot of deals,” Trump said on May 22. “You never really know. It may not work out for June 12.”\nThe comments came after a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House.\nLater, after Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News Kim had “asked” for the meeting, North Korea’s vice foreign minister accused the U.S. of “misleading the public opinion as if we have invited them to sit with us.”\n“We will neither beg the U.S. for dialogue nor take the trouble to persuade them if they do not want to sit together with us,” Choe Sun Hui reportedly said.\nTrump backs out\nTrump announced on May 24 that he decided to pull out of the summit in an open letter to Kim.\n“I was very much looking forward to being there with you,” Trump wrote. “Sadly ... I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting.”\n“I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me, and ultimately, it is only dialogue that matters,” Trump continued. “Some day, I look very much forward to meeting you.”\n\nA letter from the President to Chairman Kim Jong Un: "It is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting." pic.twitter.com/3dDIp55xu1— The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 24, 2018\n\n\nThe White House also revealed that North Korean officials had stopped coming to recent meetings regarding the summit.\nNorth Korea reverses course\nAfter Trump pulled out of the summit, North Korea said it was still willing to come to the table.\n“We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the U.S. and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said on May 25, according to Korean Central News Agency.\nTrump offers hope for the meeting\nTrump suggested a summit could still take place in June in a May 25 tweet.\n“We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit, which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th, and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date,” Trump said.\n\nWe are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nSouth and North Korea meet again\nKim and Moon held a surprise meeting on May 26 on the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone reportedly to discuss a path forward for the summit with Trump.\nAides travel to North Korea, Singapore\nTrump said U.S. officials arrived in North Korea for discussions about the summit on May 27. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, “We continue to prepare for a meeting between the President and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.”\n“Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself,” Trump tweeted. “I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!”\n\nOur United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2018\n\n\nU.S. officials also reportedly met with Kim Chang Son, the North Korean leader’s chief of staff, in Singapore on May 28.\n“We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea,” Trump said in a tweet the following day. “Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more.”\n\nWe have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nNew York City meetings\xa0\nKim Yong Chol, one of Kim’s closest aides and North Korea’s former military intelligence chief, met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York City on May 30.\n\nGood working dinner with Kim Yong Chol in New York tonight. Steak, corn, and cheese on the menu. pic.twitter.com/1pu4K3oym7— Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) May 31, 2018\n\n\nThe two are also expected to engage in a “day full of meetings” on May 31, according to the White House.\nPompeo met with Kim in April, before he was sworn in as secretary of state, Trump has said.\nMeeting is back on\nAfter being delivered a personal letter from Kim by a North Korean official at the White House, Trump announced the June 12 summit was back on.\xa0\n“We\'ll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore," the president told reporters after the meeting that lasted for more than an hour.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

The Navy escalated 9.3 percent, while the Air Force documented a 9.2 percent jump and the Army 8.4 percent.\nAn overall 6,769 men and women reported assaults, a rise from 6,172 a year earlier, and the highest number since 2006, which was the first year such data was collected.\nLIFE AFTER ISIS: CHRISTIANS SAY THEY CAN\'T GO HOME WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\nHowever, Pentagon officials stated that they see the number —\xa0the highest for the seventh year in a row —\xa0as fortitude that more victims are buoyed to report such aggressions to their superiors, while at the same time they acknowledge that much work lies ahead.\n“While the progress we have seen provides some comfort, we neither take it for granted nor are we under any illusions that our work is done,” Elizabeth Van Winkle, a psychologist and executive director of the Pentagon’s Office of Force Resiliency said. “In fact, we see this progress as cautionary and recognize that one of the greatest threats to progress is complacency.”\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

Here is obvious evidence that the Golden State is a one-party state in ways that not even Rhode Island or Alabama could muster.\xa0  These preliminary data are subject to official reversal by California secretary of state, but the larger message is irrefutable: The value of partisan affiliation is dropping like a rock in America’s most populous state.\xa0  That should come as no surprise since there has been a push for more than a decade to get away from the partisanship that many in California and across the country say is to blame for poor government and an inability to address pressing issues.\xa0  The most aggressive step taken by California was to end partisan primaries. Since 2012 voters of all registrations participate in the state’s June primary elections with the top two finishers, regardless of affiliation, meeting up for a runoff in November.\xa0  This was the brain child of moderates, both Republican and Democrat, who observed that the primary system as constituted in most of the country provides too great an incentive for extremism. By essentially eliminating primaries, California reformers reasoned, they would eliminate the extremism that primaries produce.\xa0  This would be something like saying that you only find out about having cavities when you go to the dentist so you stop going to the dentist all together. Problem solved.\xa0  Partisan affiliation for most of American history was a function of class, ethnicity and geography. You were a Democrat or Republican because everyone you knew was one, just like your father and grandfather and great grandfather… There were liberal rock-ribbed Republicans in the Northeast and conservative yellow dog Democrats in the Deep South.\xa0  But the rise of a truly national media in the form of talk radio, cable news and, most of all, the internet, has facilitated what political scientist\xa0Mo Fiorina\xa0says is a better “sorted” electorate. The conservative Republican base has driven out liberals while the liberal Democratic base has driven out conservatives, and those who harbor dissenting views but still remain have strong incentives to remain quiet.\n\nSo many voters feel alienated these days not because the parties have become more polarized but because the parties have become so homogenous. People have tangled oftentimes seemingly contradictory views and seldom fit into narrow ideological silos. And as the parties have become more ideological it has deepened the sense of alienation for many.  Parties were less ideological 50 years ago and tended to reflect coalitions of regional factions that could cobble together politically competitive efforts. Now parties are more ideological since the old cultural bonds that kept people in their political lanes have substantially broken down. If anybody tell you that “all politics is local,” tell them to look at the ads politicians are running in 2018 midterms.\xa0  In this well-sorted space, there is greater incentive for ideological extremism. Incumbent members of Congress who would have once run for re-election on their own records and value to the district now race to the right or left to accommodate the demands of activist voters keyed up on immigration or impeachment or whatever is causing the deepest electric thrum to vibrate through the electorate.\xa0  Partisan primaries may reveal those trends, but they are hardly the cause of them, as Californians are beginning to find out.\xa0  It is not hard to imagine that within the next decade the number of unaffiliated voters will also grow beyond the number of Democrats. Without the incentive of primary participation who wants to join a political party? Neither brand is particularly popular – for good reason – and partisanship in general has a bad reputation.\xa0  So what does that future look like? Probably more chaotic but even more factious. When these red and blue dinosaurs die off, they will not be replaced by new megafauna but rather a profusion of small scavengers.\xa0  Over here are the Democratic socialists. Over there are the white nationalists. Up yonder is La Raza. Down there are the Libertarians.  Many Americans have long yearned for a “third party.” They came awfully close in 1992 with\xa0Ross Perot’s aggressive pragmatism and flipcharts, and the desire for something that seems like a compromise between conservatives and liberals hasn’t abated. But the problem is you don’t get one more party. You get 10 more or 20 more.\xa0  Once we decide that we want “something else” than the two mainstream offerings it throws wide the doors to the kind of narrow-interest politics that bedevil many other nations.\nImagine the California primary of 2028 in which the top two finishers in a crowded field each claim less than a fifth of the vote and in November voters are left to choose between two candidates who got there by being ablest to energize the loudest, crankiest subset of supporters. Folks would be begging for authoritarian oligarchs after a few cycles of that.\xa0  There are lots of things that could be done to make America’s two-party system better.\nThe combination of misguided but well-intentioned campaign finance reforms that weakened national parties and a Supreme Court decision that empowered unaccountable outside groups has been particularly damaging. There may be some solutions there. And certainly the improved ability of partisans through voter data to draw ever more tortured congressional districts needs some consideration, too.\n\n\n\nBut whatever the solution for ways in which weak parties are unequal to our moment of strong partisanship it seems unlikely to us that the best remedy is to weaken them even further.\xa0\nTHE RULEBOOK: THE FRESHMAKER “…there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice\xa0[if the Supreme Court had been made subordinate to the legislative branch].”\xa0–\xa0Alexander Hamilton,\xa0Federalist No. 81  TIME OUT: OLD HICKORY DIDN’T MISS Tennessee State Museum:\xa0“In the spring of 1806,\xa0Andrew Jackson\xa0and\xa0Charles Dickinson\xa0had a series of disagreements.\xa0… One argument concerned a horse race scheduled between Jackson’s horse\xa0Truxton\xa0and a horse owned by [Dickinson’s father in law]. …Dickinson publicly said insulting things about Jackson’s wife\xa0Rachel.\xa0… \xa0Finally Dickinson wrote a statement that was published in a Nashville newspaper calling Jackson a coward… Jackson wrote a letter challenging Dickinson to a duel.\xa0… [On this date 212 years ago] the two men and their seconds met in Kentucky for the duel (Dueling was outlawed in Tennessee).\xa0… Dickinson shot first, hitting Jackson in the chest.\xa0However, Jackson wore a coat that was too big for him.\xa0This may have upset Dickinson’s aim and the bullet missed Jackson’s heart.\xa0Then, though in great pain, Jackson carefully aimed and fired at Dickinson.\xa0The bullet hit Dickinson in the abdomen, and he eventually died from blood loss.\xa0… Jackson was highly criticized for dueling and\xa0for killing Dickinson.\xa0However he never apologized for the act.”  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.

This compares to the results of an April 18 survey by the independent Quinnipiac University, showing the race too close to call with Sen. Cruz at 47 percent and O\'Rourke at 44 percent. Today, Cruz leads 57 - 35 percent among men, up from 51 - 40 percent April 18. Women go 44 percent for Cruz and 42 percent for O\'Rourke, compared to last month when women went 47 percent for O\'Rourke and 43 percent for Cruz. … Independent voters are divided with 43 percent for O\'Rourke and 41 percent for Cruz. Texas voters approve 52 - 39 percent of the job Cruz is doing and give him a 49 - 38 percent favorability rating. O\'Rourke gets a 30 - 19 percent favorability rating, while 50 percent of voters don\'t know enough about him to form an opinion of him.”  GOP bears down on immigration ads while Dems prefer health care -\xa0USA Today: “House Republican candidates are blanketing the airwaves with TV ads embracing a hard line on immigration — a dramatic shift from the midterm elections in 2014, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Kantar Media. Republicans have aired more than 14,000 campaign ads touting a tough Trump-style immigration platform this year. The barrage underscores why House GOP leaders worry that passing a legislative fix for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, referred to as DREAMers, would put GOP candidates at risk heading into the fall election. … Democrats bombard voters with ads that promise to protect Obamacare, shore up Social Security and expand Medicare, according to the data from Kantar’s Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG).”  Trump focuses outreach on big donors -\xa0Politico: “President Donald Trump is plunging into the big-donor game, planning an appearance at a six-figure-a-head fundraiser benefiting his allied super PAC. Trump is expected to address America First Action’s leadership summit, according to the super PAC’s president, Brian Walsh. The president is slated to speak on the second night of the two-day conference, to be held June 18-19 at Trump International Hotel in Washington. Getting in won’t come cheap. Donors will need to pony up at least $100,000 to attend; VIP status will be at least $250,000. While the president has lent his support to the group and appeared at benefit dinners for America First Action’s backers, he has yet to appear at a fundraiser for it. Under federal law, Trump can only ask for donations of up to $5,000 for any super PAC, though he can appear at the event. The super PAC will begin sending out invitations to major GOP donors on Wednesday.”  Phoenix mayor resigns to run for Congress -\xa0Fox News: “Phoenix Mayor\xa0Greg Stanton, an anti-Trump Democrat who has held the post in Arizona\'s capital city for more than six years, stepped down Tuesday to focus on a run for Congress. Stanton first announced in October that he intended to run for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by departing Democratic Rep.\xa0Kyrsten Sinema, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Republican\xa0Jeff Flake. Under Arizona\'s ‘resign to run’ law, Stanton had to resign from the mayorship by the end of May in order to maintain his federal candidacy. Wednesday is the filing deadline for the race in Arizona\'s 9th Congressional District, which is centered in Tempe and includes parts of nearby communities, including Phoenix. The primaries are scheduled for Aug. 28, and the general election will be Nov. 6. Stanton is expected to face at least two other Democrats, while as many as five Republicans are expected to run. Independent candidates and those representing smaller parties also will run.”  TRUMP KEEPS UP SPY CLAIMS DESPITE GOWDY ASSURANCES The Hill:\xa0“President Trump’s mind hasn’t been changed by a top Republican’s assessment the FBI acted appropriately\xa0in using a confidential source in the Russia probe, the White House said\xa0Wednesday.\xa0‘Clearly, there’s still cause for concern that still needs to be looked at,’ White House press secretary\xa0Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.\xa0Sanders was responding to Rep.\xa0Trey Gowdy’s (R-S.C.) comments that ‘the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do’ by having a confidential source speak with Trump campaign associates who were suspected of having contacts with Russians during the 2016 election.\xa0\xa0His statements rebutted the president’s unsubstantiated claim that the Obama administration embedded a spy in the Trump campaign in order to boost Democrats.”  Trump pushed Sessions to reverse recusal -\xa0NYT:\xa0“[President Trump’s] grievance was with Mr. Sessions: The president objected to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump, who had told aides that he needed a loyalist overseeing the inquiry, berated Mr. Sessions and told him he should reverse his decision, an unusual and potentially inappropriate request. Mr. Sessions refused. The confrontation, which has not been previously reported, is being investigated by the special counsel,\xa0Robert S. Mueller III,\xa0as are the president’s public and private attacks on Mr. Sessions and efforts to get him to resign. Mr. Trump dwelled on the recusal for months, according to confidants and current and former administration officials who described his behavior toward the attorney general. The special counsel’s interest demonstrates Mr. Sessions’s overlooked role as a key witness in the investigation into whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the inquiry itself. It also suggests that the obstruction investigation is broader than it is widely understood to be…”  PLAY-BY-PLAY Trump said to have bragged to donors about secret strikes in Syria\xa0-\xa0Politico  McCarthy polishes conservative bona fides with budget clawback bid\xa0-\xa0The Hill  ‘The polls are all right’\xa0-\xa0FiveThirtyEight  President’s daughter bows out on press call after questions about her business deals\xa0-\xa0CBS News  President’s son-in-law gets star turn with White House guest Kim Kardashian -\xa0Vanity Fair  Bitcoin boosting House candidate takes heat on campaign finance rules\xa0-\xa0Politico  AUDIBLE: MR. BASEBALL\xa0 “You woulda been thrown out at first if I was playing, buddy.” –\xa0A friendly taunt from Rep.\xa0Steve Scalise\xa0to Rep.\xa0Trent Kelly\xa0as Scalise attended his first practice with the GOP’s congressional baseball team since the one where he was nearly killed by a gunman last year. It’s part of an engrossing profile\xa0on Scalise and the race for House speaker.  FROM THE BLEACHERS “I\'ve done stand-up comedy myself.\xa0 I once made a joke about my mother that she found so offensive she didn\'t speak to me for a week.\xa0 If anyone knows about crossing lines in the pursuit of a joke, it would be me. But there\'s a HUGE difference between the lazy, all-encompassing bin of ‘political correctness’ and lines which should not be crossed.\xa0 Making a joke about a long-maligned ethnic group at a time of increasing racial polarization would seem to be one of those common-sense times, and having a bipolar mental illness is not a sufficient excuse. ABC is in the business of risk.\xa0 They cut her loose because her show was too risky based on their business model.\xa0 I liked her reboot, and I missed the Connors.\xa0 But if you think they caved merely due to ‘political correctness,’ then you have truly jumped the shark. That\'s too bad.” –\xa0Patrick S. Duffy, Los Angeles  [Ed. note: Oh dear, Mr. Duffy! I’m afraid I didn’t make myself clear enough here. The “new political correctness” we were talking about on Tuesday wasn’t the decision to scrap\xa0Roseanne Barr’s television show. The new political correctness we were discussing was the one in which people would defend a bigot or even change their taste in art for the sake of political tribalism. Conservatives complained for decades about P.C. and the enforcement of speech codes, etc. They had a point since we ought not be policing the free exchange of ideas or banning speech just to protect people’s feelings. But there is an increasingly strong impulse on the populist right these days to submit to the blunt judgement of the tribe when it comes to these matters. I hope most Americans will decline to engage passionately on the subject of what one television network did with one show, but many will simply on the grounds of tribal grievance. I have already seen plenty of “I’m not defending her, but….” Egads. How much proof does Barr have to provide that she’s far beyond the bounds of decency before people shun her? The new political correctness is different in many ways, but like the old, demands that you substitute the judgement of others for your own.]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0  “Chris: Your Monday assessment of the ‘new political correctness’ in the light of Roseanne\'s latest outrageousness is razor sharp and diamond clear.\xa0 I was cheering to myself at several points in the analysis. ‘If you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there’s not much we can tell you...’ Amen.” –\xa0Jack Lavelle, Phoenix  [Ed. note: We quote\xa0George Orwell\xa0here quite often and I think the occasion demands it again: “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.” Thinking for oneself is HARD. Surrendering your will to the demands of the mob is easy. And now that mobs are easy to form and work in the close quarters of social media it’s getting harder to retain your own judgement, ethics and worldview. But it is certainly worth the fight!]\xa0  “Stick shifts, be they three on a tree or four on the floor should stay, at least until ‘they’ can figure out how to automate a gas fill. Every day, millions fill their tanks the same way their grands and greats did over a century ago! Now that is something to complain about. It’s fun to drive with a clutch (look it up). Puttin’ on gas? Not so much.” –\xa0Bob Wood, Bismarck, N.D.

LA, LA, LA, DI, DE, DA\xa0 NY Post:\xa0“Sing us a song, Long Island Rail Road riders! In a very un-New York like show of unity on a commuter train, an entire LIRR car busted out singing ‘Piano Man,’ video posted to Twitter shows. The 10-second clip shows nearly everyone on the car singing in unison while smiling and swaying. The song is written by Long Island native son\xa0Billy Joel, who is also known for ‘New York State of Mind.’ Pro-tennis playerJules Elbaba\xa0said she was riding on the Huntington-bound train at about ‘9 o’clock on a Saturday’ when she struck up a conversation with a guy in a Billy Joel tribute band. She asked him to sing a few bars and then joined in. Seconds later, the whole car was belting it out. ‘Before I knew it, the whole car was singing,’ said the 23-year-old from Oyster Bay. Elbaba posted the video on Twitter with an uplifting caption, wishing that LIRR riders could always get along so well.”  Chris Stirewalt\xa0is the politics editor for Fox News.\xa0Brianna McClelland\xa0contributed to this report.

Phil Bredesen, a Democrat in the running to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker, as an “absolute total tool of Chuck Schumer and, of course, the MS-13 lover Nancy Pelosi.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, who defended labeling members of the MS-13 gang as “animals,” hit the House minority leader for taking exception with the classification. “We are all God’s children,” Pelosi argued in response last week.\nThe president’s fiery comments, in front of a large crowd Tuesday at the Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, were made to boost GOP Senate hopeful Marsha Blackburn.\n\nTrump did not mention the earlier cancellation of Roseanne Barr\'s television show.\xa0\nBlackburn, a Republican congresswoman, is vying for her party’s nomination to replace retiring Corker, a Republican. Blackburn and Bredesen are expected to face off in a general election that is considered a toss-up by Fox News.\n“They’re more interested in taking care of criminals than they are in taking care of you,” Trump said of Democrats as the crowd booed. The president said Bredesen, whom he claimed he had never even heard of, “donated a lot of money to the campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.”\n\n\n\n"Democrats have opposed every common sense measure to stop this horrendous scurge of crime, to dismantle MS-13 and to end illegal immigration," he continued.\n“You have to get out,” to vote, Trump said. “We need Marsha Blackburn to win. And it’s going to be a very special time. Together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power back to our great American patriots.”\n"Tennessee needs a senator that’s going to support President Donald Trump and I am going to be there to stand with President Trump to take your Tennessee values to Washington, D.C. to fight with him to get the job done," Blackburn said.\xa0\nThe campaign in Tennessee is among several races crucial to Trump’s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans have a two-seat majority.\nTrump won Tennessee with more than 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 presidential election.\n“This November, this is the state were America’s comeback will continue full speed ahead,” the president said.\nPrimaries are scheduled for Aug. 2.\nEarlier in the evening Trump resurrected talk of the construction of a southern border wall, reiterating a campaign promise that Mexico would pay for it.\n"I don\'t want to cause a problem but in the end Mexico is going to pay for the wall," the president said to cheers. "I\'m just telling you Mexico is paying for the wall. They make all of this money and they do nothing to stop people coming through Mexico from Honduras and all these countries. They do nothing. They are going to pay for the wall and they are going to enjoy it, okay?"\nThat claim was met with a swift tweet from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.\n"President @realDonaldTrump: NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall," he wrote. "Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us)."\n\nPresident @realDonaldTrump: NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us).— Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) May 30, 2018\n\n\nAlso at the rally, Trump spoke of pending new health care legislation. Speaking of his "two Alexes" - Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar - Trump said "phenomenal" health care plans would be released in the upcoming weeks.\nHe did not discuss any additional details on the plan.\nFox News’ Kaitlyn Schallhorn, Adam Shaw and Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.\n\nMatt Richardson is an editor for Fox News.

Trump, in announcing the pardon, said he was "treated very unfairly by our government."\n\nWill be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\nThe pardoning of\xa0D\'Souza is Trump\'s fifth since taking office in 2017.\n\nRead on for a look at what presidential pardons are, and why the president has the authority to issue them.\nWhat is a presidential pardon?\nA pardon is seen as a “sign of forgiveness,” not necessarily evidence that a person is innocent, according to the Department of Justice.\n\n\n\n“A presidential pardon is ordinarily a sign of forgiveness and is granted in recognition of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or release from confinement,” the Justice Department states. “A pardon is not a sign of vindication and does not connote or establish innocence.”\n“For that reason, when considering the merits of a pardon petition, pardon officials take into account the petitioner’s acceptance of responsibility, remorse and atonement for the offense.”\nIf pardoned, people must still disclose the past conviction when required but can also disclose a pardon has been granted. A pardon will restore some of a person’s rights, but not those that are dictated by the state, such as the ability to hold public office or vote.\nWho grants the president the authority?\nThe president “shall have the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment,” according to Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.\nThis power – which only the president has – applies to federal crimes, not state offenses, according to the Justice Department. The pardoning power does cover Washington, D.C., and military court-martial proceedings.\nHow does one receive a pardon?\nTo apply for a pardon, a person must submit a petition to the Office of the Pardon Attorney, a part of the Justice Department.\nAdditionally, a five-year waiting period must occur before a person is eligible to be pardoned.\nThose seeking a pardon for a military offense must apply through the secretary of the military department that had jurisdiction over the case, according to the Justice Department.\nIf a pardon petition is denied, the Justice Department allows a new petition to be filed two years later.\nAre they common?\nThey certainly aren’t unusual. Former President Barack Obama noticeably granted many during his two terms in office.\nAccording to data from the Pew Research Center, Obama granted clemency to more people – 1,927 people, to be exact – than any president since Harry S. Truman.\nIn comparison, former President George W. Bush granted 200 people total clemency, and former President Bill Clinton did so for 459 people. Truman granted clemency to 2,044 people, and former President Franklin D. Roosevelt to 3,796.\nObama also received more requests than any other president.\nTrump has so far pardoned five people: former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, former Vice President Dick Cheney chief of staff Scooter Libby,\xa0the late boxer Jack Johnson\xa0and now\xa0conservative commentator\xa0Dinesh D\'Souza.\xa0\nJohnson\'s pardon was given posthumously.\xa0\nHe commuted the sentence of\xa0meat plant executive\xa0Sholom Rubashkin.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a rumored 2020 candidate for the Democratic Party\'s presidential nomination, speaks in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., Aug. 22, 2017.\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(Associated Press)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., remained mute about her 2020 ambitions Thursday during a town hall meeting in her home state, but attacked the Trump administration’s immigration policies as “immoral” and said she supports a ban on “weapons of war.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This administration, as far as I’m concerned, has put a target on California’s back and we’re going to need to fight this,” Harris told a crowd of more than 1,000 people in the San Fernando Valley, many of whom were young students, the Los Angeles Daily News reported.\n\n“This administration, as far as I’m concerned, has put a target on California’s back and we’re going to need to fight this.”\n- U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.\n\nShe criticized the administration\'s zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration, which has led to at least 1,300 children being separated from parents who attempted to cross the border illegally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s immoral,” she said. “And let’s be clear, government should be in the business of keeping families together, not tearing them apart.”\nHarris received praise from progressives after her heated confrontation with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last month, in which she took the Trump administration official to task over the issue.\nBut Nielsen denied the administration is intentionally splitting the families, explaining to Harris that parents who attempted to enter the country illegally may lose their children if they face charges or jail time, as according to the existing U.S. laws that precede the election of Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, California\'s junior U.S. senator, isn’t facing re-election this year, but her town hall was held just days before Tuesday’s primary election in the state -- which Democrats hope will help solidify their domination in California and eventually flip seats in the U.S. Congress.\nBut holding a town hall while not facing an election merely fueled speculation that Harris may run for president in 2020. Rather than dismiss the rumors about it, Harris told reporters that she had “no announcements to make.”\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nKamala Harris Hits White House as Less Illegal Immigrants Seek College Aid\n\n\nDuring the event, Harris outlined some of her policy wishes, including banning “weapons of war” and introducing mandatory background checks.\n“It’s a false choice to suggest you either support the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away,” she told the audience. “That is ridiculous.”\n\n“It’s a false choice to suggest you either support the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away. That is ridiculous.”\n- U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.\n\nShe also spoke about a bipartisan bill she’s working on with U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would reform the court’s bail system.\nHarris wrapped up her appearance by saying that although Trump poses challenges to people, she doesn’t believe the country is divided.\n“I reject that premise. I do not believe we are divided. I believe that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, and I know that to be true,” she said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Eric Greitens faced a felony charge of invasion-of-privacy, accused of taking and transmitting a non-consensual photo of a woman he was having an affair with. In a report, the woman testified that Greitens was violent and sexually assaulted her.\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nGov. Eric Greitens\xa0said he will resign this week following a report that an affair he had was at times violent and non-consensual and allegations of misuse of a charity donor list.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"The time has come, though, to tend to those who have been wounded and to care for those who need us most," Greitens, a Republican, said on May 29. "So for the moment, let us walk off the battlefield with our heads held high."\xa0\nGreitens\' last day in office will be June 1. His resignation allows him to avoid the potentially dubious distinction of becoming the first Missouri governor ever impeached.\xa0\n\nEarlier in May, prosecutors dropped the felony invasion-of-privacy charges against Greitens but said they planned to re-file the case. After he resigned, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said her office is dropping another charge of computer data tampering, related to allegations that he misused a charity donor list.\xa0\nMissouri lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had been asking Greitens to step down ever since the sexual misconduct scandal surfaced. He\'s been accused of taking and transmitting a non-consensual -- partially nude -- photo of a woman with whom he was having the affair.\nHere’s a look at the allegations and what the Republican governor has said about it.\n\n\n\nWhy was Greitens on trial?\n\n\n\n\n\nGov. Eric Greitens was indicted and booked in February 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(St. Louis Metropolitan Police Dept.)\n\n\n\nGreitens was indicted\xa0in February on a felony invasion-of-privacy charge. He was booked at the St. Louis Justice Center before he was released on his own recognizance, according to a circuit attorney spokeswoman.\nThe charges came after a man secretly recorded his wife admitting to having an extramarital affair with Greitens in March 2015. In the recording, she alleged that Greitens took a photo of her when she was partially nude without her permission and threatened to release photos of her if she told anyone about the affair, KMOV-TV reported.\nThe couple, not publicly identified, have since divorced.\nGreitens admitted to the affair in February in a joint statement with his wife, Sheena. He said he\'d made a “deeply personal mistake” before he was elected, and that the family had “dealt with this together honestly and privately.”\nHowever, his attorney told KMOV-TV that “there was no blackmail.”\nIn a Facebook post, Greitens slammed the “reckless liberal prosecutor who uses her office to score political points.” He said that while he\'d “made a personal mistake” before becoming governor, he “did not commit a crime.”\n\n\n\nIf convicted, Greitens could have face up to four years in prison. He has declined to directly answer questions about whether he took the photo.\nWhat was in the accuser’s testimony?\nWARNING: GRAPHIC DETAILS BELOW\nA Missouri House investigative committee was assembled shortly after Greitens was indicted on the felony charge.\nAfter speaking to the accuser and other witnesses, it released a report – signed by five Republicans and two Democrats – that included a sensitive-content warning. The lawmakers said they found the woman to be an “overall credible witness.”\nThe meeting\nThe woman said she met Greitens in 2013 when he became a client at the hair salon where she worked, according to the report. She said that she developed a “crush” on Greitens, but when she saw him in the salon in March 2015, he “moved his hand up her leg ‘all the way up to [her] crotch’ without her consent."\n‘Sexy workout’\nLater that month, she said Greitens asked her to come to his house when his wife was out of town. She said he did not want to be seen in public with her because he was running for office.\nAt his house, she testified that Greitens told her he thought she hadn’t “been treated good in so long” and wanted her to exercise. She said “for whatever reason, I trusted him.”\nGreitens then gave her men’s pajama pants and a man’s white T-shirt with a slit at the top and instructed her to change into them, she said. After she changed, she claimed he told her he was going to teach her “how to do a proper pull-up.”\xa0 She said she thought “this is going to be some sort of sexy workout.”\n“I still really thought he was perfect,” the woman testified, adding that Greitens knew she had not cheated on her husband in the past, and she didn’t want to “do anything physical” with him. “So I think I was just confused, kind of shocked. And I was curious enough – he likes me this much that he has something planned for our workout?”\nThe photo\nWhen the two got to the basement, the woman alleged, Greitens taped her hands to the pull-up rings and blindfolded her. She said the items he used were already on a workout bench nearby.\nHe then spit water into her mouth, telling her she needed to be hydrated, she testified. She said it was his way of trying to kiss her, but she did not want to be kissed.\nGreitens began to kiss her, and he tore off the white shirt, she testified. During this time, he was also “pull[ing] down [her] pants,” but she did not give consent, she said.\n“[T]hen I hear him kind of, like, step back – take a step back and I hear – I can hear like a, like a cell phone – like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold,” she added.\nGreitens said: “You’re not going to mention my name. Don’t even mention my name to anybody at all, because if you do, I’m going to take these pictures, and I’m going to put them everywhere I can. They are going to be everywhere, and then everyone will know what a little whore you are,” she testified.\nShe alleged he spanked her after she didn’t respond.\n“I was definitely fearful. I was so embarrassed and ashamed, because I really felt like a whore because I had let him get me in this position before we’ve even kissed. I felt really used,” she said.\nA photo has not been obtained by lawmakers on the committee nor by the prosecutor in the criminal case.\nThe aftermath\nAs she was trying to leave, Greitens gave her a hug and laid her on the floor while she wept, the woman testified. On the floor, the woman testified, she performed oral sex on Greitens because she “felt that she had no other choice if she were going to get out of the basement,” according to the report.\nShe said Greitens didn’t prevent her from leaving after that, but she forgot her keys at the house. When she went back to get them, she said she confronted Greitens about the picture.\n“You have to understand, I’m running for office, and people will get me and I have to have some sort of thing to protect myself,” she claimed he told her.\nThe woman testified that Greitens told her he had deleted the photo, but that she didn’t believe him. \xa0\nHow has Greitens responded?\nGreitens has called the accusations a “political witch hunt.”\nHe did not testify before the House committee and said the report was “one-sided tabloid, trash gossip that was produced in a secret room.”\nHe also highlighted a comment the woman made during a deposition in his criminal case in which she was asked if she saw what she believed to be a phone used to take the photo. A court filing from Greitens’ attorneys quoted her as saying, “I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened.”\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Sheena claimed in a letter to the Missouri lawmakers investigating the allegations that she was stalked by the accuser’s ex-husband, The Washington Examiner reported.\n“When I didn’t respond to his anonymous emails, he sent me a letter,” Sheena said. “When a letter to me didn’t produce the desired response, he contacted my parents. When letters didn’t satisfy him, he made his accusations public on Twitter. And finally, when targeting our family on social media didn’t fulfill his agenda, he secretly recorded his wife admitting to the affair and began shopping the audio tape to news outlets.”\nHow have lawmakers responded?\nHouse Speaker Todd Richardson called the woman\'s testimony “beyond disturbing” and defended the integrity of the investigation. He said, “Let me be very clear about this: This is not a witch hunt, and the committee had no political agenda.”\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on Greitens to resign. They include the state’s Republican Attorney Gen. Josh Hawley, who is also a U.S. Senate candidate.\n“The conduct the report details is certainly impeachable, in my judgment, and the House is well within its rights to proceed on that front,” Hawley said in a statement. “But the people of Missouri should not be put through that ordeal. Governor Greitens should resign immediately.”\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said she read the House investigators report and believes it “is clearly time to put the interests of the people of Missouri first” in calling for Greitens to resign.\n\nI have read the official report from the Republican led Missouri House investigation, including the sworn testimony. It is clearly time to put the interests of the people of Missouri first. The Governor should resign.— Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) April 12, 2018\n\n\n“This is a sad chapter in our history that should never have come to pass,” Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican, said on social media. “The transcripts paint the picture of a vulnerable woman and a man who preyed on that vulnerability. I am disgusted, disheartened and I believe Governor Greitens is unfit to lead our state.”\n\nThis is a sad chapter in our history that should never have come to pass. Two months ago, after the disturbing allegations against the Governor came to light, I called for an immediate and transparent investigation.— Ann Wagner (@RepAnnWagner) April 12, 2018\n\n\nState Rep. Jean Evans also called on Greitens to resign, saying, “Violence against women is always wrong.”\n\nViolence against women is always wrong. Dishonesty and betrayal are always wrong. I am deeply disturbed by the revelations today and urge Gov Eric Greitens to do what is in the best interest of the people of Missouri and resign.— Jean Evans ⚜️ (@MoRepEvans) April 11, 2018\n\n\nState Senate Majority Leader Mike Kehoe is the highest-ranking member of the legislature to call on Greitens to resign. He said the governor has lost the "moral authority and the ability to lead," KMBC-TV reported.\xa0\xa0\nWhat is Greitens’ background?\nA onetime Navy SEAL, Greitens assumed office in January 2017. He beat Democrat and former Attorney General Chris Koster.\nHawley is also investigating The Mission Continues, a veterans charity founded by Greitens, as it relates to the state\'s consumer protection and charitable registration and reporting laws. That probe came after media reports alleged Greitens\' campaign had obtained and used a charity donor list in 2015 as it ramped up fundraising for his gubernatorial bid.\nGreitens married Sheena in August 2011, and the pair have two children. He was married once before, but it ended in divorce in 2003, according to The Kansas City Star.\nFox News’ Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

And besides, he doesn’t need much of an excuse to whack the press (or engage in counterpunching, as he likes to view it).\n\nSo here’s a snapshot, starting with the first of several Trump tweets from yesterday:\n“Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!”\nThe context: The president was reacting to a New York Times story about a confidential memo by fired FBI deputy Andrew McCabe, saying Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein had told him that Trump asked him to mention Russia in his letter urging that Comey be canned.\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nThe scorecard: Russia was a factor, by the president’s own account.\nTrump told NBC’s Lester Holt soon after the firing that he was going to dump Comey “regardless of recommendation” by Rosenstein. “And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it\'s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.”\nThe tweet: “The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?”\nThe context: There’s a semantic debate in the press over whether the FBI’s informant in 2016, an American professor in London, was a spy infiltrating the Trump camp or just doing his job against possible Russian intelligence-gathering.\nThe scorecard: The existence of the FBI informant who spoke to three Trump campaign advisers was revealed by the “failing New York Times,” and sparked endless stories and segments. So it’s not true that the media aren’t mentioning it—they just aren’t doing it in the “Spygate” terms that the president would prefer.\nThe tweet: “Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!”\nThe context: This is a continuation of Trump’s criticism of Disney CEO Bob Iger after he personally apologized to Valerie Jarrett for the racist Roseanne tweet and canceled her hit sitcom. ABC’s Brian Ross reported in December that Trump had told his adviser Michael Flynn to make contact with Russian officials during the campaign, which would have fueled the collusion argument (and the stock market did drop several hundred points). The truth was the Flynn had been asked to do this after the election, when such contacts would be routine for an incoming administration.\nThe scorecard: This was a very bad mistake. But despite Trump’s assertion, ABC apologized for the story, issued a full retraction and suspended Brian Ross for a month without pay. What’s more, Ross was transferred to a lower-profile job where he doesn’t deal with White House politics.\nThe tweet: “The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at ‘1000 people,’ when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don’t ‘get’ me, and never did!”\nThe context: The Times did report from a Nashville rally this week that about a thousand folks had shown up. Trump often accuses the media of underestimating his crowd size, a dispute that famously dates back to Inauguration Day.\nThe scorecard: The president is right on the facts, and the paper ran a correction.\nThe author, Julie Hirschfeld Davis, tweeted: “President @realDonaldTrump is correct about his crowd last night. My estimate was way off, and we have corrected our story to reflect the fire marshal’s estimate of 5,500 people. When we get it wrong, we say so.”\nSo: Some hits, some overstatements, some misses, another day at the virtual office in the continuing warfare with the media. And all of it is red meat for Trump’s 52 million Twitter followers.\n\xa0\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

Widow of NYPD officer speaks out.\n\n\n\n\nA cop killer recently released from prison will get another added benefit of freedom: the right to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Bell, 70, who served 44 years in prison for the murder of two New York police officers in the 1970s, was granted parole last month by the state parole board. But a fresh decision by New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo\xa0to issue conditional pardons to more than 24,000 parolees means Bell can vote in the upcoming election.\xa0\n“How could he do something like that? This is a convicted felon. He killed police officers in New York,” Dianne Piagentini, the widow of one of the murdered officers, said on “Fox & Friends” Friday, noting Bell was “tried and convicted” and given “25 years to life” in prison.\n\nCuomo’s pardons, issued earlier this week, cover 24,086 ex-cons who are under parole supervision, including Bell. The move follows a related executive order signed by the governor last month.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Bell, now 70 years old, was granted parole after serving 44 years in prison for the murder of two New York Police officers in 1971. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nIn 1971, Bell, a convicted ex-gang member, murdered New York police officers Joseph Piagentini and his partner, Waverly Jones. The New York State Parole Board voted to give Bell parole in April.\nCuomo has criticized the parole board’s decision, but said the panel is not subject to his control.\n\n\n\n“If I were on the parole board, I would not have made that decision,” Cuomo told reporters last month. “The parole board is an independent board but I would not have made that decision.”\nDespite Cuomo’s opposition to Bell’s release and parole, the governor’s new policy makes Bell eligible to participate at the polls during the 2018 New York primaries and general election.\n“The right to vote is fundamental and it is unconscionable to deny that basic right of citizenship to New Yorkers who have paid their debt to society,” Cuomo said. “Restoring a voice to men and women reentering their communities will strengthen our democracy, as well as the reentry process, which in turn will help reduce recidivism.”\nDianne Piagentini, in the interview with Fox News, stressed that Bell was “tried and convicted” and given “25 years to life” in prison.\n“He’s doing it for votes,” Piagentini said. “He did it right before the Democratic convention.”\nCuomo’s announcement came in the run-up to the New York Democratic Convention. Cuomo is seeking a third term as governor of New York, campaigning against former “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon in the gubernatorial primary.\nCuomo has also faced criticism from the Republican candidate for governor, Marcus Molinaro.\n“While I unequivocally believe in second chances, I also believe in the rule of law,” Molinaro said when Cuomo signed the executive order. “Desperate to ward off a challenge from Cynthia Nixon, Andrew Cuomo’s unilateral action is an insult to the legislature, the courts, crime victims and the voters of the State of New York.”\nMolinaro added this week that Bell “belongs in a maximum security prison cell for life, not in a voting booth.”\nA spokesperson for Cuomo\'s office and his campaign did not respond to Fox News\' request for comment.\xa0\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Slabinski and his team were rescued and taken to a safe location nearby.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened next – as Slabinski decided to mount another operation to rescue fellow SEAL Roberts – remains a matter of dispute. In the end, a member of the rescue team died, along with Roberts and five more members of another quick reaction force sent in to help.\nSlabinski said that after initially hearing Roberts had survived the fall and was fighting alone, he ordered his team back up the mountain to rescue him. Slabinski knew the odds were against him but attempted to return to the same spot to face a larger enemy force armed with heavy weapons.\xa0\n“My teammate’s alive. I know that he is in enemy territory,” he said.\nSlabinski said a drone feed showed Roberts detained and being led away by Al Qaeda fighters.\nKnowing the enemy he faced and the chances of survival for him and his team slim, Slabinski, a second-generation SEAL, recalled his Boy Scout training from his home in Northampton, Mass.\n“It\'s the Boy Scout oath: ‘It\'s on my honor to do my best, it\'s on my honor to do my best,’” he said.\xa0\nFlying back to the mountain, Slabinski also thought of his then-6-year-old son.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump presented Slabinski with the Medal of Honor for his actions – getting wounded team members off the mountain and directing devastating close-air-support against the enemy. But the decision to honor him has come with controversy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n“I am thinking, sorry for what\'s about to come. I love you and be great. And that\'s the last I thought of it, I parked it away in my mind, and I put my thoughts back on task,” Slabinski said.\nThinking about the ride back to the mountain, Slabinski recalled: “I\'m certain at this point also that this is a one-way trip.”\nFlying the Chinook was a legendary Army helicopter pilot from the famed 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the “Night Stalkers.” Chief Warrant Officer Alan Mack, whose helicopter was shot up on the previous attempt to land, volunteered to fly the team back into harm\'s way.\nAnother member of the team riding back into battle was Air Force Technical Sgt. John Chapman, whose job was to call in airstrikes.\nSlabinski said Chapman was hit almost immediately by machine-gun fire after stepping off the helicopter.\n“I can hear the snaps of bullets all around us, the snow kicking up, bullets hitting around us, so I know that there\'s quite a few enemy fighters out there," he said.\nHis SEALs were never able to advance after returning to the mountain. Slabinski said he tried to suppress the machine gun by tossing a grenade at the bunker. After the first one missed, Slabinski moved closer while his SEALs laid down covering fire to toss a second grenade.\nBut Slabinski’s SEAL team continued to take punishing fire from the Al Qaeda fighters.\n“When I look out at my team, I just get this feeling that they\'re just being torn apart,” Slabinski said.\nIt was at this point, Slabinski ordered his team to fall back off the side of the mountain after another member of his team went down, shot in the leg. “We’re down to three of us now, very low on ammunition,” Slabinski recalled.\nAt this point, he said he couldn’t see Roberts at all. Chapman, he said, was “no more than 10-15 feet away from me during this whole time.”\nHowever, he said, “He didn\'t move throughout this whole time. I crawled over to John, rolled over the top of John looking for some sign of life, but I didn\'t get any. No movement. No sound or anything from him.”\nThe hasty retreat meant Chapman\'s body remained where he was shot by enemy fighters.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski, now retired, has been accused of leaving Air Force Technical Sgt. John Chapman behind on a mission. Special operations forces who have seen the video tell Fox News they now believe Chapman fought on after the SEAL team retreated. Chapman has also been approved for the Medal of Honor, but the White House has not yet made the announcement, according to officials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\nBut over a decade later, drone footage obtained by the New York Times enhanced by new technology became available that appears to show a lone fighter still battling on the top of Takr Ghar. Special operations forces who have seen the video tell Fox News they now believe Chapman fought on after the SEAL team retreated.\nWhen asked to respond to criticism that he left Chapman behind, Slabinski denied the accusations.\n“I can tell you, we left no one behind. No one. What I saw, what I experienced, I know that clearly that we didn\'t leave anyone behind up there. I wasn\'t more than 20 to 30 feet away from where John was and that was my experience. But what I want people to focus on is that it\'s called Roberts Ridge now because we lost six other people up there. A total of seven,” Slabinski said.\nAsked if he thought Chapman survived after his team left the mountain, Slabinski replied: “That wasn\'t what I experienced. It wasn\'t what I saw.”\nA vivid account of the battle was first reported by Sean Naylor in Newsweek.\nChapman has also been approved for the Medal of Honor, but the White House has not yet made the announcement, according to officials.\nBack on the mountain, the battle continued.\nAfter pulling his team back from beyond enemy gun fire, Slabinski heard the rotor blades of a quick reaction force coming in to rescue his team, the same spot where two helicopters had already been shot.\n“I can\'t get on my radio change frequencies quick enough to talk to them to tell them \'do not land on top before they get they themselves have another RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] hit the engine and then they crashed,” Slabinski said.\nFive Americans of the rescue team, including three Army Rangers, were killed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSix members died during a rescue mission to save Petty Officer 1st Class Neil Roberts, who also died. Slabinski said that after initially hearing Roberts had survived the fall and was fighting alone, he ordered his team back up the mountain to rescue him. Slabinski knew the odds were against him but attempted to return to the same spot to face a larger enemy force armed with heavy weapons.  “My teammate’s alive. I know that he is in enemy territory,” he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\nAsked why he couldn’t warn the approaching helicopter fast enough, Slabinski said, “Our radios have a limited range on how far I can transmit.”\nSlabinski said he had his radio on a different frequency talking to an\xa0 Air Force AC-130 gunship orbiting overhead and delivering close-air-support to his team after Chapman went down.\n“By the time I got to the right frequency they had already gotten shot down,” Slabinski said.\nAsked if Chapman also deserved the Medal of Honor, Slabinski answered, “I think everyone that followed me up there that day is no less deserving of the award.”\nPentagon officials tell Fox the Navy put Slabinski\'s Medal of\xa0Honor recommendation forward after hearing the Air Force nominated\xa0Chapman. The officer who ordered Slabinski\'s team to the top of the\xa0mountain, despite his requests to delay the mission, was Rear Adm. Tim Szymanski,\xa0currently the top SEAL officer.\nOfficials said Szymanski wanted Slabinski’s prior award of a Navy Cross upgraded to the nation’s highest award for valor.\nAdding to the controversy, an interview Slabinski recorded in 2005 in which he describes shooting the corpse of an enemy combatant.\n"Talk about funny stuff that we did. After I shot this dude in the head there was a guy that had his feet, just his feet sticking out, some little rudge or something over here.\xa0 He was dead, but I mean, you know, I got nerves, I shot him 20 times in the legs and every time you kick him or shoot him, he would kick up, and you could see his body twitching and all that. It was like a game. Good therapy," Slabinski is heard saying on the audiotape published by Matthew Cole in\xa0“The Intercept.”\nAsked to explain his comments, Slabinski replied, “If you could hear the whole clip of that you would have heard, it was an enemy combatant. He was still actively engaging our forces that were only feet away from him.”\nOthers say what they heard him describe was the equivalent of a war crime.\nSlabinski claims his words were taken out of context.\nAsked about another incident in 2007 during an operation in southern Afghanistan, where Slabinski was accused of ordering his men to bring a “head back on a platter,” Slabinski denied ever acting inappropriately. The incident was investigated by the Navy.\n“Every day for 26 years. Honor. Integrity. I did not waiver, not even for a moment,” Slabinski said.\nSlabinski said he has had to live with his decisions that day on Takur Ghar in 2002.\n“Not a day goes by that I don\'t think of everyone there not just my team. Not a day. Those seven guys that we lost, all of us lost, they\'re sons, husbands, fathers, they had dreams,” Slabinski said.\nAsked if he had any regrets from his actions that day, Slabinski replied, “I don\'t have any regrets. I would have done everything exactly the same again.”\n\nJennifer Griffin currently serves as a national security correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) and is based out of the Washington D.C. bureau.

The ruling set off a nationwide debate about campus sexual assault and whether the nation’s judicial system takes the crime seriously enough -- even before the height of the #MeToo movement.\nIn January 2015, two graduate students from Sweden caught Turner assaulting a woman who was passed out behind a dumpster. The students tackled him and held him until police arrived. Turner, who pleaded not guilty, was convicted on three charges: two counts of digitally penetrating an unconscious person and one count of assault with intent to rape, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIt was in June 2016 that Persky, 56, sentenced Turner to six months in jail and ordered him to register as a sex offender. Prosecutors\xa0wanted a six-year sentence. Turner was released from prison after serving only half of that sentence.\nJUDGE IN STANFORD RAPE CASE IS SUBJECT OF RECALL VOTE\nMichele Dauber, a Stanford University law school professor, started a\xa0campaign to recall Persky. Dauber is an outspoken on-campus activist who helped push through more stringent sexual harassment and abuse reporting and investigation policies. She is also a family friend of the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists hold signs calling for the removal of Judge Aaron Persky from the bench after his controversial sentencing in the Stanford rape case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Stephen Lam)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We feel it’s important to respond strongly with a message of accountability for elected officials like Judge Persky who do not take sex crimes and violence against women seriously,” Dauber said. “Many eyes around the country are going to be on Santa Clara County as a model for how to respond to bias against women in the legal system.”\nThe recall campaign has raised about $1.2 million -- about half as much as supporters of the judge, The Associated Press reported. If Persky is recalled, he would be the first judge to be removed from office in California in more than 80 years.\nAccording to the Mercury News, this recall effort has been the most divisive issue on the ballot, with death threats accumulating\xa0on both sides.\n\n “The problem with this recall is it will pressure judges to follow the rule of public opinion as opposed to the rule of law.”\n- Judge Aaron Persky\n\nVOTERS WILL CONSIDER RECALL OF JUDGE IN STANFORD RAPE CASE\nThe legal community has largely\xa0opposed the recall effort, including Sajid Khan, a Santa Clara County public defender. He warned against recalling Persky, telling Mercury News that doing so could open the door to a future that “will mostly harm lower-income racial minorities.”\n"It sets a bad precedent to recall a judge for issuing a lawful sentence that wasn\'t mean enough," Meaghan Ybos, executive director of People for the Enforcement of Rape Laws, a criminal justice reform advocacy\xa0group, told Fox News. "And it does nothing to improve outcomes for rape victims."\xa0\nPersky, too, told The Associated Press the recall effort is “fundamentally unfair.” He said he is fighting against the effort, instead of vacating his seat, because recalling judges over unpopular rulings threatens the integrity of the judiciary.\n“To get justice from a judge, they need someone who follows the rules. The basic rule is the rule of law,” Persky said. “The problem with this recall is it will pressure judges to follow the rule of public opinion as opposed to the rule of law.”\nTurner is expected to be back in a San Jose court later in June. He has appealed the jury conviction, saying he was not awarded a fair trial because character witnesses were not permitted to testify about his scholastic success, honesty and swimming career.\nPersky has four years left in his six-year term, the Los Angeles Times reported. Since the Turner predicament, Persky has worked as a night judge from his home, where he issues orders and warrants in domestic violence cases. He no longer hears criminal cases, according to the newspaper.\nShould he be recalled, two female lawyers -- Cindy Hendrickson and Angela Storey -- are on the ballot to replace him, according to the Palo Alto Daily Post.\xa0\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Last month, actors Robert De Niro and Alec Baldwin helped host a pricey cocktail party in Manhattan for a\xa0Democrat campaigning in what is widely viewed as a futile effort to unseat\xa0Republican incumbent Roger Wicker in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nclose\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Bourdain slams Alec Baldwin on #MeToo movement\nAnthony Bourdain opened up about the #MeToo movement and shared some advice for actor and comedian, Alec Baldwin. \n\n\n\n\nThe party, which had suggested campaign donations ranging from $1,000 to $5,400 per person, benefitted\xa0Howard Sherman,\xa0one of six Democrats facing off in the June 5 primary, his campaign confirmed to The Associated Press. Sherman is married to actress Sela Ward, who had recurring roles in shows like "House" and "CSI:NY."\nSherman may have needed the out-of-state Hollywood help: He had been his own biggest political donor so far by a dramatic margin. A finance report showed that through the end of March, he had put $500,000 into his own campaign, and had received just one donation for $1,000. The source? His own campaign manager.\nWATCH: ALEC BALDWIN TIRES OF TRUMP\n\n\n\nWicker took aim at the event in an email to supporters, calling Baldwin and De Niro "mega liberals" who don\'t respect the president. De Niro has said Trump is not welcome at his restaurants, and Baldwin has lampooned the president regularly on "Saturday Night Live."\nBut despite his opponent\'s high-profile support, Wicker, who faces one minor challenger in the GOP primary, hasn\'t seemed to have much cause for alarm. Polls show he is the overwhelming favorite in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nActor Robert DeNiro, a frequent Trump critic, has appeared on "Saturday Night Live" as Robert Mueller.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\n"Wicker will simply shrug off any Democratic challenge," Geoff Pender, the political editor of Mississippi\'s Clarion-Ledger,\xa0wrote\xa0last week.\nRemarkably, Wicker received a $5,000 contribution from Sherman last year, according to Federal Election Commission records. Sherman was registered to vote as a Republican in California until 2016.\nSherman has said he donated because Wicker was facing the prospect of a primary challenge at the time by Chris McDaniel, a tea party-backed state lawmaker who nearly unseated longtime U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran in a bitter 2014 Republican primary.\nWHAT COCHRAN\'S RESIGNATION MEANS FOR HIS SENATE SEAT\nCochran resigned from the Senate in April after serving 40 years, citing health issues, and Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed the state agriculture commissioner, Cindy Hyde-Smith, to fill the Senate seat temporarily.\nMcDaniel had qualified to challenge Wicker this year, but switched races to challenge Hyde-Smith instead this November in a special election for the final two years of Cochran’s term. \xa0There is no primary in the special election.\n\nThis morning I traveled with @realDonaldTrump on Marine One to attend the @NavalAcademy commencement ceremony. Thank you, President Trump! pic.twitter.com/hoMBJca7FY— Senator Roger Wicker (@SenatorWicker) May 25, 2018\n\n\nIn May, a\xa0U.S. Chamber of Commerce\xa0poll showed\xa0that Hyde-Smith is significantly ahead of McDaniel and Democrat Mike Espy.\xa0Hyde-Smith commanded 30 percent of likely voters\' support, with Espy at 22 percent and McDaniel at 17 percent.\nMcDaniel\'s decision to avoid a head-to-head with Wicker, which was all but assured to be yet another bruising primary battle, has contributed to an unusually quiet election season in Mississippi. McDaniel is not as well-funded as he was in 2014, the\xa0Clarion-Ledger reported, possibly leading to fewer aggressive advertisements and more positive campaign messaging overall.\nThe six Republicans and two Democrats vying for outgoing Rep. Gregg Harper\'s seat, meanwhile, are engaged in the "polite-est, least-contested contested primary in state history," Pender wrote, with nary a negative advertisement in sight.\n"I moderated what was supposed to be a \'debate\' among the GOP candidates, but they refused to debate," Pender continued. "Their policies and platforms appear to differ only in minute degrees." \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

RNC spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany debates Wendy Osefo.\n\n\n\n\nBill Clinton’s return to the spotlight was supposed to help make his new novel a best seller, but the ex-president has found interviewers in the #MeToo era unwilling to turn the page on his checkered past with women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former president is on the interview circuit in promotion of his new political thriller co-authored with James Patterson, “The President is Missing.”\xa0But in an environment where powerful figures are being held to account for their past mistreatment of women, Clinton is facing inevitable questions about the controversies that have engulfed him since the \'90s -- and before.\nClinton had a heated interview on Monday with NBC’s Craig Melvin, accusing the reporter of ignoring "gaping facts" when he brought up Monica Lewinsky. Clinton went on to downplay his own conduct, identify with the #MeToo movement and liken himself to John F. Kennedy while pushing back on the notion he should have resigned.\xa0\n\n“I like the #MeToo movement; it\'s way overdue,” Clinton said on NBC Monday. “It doesn’t mean I agree with everything. I still have some questions about some of the decisions that have been made.”\nThe #MeToo movement was kicked into high gear last year when Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was outed as a sexual predator. The scrutiny has since ensnared a host of political and entertainment figures -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- but Clinton has faced a reckoning from some in his own party. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said last year he should have resigned.\xa0\nClinton was asked directly about Gillibrand\'s resignation comment in a separate interview with "CBS Sunday Morning."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I just disagree with her,” Clinton said, claiming she’s living in a “different context.”\nIn the NBC interview, Clinton bristled when asked if he would have resigned over his affair with then-22-year-old intern Monica Lewinsky should it have taken place during the height of #MeToo.\n“I don’t think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts. If the facts were the same today, I wouldn’t [step down,]” Clinton said. “A lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work, I think partly ‘cause they are frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don’t seem to care.”\nClinton attempted to pivot to President Trump’s alleged sexual encounter with adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2006, which he said “hasn’t gotten anything like the coverage you would expect.”\nDaniels was paid $130,000 in exchange for her silence about the alleged sexual affair by Trump attorney Michael Cohen in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Trump has also been criticized for using vulgar language to describe women, as revealed in the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape released in October 2016.\xa0\nBoth issues have been widely covered.\xa0\nClinton, meanwhile, also suggested in the NBC interview that he didn\'t owe Lewinsky an apology as he\'s already apologized to the world.\xa0\nTHE LEFT TURNS ON BILL CLINTON, BIDEN OVER BEHAVIOR TOWARD WOMEN\xa0\nAt a separate appearance in Harlem on Monday evening, though, Clinton acknowledged he got “hot under the collar” during the NBC interview.\xa0\n“The truth is, the hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were asked,” Clinton said.\xa0\nClinton added, again, that he supports the #MeToo movement, saying that it was “long overdue.”\xa0\nThe book tour, meanwhile, has opened Clinton up to renewed scrutiny over other long-simmering sexual assault and harassment allegations -- which he has denied through a lawyer.\xa0\xa0\nDuring the 1990s, Clinton faced allegations of sexual misconduct by women like Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones—Hillary Clinton famously called it a “vast right-wing conspiracy.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroaddrick has alleged that Bill Clinton raped her in April 1977 and that Hillary Clinton intimidated her in an effort to keep her silent. Broaddrick gave an interview to NBC in 1999 but the network did not air her account until Clinton’s impeachment process concluded with an acquittal.\nBroaddrick tweeted following Clinton’s NBC interview, slamming both the former president and the network for ignoring her claims.\n\nThis is so disgusting.  Is there ANY reporter willing to ask Bill Clinton about RAPING me? https://t.co/K2pEpNlcFX— Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) June 4, 2018\n\n\n“This is so disgusting,” Broaddrick tweeted. “Is there ANY reporter willing to ask Bill Clinton about RAPING me?”\nShe added: “Would the NBC TODAY show like for me to come on and talk about my RAPE by Bill Clinton since they don’t have the ‘balls’ to ask him?”\n“Oh..Wait…..you are the same Network that delayed my interview until after the scumbag’s impeachment hearing was over,” she said.\nFox News’ Brian Flood contributed to this report. \n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Grimm reflects on past mistakes, plots future\nMichael Grimm was a rising star in the Republican Party before scandal struck and he served seven months in a minimum security federal prison camp\n\n\n\n\nNew York’s disgraced former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm said it’s a “no-win” situation for President Trump when endorsing congressional candidates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrimm is campaigning for his old seat in the state’s primary this month. He is competing against incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., whom the president endorsed this week.\n“Out of respect for the president, I wouldn’t advise him to get involved in House primaries because you either upset the grass-roots or the entrenched establishment, making it a no-win situation,” Grimm told Fox News, adding that it was “not a warning” to avoid involvement. \n\nTrump’s endorsement of Donovan came with a reminder for voters of Alabama’s special Senate election last year — when Roy Moore seized the Republican nomination but ultimately lost the general election to Democrat Doug Jones amid a sexual misconduct accusations.\nGrimm, a former two-term congressman, FBI agent and lawyer, fell from grace in\xa02014\xa0when he was indicted on 20 counts of tax evasion, hiring undocumented immigrants and perjury. Grimm pleaded guilty to one count of federal tax fraud — for paying undocumented workers under the table — and spent seven months of an eight-month sentence in a minimum security federal prison.\xa0\n“There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!” Trump tweeted this week.\xa0\n\nThere is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\n\nVery importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November...and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can’t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November…and his opponent will not. Remember Alabama. We can’t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat!”\xa0\nDonovan didn\'t vote with the president on tax cuts.\xa0\nGrimm is honing in on that--releasing a new television ad Friday titled: “Every time it mattered, Dan Donovan voted against President Trump.”\nDonovan, who has been in New York City politics for decades, has said that Trump endorsed him at least six times throughout his political career. He has had, though, to explain voting against Trump’s tax overhaul and plan to replace former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law — ObamaCare.\xa0\n“I vote with Trump 90 percent of the time,” Donovan said. “I vote with my constituents 100 percent of the time.”\xa0\nGrimm’s criminal history has been the central issue for the former congressman throughout the campaign.\xa0\nThe president this week pardoned conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza who pleaded guilty in 2014 for donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, allegedly going over the contribution limit by directing other donors to give to her. He was sentenced to five years of probation and eight months in a halfway house, and paid a $30,000 fine.\xa0\nD’Souza had claimed for years that he was unfairly singled out for prosecution and unfairly treated by the Obama administration.\xa0\nWhen asked if Grimm wanted a presidential pardon from Trump, he replied: “Of course!”\xa0\n“I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t, especially in my circumstances,” Grimm said, insisting that his harsh sentence was politically motivated.\xa0\nThe New York primary is set for June 26.\xa0\nFox News\' Rick Leventhal and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

One man is suing the FAA for its updated hiring practice. #Tucker\n\n\n\n\nThe safety of America\'s airline passengers is being compromised for the sake of diversity in hiring air traffic controllers, an attorney suing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told "Tucker Carlson Tonight" host Tucker Carlson on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the FAA replaced the previous hiring standards with rules designed to increase diversity among air traffic controllers, attorney Michael Pearson said.\n“A group within the FAA, including the human resources function within the FAA -- the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees -- determined that the workforce was too white,” Pearson told Carlson. “They had a concerted effort through the Department of Transportation in the Obama administration to change that.”\n\n\n"A group within the FAA ... determined that the workforce was too white. They had a concerted effort ... in the Obama administration to change that."\n- Michael Pearson, attorney suing the Federal Aviation Administration\n\nPearson said there’s no data to support that increasing diversity in the ranks of air traffic controllers would make the flying public safer. Thus, Pearson said, he is suing the FAA for its revised hiring practices.\n“It’s the safety of the national airspace that’s at risk here,” Pearson said.\nPearson, who said he was an air traffic controller in four of the nation\'s busiest facilities for nearly 27 years, asserted that much of the problem lies with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union that controls a large political action committee.\n\n\n\n"They fund a lot of politicians,” Pearson told Carlson.\n“Nothing will get passed in aviation unless they get blessing of the controller’s union,” he said, referring to legislation proposed in Congress. “Their position radically changed when the Obama administration came in.\n“This is social engineering at its finest,” he added.\nThe FAA declined to send a representative to appear on the program, Carlson said.\n\nAmy Lieu is a news editor and reporter for Fox News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who leads the joint Judiciary-Oversight review, has insisted that the investigation is an impartial probe into the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe, and not a Republican effort to bring charges against her.\nThe three hearings with the FBI personnel, scheduled for successive weeks, will be the panel’s first interviews since October.\n\nBradford Betz is an editor for Fox News.

The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of Doraville “using its law enforcement and municipal court system for revenue generation.”\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(Institute for Justice)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nHilda Brucker went down to the municipal court in October 2016 after receiving a phone call. She hadn’t received a formal summons or known of any wrongdoing; instead, she thought she needed to clear a ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when she arrived at the Doraville, Georgia, courthouse, Brucker said she was placed before a judge and prosecutor who accused her of violating city code -- because of cracks in her driveway.\nShe was fined $100 and sentenced to six months criminal probation, even though this was the first time she was made aware her driveway was considered a problem.\n\n\n\n  Eventually\n  the charges were dropped, but Brucker said Doraville “went too far” in going after her for the driveway’s appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHilda Brucker said her experience in court over cracks in her driveway was "horrifying."\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Institute for Justice)\n\n\n\n“It was just absolutely horrifying for someone like me who never even had a detention in high school,” Brucker told Fox News on Wednesday.\nBrucker is part of an Institute for Justice (IJ) lawsuit against Doraville, a town of about 10,000 people just northeast of Atlanta. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of Doraville “using its law enforcement and \n \n  municipal\n  court system for revenue generation.”\xa0\n\n\n\nThe suit takes aim at the government\'s rampant fines over seemingly minor code infractions. About 25 percent of Doraville’s operating budget is reliant on fees and fines, according to IJ, a nonprofit law firm.\xa0From August 2016 to August 2017, it raked in about $3.8 million in fines, according to IJ\'s lawsuit.\xa0\n“It’s unconstitutional because it creates a financial incentive for the city government … to ticket people,” Josh House, an IJ attorney on the case, told Fox News. He said people in the town were being “punished” for the condition of their property by having to “fund the Doraville city government.”\nThe lawsuit also contends that "prosecutors and law enforcement have a financial interest in convicting the defendant,"\xa0as they have an "incentive" to ticket and prosecute because they are paid from Doraville\'s revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Thornton was fined $1,000 and threatened with an arrest warrant because he had a "disorganized" pile of wood in his backyard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Institute for Justice)\n\n\n\nBrucker isn’t the only Doraville citizen to fall “victim” to its fees. Jeff Thornton, a neighbor, was fined $1,000 and threatened with an arrest warrant because he had a “disorganized” pile of wood in his backyard, according to IJ. Thornton told the nonprofit that he used the wood for cooking or building birdhouses.\nCITY’S ‘NITPICKY’ FINES FOR TREE STUMPS, BLINDS TRIGGER CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT\nThe fine and charges against Thornton were also eventually dropped. But, the lawsuit said,\xa0he "lives under the threat of being ticketed again by Doraville code enforcement and law enforcement and convicted by Doraville\'s municipal court personnel."\nAside from residents, drivers passing through Doraville -- many on their way to or from Atlanta -- have also faced excessive ticketing, according to IJ. Janice Craig was given a $215 ticket for holding up traffic when she attempted to switch lanes while driving through town.\nA 2014 Atlanta Journal-Constitution report called Doraville one of the "most aggressive police forces" in Georgia when it comes to traffic tickets. The newspaper reported the city collects more fines per capita than anywhere else in the metro Atlanta area.\xa0\n“Every city is unique,” Shawn Gillen, then the city manager, told the Journal-Constitution. “It’s probably very difficult to do comparisons. But we feel our level of traffic enforcement is extremely reasonable relative to the traffic counts that we have.”\nA spokesperson for Doraville did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.\n\n“Am I going to cross the border into this town and be subject to a rapacious law enforcement? Is driving through Doraville something I can afford today?”\n- Institute for Justice Attorney Josh House\n\nDoraville’s policies “place a huge burden on not only the homeowners but those who are in the area driving and have to think about, ‘Am I going to cross the border into this town and be subject to a rapacious law enforcement?’” House said. “Is driving through Doraville something I can afford today?”\nDoraville ranks sixth in the nation for the amount of revenue it brings in from fines and fees as a proportion of its total revenue, according to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\xa0That study also said, as of 2012, the median income was $43,311 and more than 30 percent of the population lived in poverty.\xa0\nBrucker, a freelance writer, said most of the citizens in the town are working-class or single women, such as herself.\nHouse said he hopes the town of Doraville will change its policy, but said a lawsuit may be necessary for that to happen.\xa0\xa0\nBIKINI BARISTAS HIT WITH COURT BRIEF DEMANDING THEY COVER UP\n“I didn’t want it to happen to me again, and I didn’t want it to happen to anyone else either,” Brucker said of the lawsuit.\nAside from her driveway, Brucker also said the prosecutor tried to nail her for some chipped paint near a water drain on her house and a small patch of what appeared to be weeds in her yard. The prosecutor brought photos of the supposed neglect to her house to the judge, but those complaints were dismissed, she said.\xa0\nIn a video for IJ, Brucker called the actions taken against her "ridiculous and ludicrous."\xa0\n"No one ever asked me to fix the driveway. This is a very old driveway," she said. "Who does that?"\nNearly two years after she was brought before a judge for the condition of her driveway, Brucker said it remains unchanged.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

The president laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, alongside Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford. He then delivered brief remarks.\n"We gather to honor the lives of America\'s greatest heroes," Trump said. “We’re joined today by the families of American heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice. We cannot imagine the depth of emotion that this day brings each year, the grief renewed, the memories relived, those last beautiful moments together cherished and always remembered. You also feel that incredible pride- a pride shared by one really and truly grateful nation."\xa0\n\n“We will never forget our heroes,” the president said, adding that “today, we pay tribute to their service” and “strive to be worthy of their sacrifice.”\n\nHappy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years), rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2018\n\n\n"It\'s our heroes who make us who we are and who determine what we will be. Our fallen heroes have not only written our history, they\'ve shaped our destiny," Trump said.\nThe president pointed to each "marker" on the gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery, saying they "teach us what it means to be loyal and faithful and proud and brave and righteous and true."\xa0\n\n\n\n"That is why we come to this most sacred place. That is why we guard these grounds with absolute devotion," Trump said. "That is why we always will remember because here on this soil, on these grounds, beneath those fields, lie the true source of American greatness, of American glory and of American freedom."\xa0\nHe added that "as long as we are blessed with patriots such as these, we shall forever remain one people, one family and one nation under God."\xa0\nAhead of the ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Trump suggested that “those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today,” touting the economy and record-low unemployment numbers.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

More recently, he said, Trump has not actively considered firing Sessions, but has wondered if he made the right decision in not doing so previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“And when he asks ‘Should I have done that?’ I say ‘No, the way it is now has worked out’,” Giuliani said.\nThe former mayor added that he did not believe Trump would fire Sessions. The president’s anger at Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse his fledgling presidential campaign and has remained a loyal supporter, comes from the attorney general’s move last year to recuse himself from the probe, a move Sessions said was in line with Department of Justice guidelines but Trump believes birthed the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller that is imperiling his presidency.\n\n\n\nTrump’s anger remains unabated and he suggested on Twitter again Wednesday that he wishes he had never offered the job to Sessions. Giuliani stressed that Trump had every right — whether in person or on social media — to “express how he feels” about Sessions, but suggested it was a distraction to his legal team’s efforts to fight back against the ongoing investigation.\n“Instead of talking about Sessions, we want to be talking about Comey and Mueller,” said Giuliani, invoking the former FBI director and the special counsel. “Public opinion is turning our way; we’ve had a great turnaround on this. We should be focused on that.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome in Trump’s inner circle have advised him against firing the attorney general because it could further ratchet up the pressure in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, as well as alienate a portion of the president’s conservative base who have cheered Sessions’ moves at the Justice Department. Moreover, a number of Sessions’ former Republican colleagues in the Senate have indicated they would not hold confirmation hearings for a replacement attorney general.\nThis could change after the midterm elections in November. Republicans on Capitol Hill want to avoid unnecessary drama ahead of the elections, but once Mueller completes his investigation some are now suggesting it may then be time for Trump and Sessions to part ways.\nThe mood is a shift from just weeks ago when Republican senators in particular seemed prepared to go to the mat for Sessions as part of their broader efforts to stop Trump from firing Mueller.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who golfed over the holiday weekend with the president, says he has reinforced to Trump that “the best thing for the Republican Party right now is to keep focused on good governance in the midterms.”\nGraham says while he shares some of Trump’s frustrations with the situation — particularly the Justice Department’s resistance to appointing a second special counsel to investigate the handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe — he doesn’t expect Sessions will depart “any time soon.”\nBut Graham added, these are “not lifetime appointments.” At some point, he said, Sessions will “have to make a decision” that if “you don’t have the confidence” of the president, “that will affect your ability to be effective.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Then, a week later, bowed out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, it’s not “America’s Sweetheart” Sandra Bullock, who starred in “The Blind Side” and “Miss Congeniality.” It’s a retired Georgia Tech database administrator Sandra Bullock, who lives in Smyrna, Ga.\nBullock, who would not respond to Fox News’ inquiries, didn’t knock on doors, hand out campaign signs or set up social media accounts pushing for her win.\n\n“I thought, let’s see what my silly name will do, and I won!” Bullock told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Apparently, name recognition and voting for Democratic women counts for a lot.”\nIn Georgia, sharing a name with someone famous seems to carry weight – even for candidates with no political experience and who make little effort to win their race. On the same day Bullock won, Viola Davis unseated State Rep. Earnest “Coach” Williams for the Democratic primary in District 87. Williams had served on the state House since 2003.\nDavis, a veteran, registered nurse and long-time community activist, told Fox News she appreciates sharing the name of a well-liked celebrity and Oscar winner and admits it probably helped her earn some votes. But, unlike Bullock, Davis actually made an effort to win.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the same day Sandra Bullock won, Viola Davis (above) unseated State Rep. Earnest “Coach” Williams for the Democratic primary in District 87. Williams had served on the state House since 2003.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\nDavis said she knocked on nearly 4,500 doors in the neighborhood. She is running unopposed in the general election.\n“Believe me when I say, it was hard work,” Davis said. “My body is feeling it right now.”\n\n            \n            \n                \n                \n                    https://www.facebook.com/pg/allenforgeorgia/posts/\n                \n            \n        \nOn Wednesday, Bullock abruptly pulled out of the race, citing health reasons. But before she quit, her opponent, Erick Allen, a talent management consultant, said he was taken aback that someone who did not bother campaigning won the primary.\n\n"We have to have a serious discussion about voter education and engagement. The fact that ‘Sandra Bullock’ won and a long term incumbent lost to ‘Viola Davis’ speaks loudly."\n- Erick Allen on Facebook\n\n“I was not planning to lose to a ghost candidate,” he said.\nBullock captured 58 percent of the vote, according to the office of Georgia’s Secretary of State.\n“I find it very hard to believe [the votes were casted] off of an informed decision,” Allen said.\nIn a Facebook post the day after the primary, Allen wrote: “We have to have a serious discussion about\xa0voter education and engagement. The fact that ‘Sandra Bullock’ won and a long-term incumbent lost to ‘Viola Davis’ speaks loudly.”\nAudrey Haynes, an associate professor of political science at the University of Georgia, told Fox News when voters can’t use partisanship to make a decision, and voters have less information on races as they move down the ballot, name recognition sways voters because “familiarity is linked with safety and security.”\nAfter much shock and time in what he called “The Twilight Zone,” Allen will be the one to move forward as the Democratic nominee in District 40’s House race after Bullock dropped out.\nCobb County Democratic Party Chairman Michael Owens said Bullock is battling newly developed health issues, which would be hard to maintain while campaigning through November.\nOwens told Fox News Bullock’s run was never a joke – she was responding to her party’s call for more women to run and felt inspired to bring change to her community.\n\xa0\n\nEmilie Ikeda is a multimedia reporter based in Atlanta.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Opponents view it as a betrayal of Ireland\'s commitment to protect the unborn in the largely Roman Catholic country.\n\n\n\nThe country’s leaders were in favor of repeal, calling it a once-in-a-generation opportunity to liberalize some of Europe\'s strictest abortion rules.\nPrime Minister Leo Varadkar tweeted his support for the repeal before a moratorium on campaigning took effect Thursday.\nThe historic vote comes amid a wave of liberalization in recent years, with the country voting to allow same-sex marriage three years ago and Ireland’s first openly gay prime minister taking office last year.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBenjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

Republicans now control both chambers of the state legislature. And the Democratic Farmer Labor Party—as it’s known in Minnesota—suffered a hit to the brand after Al Franken resigned from the Senate amid accusations of sexual harassment. The resignation also left voters to decide two U.S. Senate races this year, in additional to the likely competitive gubernatorial contest.\xa0\n\nTwo-term Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton’s decision not to seek re-election touched off this year’s battle for the state\'s highest office.\xa0\nSENATE RACE RATINGS AND FULL MIDTERM COVERAGE\nThe marquee name on the Republican side of the race is former two-term\xa0Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who is walloping his GOP primary rivals in\xa0fundraising, while U.S. Rep. Tim Walz is the\xa0leading Democratic candidate.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Walz is the leading Democratic gubernatorial candidate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball and Fox News Power Rankings\xa0rank\xa0the governor’s race a tossup. Inside Elections still classifies it as leaning Democrat.\nIn the primaries, Pawlenty’s chief opponent is Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson, the 2014 Republican candidate for governor. Meanwhile, progressive state Auditor Rebecca Otto and state Rep. Erin Murphy are challenging Walz for the Democratic nomination.\nNational campaign arms seem to anticipate the nominees. The Democratic Governors Association already is targeting Pawlenty for his past lobbying ties. The Republican Governors Association has focused on Walz for a recent comment he made on rural Minnesota\xa0being “mostly\xa0rocks and cows\xa0that are in that red area.”\nThe Democratic National Committee announced in May it would give a\xa0$100,000 grant\xa0to the Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor party for outreach to rural voters. This came after a\xa0Buzzfeed report\xa0asserted Minnesota Democrats are\xa0“becoming a party made up solely of the Twin Cities and upscale suburbs.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the runaway winner in fundraising, Pawlenty opted to forgo seeking his party’s endorsement at the June state Republican convention, heading straight into the\xa0Aug. 14\xa0primary.\nSkipping the convention is a sign Pawlenty has trouble with the modern GOP,\xa0said David Turner, spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, who compared the Minnesota contest to the 2017 Virginia governor’s race—which was expected to be close but turned into a big victory for centrist Democrat Ralph Northam over moderate Republican Ed Gillespie.\xa0\n“What we’ve seen in 2017 and 2018 is a high level of enthusiasm among Democratic voters,” Turner told Fox News. “Pawlenty is eerily similar to Ed Gillespie in Virginia. Both had harshly criticized President Trump in the past and lobbied for Wall Street. Now, Pawlenty is coming back to Minnesota and—like Gillespie—doesn’t know how to deal with the current Trump Republican party.”\nCarnahan, though, said the Franken resignation represented “chaos and discord” for Democrats.\nStill, the special election for Franken’s former seat and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s race are ranked solid Democrat.\nAfter Franken resigned, Dayton named his Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to the seat. Former George W. Bush administration chief ethics counsel turned-Trump critic Richard Painter later jumped into the Democratic Senate primary against Smith. On the Republican side, state Sen. Karin Housley is running, as is real estate developer Jerry Trooien.\nMeanwhile, Republican state Rep. Jim Newberger appears to be the leading opponent against Klobuchar.\xa0\nBut Republicans see evidence of a politically shifting demographic in both the gubernatorial and 2016 presidential races – a trend that could favor them in future elections.\xa0\nMinnesota was the lone state that favorite son Walter Mondale narrowly won in President Ronald Reagan’s 49-state landslide in 1984. Presidential contests, though, can be won and lost in the Midwest battleground states. While Trump lost Minnesota, he flipped Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin -- four Midwestern states then-President Barack Obama twice carried.\n“Republican victories in Minnesota would drive a stake through the Democratic Party at all levels,” Carnahan continued. “They will have lost the entire upper Midwest.”\nThe 2018 race in Minnesota also impacts who controls the state legislature for the next decade, and the congressional delegation. The House and Senate are responsible for drawing up\xa0redistricting maps\xa0after the 2020 Census, and the governor will sign or veto. Last time this happened, in 2011, partisan clashes led to a court battle over legislative maps. But, if the same party holds the governorship and the legislature, the process would be streamlined. That’s why the National Democratic Redistricting Commission is\xa0targeting\xa0the state.\nFred Lucas is the White House correspondent for The Daily Signal.

Judge Napolitano breaks down the cases.\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Arkansas to enforce a law restricting medication abortions, rejecting an appeal from the Planned Parenthood affiliate in the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood had asked the high court to review an appeals court ruling on the abortion pill rules and reinstate a lower court order that had blocked them from taking effect.\xa0\nThe law in question says doctors who provide abortion pills must hold a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital, and would agree to handle and treat complications.\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed a court order blocking enforcement of the law, but put that ruling on hold as Planned Parenthood appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe legal battle continues, but Arkansas at this point is allowed to enforce the law.\nPlanned Parenthood argued that if the law stands, Arkansas would be the only state where women would not have access to a pair of drugs that end pregnancies—mifepristone, which makes it difficult for the fetus to attach to the uterine wall, and misopostol, which causes the body to expel the pregnancy, similar to a miscarriage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood offered those abortion medications at clinics in Fayetteville and Little Rock, but said it could not find an obstetricians in the state willing to handle the hospital admissions.\nThe organization also argued that the law prevents women from obtaining medication abortions, and would infringe on their right to an abortion, otherwise known as an undue burden. Undue burden is the standard set by the Supreme Court when measuring whether restrictions go too far in limiting women who seek to have an abortion.\nCritics of the law say it could end medication abortions in the state.\nThe law is similar to a provision in a Texas law, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2016.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Avenatti has appeared on broadcast and cable news nearly 150 times over the past 10 weeks, with 74 of the appearances on CNN, according a Media Research Center report last week.\nBut amid controversy over his tax issues and a ruling on Tuesday ordering a law firm managed by Avenatti to pay up $10 million to an attorney for failing to honor a settlement deal, he has found himself on defense lately.\nANTI-TRUMP PORN STAR LAWYER MICHAEL AVENATTI SUDDENLY VANISHES FROM CNN STUDIOS AFTER DOZENS OF INTERVIEWS\nStorie-Avenatti, who has been married to the lawyer since 2011, reportedly kicked him out of the house and changed the locks. In court records, she provided examples of Avenatti’s alleged troubling behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations laid out in court records by Lisa Storie-Avenatti.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\nIn one instance, on Dec. 17, 2017, court records claim, Avenatti appeared outside their former marital residence and “angrily” demanded entry. He allegedly began shouting at his wife and threatened to stay at the house “every night of the coming week” against her consent.\nThen, he allegedly started filming Storie-Avenatti with his cell phone and said that he brought his 15-year-old daughter from his previous marriage to act as a “witness.” The wife tried to escape Avenatti’s “incessant tirade” and verbal outbursts, asserting that he was frightening both of the children, according to court records.\nAvenatti then allegedly called the police, asking for help to enter the property. Upon arrival, police officers refused his request. They later told Storie-Avenatti to “expect a nasty divorce.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAvenatti had a different recollection of the incident. He denied to Fox News that there was verbal abuse and said he never threatened to stay in the house against his wife\'s wishes, though he added that, “if I did, that was my right under California law.”\nHe said the police were actually supportive of him, but “stated they could not grant me access, but if I wanted to force access I could because I had every right to the home.”\n“The statements you are relying on were made in connection with Lisa\'s failed attempt to get a spousal and child support order of $215,000 a month ordered by the court. That never happened and the Court never gave any credence to her allegations,” Avenatti said.\nIn another incident, on Dec. 19, Storie-Avenatti detailed a meeting with her husband regarding a Christmas visitation schedule for their child, in which he allegedly threatened her again, saying he would “burn” all their fortune in the divorce. He also allegedly said he would ensure both of them get arrested to ensure their child gets placed in protective custody.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations laid out in court records by Lisa Storie-Avenatti.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\nAvenatti said the incident “never happened.”\n“[Avenatti’s] appalling lack of judgment in bringing his teenage daughter to act as a witness and frightening her in the process, demonstrated that he is a selfish and not child-centered, not to mention the emotional upheaval that he [caused] to Lisa,” an attorney for Storie-Avenatti wrote.\nHis “follow-up with threats on December 19 that he would intentionally deprive the parties’ son of his mother and primary care giver and cause [their son] to be placed into protective custody further illustrate that [Avenatti] is angry and vindictive, and has no regard for any emotional harm caused to his son, his daughter, or to Lisa,” it added.\nYet, despite the alleged conduct, Storie-Avenatti claims to be having problems legally separating from him.\n“I need to be divorced and if [Avenatti] continues to paint the narrative, he can ignore our case!” she told Fox News last week.\nAccording to court records, Avenatti’s “persistent refusal to cooperate” and respond to his wife’s discovery requests -- asking information about his income, assets and liabilities -- is causing a delay in the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegations laid out in court records by Lisa Storie-Avenatti.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n“This matter can neither settle nor proceed to hearing or trial without accurate and complete assessment of assets and obligations of the parties. Therefore, [Avenatti], by his willful refusal to provide sufficient and compliant responses … is causing needless delay in resolution of this matter,” Storie-Avenatti’s legal team said.\nAvenatti declined most requests for information about his finances, claiming the requests were “vague,” “ambiguous,” “overbroad,” and “unduly burdensome and oppressive.” He also claimed some requests were “protected by the attorney-client privilege.” He denied stalling the divorce proceedings.\nIn an email to Fox News, Avenatti also addressed a number of other allegations laid out by Storie-Avenatti in court documents, despite not being asked about them.\n“You are publishing this story as part of your attempt to discredit me and distract away from the serious legal issues surrounding Mr. Trump. You see me and my client as a serious threat to his presidency so you have decided to resort to personal attacks designed to malign us. It will not work,” he wrote in an email.\xa0\nAvenatti recently publicized information about large corporate payments Cohen received in exchange for "insights" into the young Trump administration, as well as payments from a Russia-linked firm. The details have led to widespread scrutiny of those deals, and brought the lawyer into the national public spotlight.\xa0\nStorie-Avenatti, meanwhile, was adamant in her email to Fox News that abuse did not take place: “To be clear, there was never any abuse, alleged or otherwise, in our relationship. I never feared for my safety or that of my son. Period. Michael has in the past been a loving and caring husband and is a loving and caring father. I never called the police because I was never threatened with harm. I never sought to have him excluded from our home because I felt threatened or feared for my safety or that of my son.\n“Further, he has paid all child support and spousal support. He is a good man. It appears you are trying to harm him and our family by publishing a defamatory story that has no basis in reality.”\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Eric Greitens resigns amid sexual misconduct scandal\nMissouri Republican governor, once considered a GOP rising star, announces his resignation amid an impeachment effort sparked by a pair of scandals; Matt Finn reports.\n\n\n\n\nEric Greitens, the embattled Republican Missouri governor facing a sexual misconduct scandal and allegations of misuse of a charity donor list,\xa0said Tuesday he will resign this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreitens said during a news conference that "the last few months have been incredibly difficult."\n"This ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family. Millions of dollars of mounting legal bills, endless personal attacks designed to cause maximum damage to family and friends," Greitens said. "Legal harassment of colleagues, friends and campaign workers, and it\'s clear that for the forces that oppose us, there is no end in sight."\n\nHe continued, "I cannot allow those forces to continue to cause pain and difficulty to the people that I love."\nGreitens added that he was "not perfect" but insisted he hadn\'t "broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment."\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Greitens, the embattled Republican Missouri governor facing a sexual misconduct scandal and allegations of misuse of a charity donor list, said Tuesday he will resign this week.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nGREITENS ACCUSER STANDS BY SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS, APOLOGIZES TO MISSOURI GOVERNOR\'S WIFE\n\n\n\n"I will let the fairness of this process be judged by history," he said.\nGreitens previously had said he\xa0would not quit\xa0his post despite the allegations against him. He was facing possible impeachment.\nThe 44-year-old lawmaker, a onetime Navy SEAL,\xa0has been accused\xa0of taking and transmitting a non-consensual -- partially nude -- photo of a woman with whom he was having an affair.\nA felony invasion-of-privacy charge levied against him has been dropped, however a special prosecutor has been considering whether to refile it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso being investigated is The Mission Continues, a veterans charity founded by Greitens, as it relates to the state\'s consumer protection and charitable registration and reporting laws. The probe came after media reports suggested Greiten\'s campaign had obtained and used a charity donor list in 2015 as it ramped up fundraising for his gubernatorial bid.\nIn April, Greitens was charged with a felony of tampering with computer data for allegedly disclosing the charity\'s donor list to his political fundraiser in 2015 without permission.\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said Tuesday her office has reached a "fair and just resolution" on criminal charges against Greitens, now that he\'s stepping down. Further details will be released Wednesday, she said.\nMISSOURI GOV. GREITENS ACCUSED OF VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, BLACKMAIL: WHAT TO KNOW\nGreitens likely will be replaced by Missouri Lieutenant Gov. Mike Parson.\nParson was elected as the state\'s 47th lieutenant governor in November 2016 and previously served in the state\'s senate and house of representatives.\nGreitens said it was "a great honor and a privilege" to be governor and he "will always be a fighter for the people of Missouri."\n"The time has come though, to tend to those who have been wounded, and to care for those who need us most," he said.\nGreitens assumed office in January 2017, defeating Democrat and former Attorney General Chris Koster.\nFox News\' Matt Finn, Shannon Bream, Kaitlyn Schallhorn and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

"So, come on, man up and make your decision."\n\nMeanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\xa0told “Fox News Sunday”\xa0that President Trump’s legal team will “take it to court” if Mueller subpoenas him as part of the Russia probe.\n\nRudy Giuliani says prosecutors have "everything" they need in investigation, calling subpoena for Pres. Trump "unnecessary.""They have to make a decision without it. So, come on, man up and make your decision." https://t.co/PrlQ2HcNQh pic.twitter.com/0jjzzoQAnK— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) June 3, 2018\n\n\n"They will take it to court, and I believe the court’s going to be on the president’s side on this,” Lewandowski said Sunday.\nGiuliani said he would keep an "open mind" about whether Trump would testify under oath in the probe, but added: "I have to just be honest, we are leaning towards not."\n\n\n\nMueller is wary of overstepping his authority just months before the midterm elections, Giuliani said.\nTRUMP ATTORNEY SETS \'RED LINES\' FOR MUELLER\n"He\'s as sensitive as everybody to not doing another Comey and interfering horribly in the election,"\xa0Giuliani charged, referring to the former FBI director\'s decision to publicly announce the reopening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation shortly before voters headed to the polls.\n"I have a feeling that collusion has come up completely empty," Giuliani said, adding that he thinks the inquiry into any possible collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia has probably ended.\nAsked about the possibility that Trump could be impeached simply for lying to the press, even while not under oath, Giuliani laughed.\n\n"Congress is going to impeach somebody for lying to the press?  Come on. They do more lying to the press than anybody."\n\n- Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\n\n"Congress is going to impeach somebody for lying to the press?" he said. "Come on. They do more lying to the press than anybody."\nPresidents can technically be impeached for essentially any reason, and the articles of impeachment drafted against Richard Nixon cited his misleading statements to the American public.\nBut, Giuliani said, Trump would face potentially significant risks if he fired Mueller and shut down the probe into his campaign\'s supposed ties to Russia.\n"It could lead to impeachment, if he terminated an investigation of himself,"\xa0Giuliani said in a separate interview on NBC\'s "Meet the Press."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theory that Trump could also effectively short-circuit the Russia probe by issuing an unprecedented self-pardon,\xa0Giuliani added, was a complete non-starter.\n"The president of the United States pardoning himself is unthinkable ... it would probably lead to immediate impeachment," he said. \nCAN TRUMP SELF-PARDON? LEGAL EXPERTS WEIGH IN\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie agreed on Sunday, telling "This Week" that there is "no way" Trump will pardon himself.\nThe Russia probe is still expected to conclude by September 1,\xa0Giuliani said.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

Our government is only going to be as good as we make it.”\nWhile Barr is a Trump supporter, the president and his aides have avoided commenting on the tweet controversy.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the president held a rally in Nashville, Tenn., but did not mention Jarrett or Barr’s comments. When asked what the president’s reaction was to Barr’s tweets, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president has been “focused” on North Korea, trade and the economy.\n“The president is focused on North Korea. He’s focused on trade deals. And he’s focused on rebuilding our military, the economy. And that’s what he’s spending his time on; not responding to other things,” Sanders said Tuesday.\nAsked whether the president thought Roseanne’s show should have been cancelled, Sanders said: “That’s not what he’s spending his time on. And I think that we have a lot bigger things going on in the country right now.”\nBarr apologized following her tweet on Tuesday. \xa0\n“I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me—my joke was in bad taste,” Barr tweeted, noting she was “now leaving Twitter.”\nBut Barr returned to the social media platform Tuesday night, apologizing again and blaming her tweet on the prescription sleeping pill Ambien.\n\n@ValerieJarrett i don\'t know if u saw it, but I wanted2 apologize to u 4 hurting and upsetting u with an insensitive & tasteless tweet. I am truly sorry-my whole life has been about fighting racism. I made a terrible mistake wh caused hundreds of ppl 2 lose their jobs. so sorry!— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\n\nFox News\' Nicole Darrah and Gregg Re contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

The 89-year-old stepped down in December, citing health reasons, though several former female staffers had accused him of sexual harassment.\nMore than a dozen candidates have filed to run for the office.\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

They also reportedly talked “frankly” about how they could make the potential summit between Kim and Trump a success.\nThe meeting came hours after South Korea expressed relief over revived talks for a summit between Trump and Kim following a whirlwind 24 hours that saw the U.S. president cancel the meeting.\n"Kim Jong-un thanked Moon Jae-in for much effort made by him for the DPRK-U.S. summit scheduled for June 12, and expressed his fixed will on the historic DPRK-U.S. summit talks," Yonhap reported, citing the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). "Kim Jong-un told Moon Jae-in to positively cooperate with each other as ever to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations and establish mechanism for permanent and durable peace.”\nTRUMP WELCOMES STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA, SAYS TALKS TO REINSTATE SUMMIT ‘PRODUCTIVE’\nThe leaders of the neighboring countries said they would hold “high-level talks” on June 1 and also promised to “meet frequently in the future to make dialogue brisk and pool wisdom and efforts, expressing their stand to make joint efforts for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Yonhap reported.\n\nWe are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nThe talks between North and South Korea was initially supposed to occur earlier this month until it was called off by the North, citing military exercises conducted by the South and the U.S.\nPrior to Kim and Moon’s meeting, Trump suggested that his summit with North Korea may still go ahead.\n“We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date,” Trump tweeted.\nFox News’ Kathleen Joyce and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Jack Phillips speaks out on \'Fox & Friends.\'\n\n\n\n\nIt’s almost decision time for the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a full plate of issues before it: immigration, religious freedom and voter rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe justices already issued a ruling striking down a law that barred sports gambling in most states, a defeat for the federal government and professional and collegiate sports leagues.\nRead on for a look at some of the bigger cases justices\xa0are expected to decide\xa0or have already ruled on.\n\nFree speech\n\n\n\n\n\nJack Phillips, a Christian baker, was sued after he declined to create a cake for a same-sex wedding.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Rick Wilking)\n\n\n\nIn a test of free speech and religious freedom, the Supreme Court took up a case focused on whether a business owner has to create a product that is against his or her deeply-held religious beliefs regarding marriage.\nThe case Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission\xa0centered around Jack Phillips, who declined to create a cake for the wedding celebration of two gay men in 2012. Phillips maintained that he would sell anything in his store to the couple, but could not create a new cake to celebrate same-sex marriage due to his religious beliefs and convictions about male-female matrimony.\n\n\n\nIn a 7-2 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that the\xa0Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated Phillips\' rights under the First Amendment. However, in its limited ruling, the Supreme Court did not decide on the big issue: whether a business can refuse to serve gay and lesbian people.\xa0\n"The laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect gay persons and gay couples in the exercise of their civil rights, but religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression," the order read. "While it is unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons in acquiring products and services on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other members of the public, the law must be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion." \nReligious freedom\nAnother test of religious freedom before the Supreme Court comes with National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra. In that case, NIFLA, a nonprofit representing pro-life and religious pregnancy centers, is suing California over a law that requires pregnancy centers to inform patients about family planning options available in the state, including abortion.\nNIFLA President Thomas Glessner has argued that the law requires anti-abortion centers to be “advertising for abortion.”\n“Can the government impose and compel a faith-based ministry to proclaim a message that they are fundamentally opposed to with the risk of being fined or shut down? That’s the issue here,” Glessner previously told Fox News.\n\n"Can the government impose and compel a faith-based ministry to proclaim a message that they are fundamentally opposed to with the risk of being fined or shut down?"\n- NIFLA President Thomas Glessner\n\nSUPREME COURT TO HEAR ANTI-ABORTION AND FREE SPEECH CASE\nHowever, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra defended the law as a way for patients to get “accurate information” about healthcare options.\n“Information is power, and all women should have access to the information they need when making personal health care decisions,” he said.\nImmigration\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court, while the court justices consider case regarding presidential powers as it weighs the legality of President Trump\'s latest travel ban.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Yuri Gripas)\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments pertaining to the Trump administration’s controversial ban on travel by residents of a handful of Muslim-majority countries. The court is set to determine if the ban -- which affects people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen -- discriminates on the basis of nationality and religion in the issuing of immigrant visas.\nA decision in Trump v. Hawaii\xa0is expected in June and could become a precedent-setting ruling on the limits of executive power, especially in the context of immigration.\nUnion dues\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Janus sued because he didn’t want a certain fee deducted from his paycheck to go toward a union just because he worked for the state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Leah Millis)\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court could upend a decades-old precedent that allowed unions to collect fees from public employees, including ones who were not part of the union. The case of Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Council 31\xa0forces the justices to decide if so-called “agency-shop” arrangements are allowed.\nMark Janus,\xa0 employed at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, set the ball in motion when he sued because he didn’t want a certain fee deducted from his paycheck to go toward a union just because he worked for the state. His lawyers argued\xa0that the payment could violate First Amendment rights if someone is forced to pay a fee to an organization with different views than he or she holds.\nThe court has to decide if it will overrule its 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. In that case, it held that schoolteachers should pay unions as long as the money goes toward collective bargaining and other such issues -- not ideological causes.\nSUPREME COURT RULING ON COLORADO GAY WEDDING CAKE CASE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY PAST LITIGATION\nLee Saunders, president of AFSCME, has argued that strong labor unions are needed because they give “the strength in numbers [workers] need to fight for the freedoms they deserve,” including retirement plans and health care.\nThe high court heard a similar case in 2016, but the death of Justice Antonin Scalia meant the case ended in a 4-4 decision, Reuters reported.\nVoter eligibility\n\n\n\n\n\nActivists rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments in a key voting rights case involving a challenge to the Ohio\'s policy of purging infrequent voters from voter registration rolls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Lawrence Hurley)\n\n\n\nIn what\'s considered a pivotal case regarding voting rights, the Supreme Court has heard arguments as to whether states, particularly Ohio, can purge voters who haven’t recently voted.\nIn Ohio, voters who haven’t cast a ballot\xa0in a two-year period could be removed -- regardless if they are still technically eligible to vote, according to The Associated Press. Ohio will eventually remove these voters from registration rolls after a notice is sent and the person continues not to vote for the next four years, the state said.\nCivil rights groups argue this process will make it more difficult for some people to be able to exercise their right to vote.\nThe case is titled\xa0Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute.\nVoter rights\nThe Supreme Court is deciding what not to wear when voters head to the polls. In the case, Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky, the justices will determine if voters can wear certain apparel deemed political, such as a Tea Party-linked shirt or a “Please I.D. Me” button, to the polls.\nThis case began in 2010, when Minnesotan Andrew Cilek wore such apparel when he went to vote. One of the items voters were to decide on then, the Star Tribune reported, was whether Minnesota voters should have to show photo identification when voting. At first, Cilek was prevented from voting after he refused to cover up his shirt. He was later able to vote, but had to leave his information with poll workers.\n“Polling places are not pristine retreats from the real world,” Minnesota Voters Alliance attorney David Breemer has argued before the\xa0 court. “I don’t believe the government can sacrifice the First Amendment to make them that way.”\nOn the other side, those in favor of clothing restrictions argue it prevents people from being intimidated while voting. A lawyer for the state said these restrictions “protect the fundamental right to vote.”\nRedistricting\nShould courts step in when lawmakers draw up new district maps that favor their party? With Gill v. Whitford, the Supreme Court is facing just such a pivotal decision.\nThe court is determining\xa0whether Republican legislators in Wisconsin, who drew a new election map that skewed in favor of their party after they took control in 2010, went too far with gerrymandering. The court is also being asked to endorse a standard for redistricting that would then apply nationwide.\nRedistricting is a major issue in many states, and this case isn’t the only one the nation’s highest court has heard. Justices are also considering a situation in Texas, regarding a lower court ruling that said a redistricting map was intentionally discriminatory.\nSales tax\n\n\n\n\n\nIn South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., the Supreme Court is tasked with deciding whether online shoppers should be charged a sales tax.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Carlos Jasso)\n\n\n\nIn South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., the Supreme Court is tasked with deciding whether online shoppers should consistently be charged a sales tax.\nThe justices have heard arguments in a case that deals with how businesses collect sales tax for online purchases at sites from Amazon to Zappos. Currently, thanks to a decades-old Supreme Court rule, if a business is shipping a product to a state where it doesn’t have an office, warehouse or other physical presence, it doesn’t have to collect the state’s sales tax.\nWHO ARE THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES?\nCustomers are generally required to pay the tax to the state themselves if they don’t get charged, but the vast majority do not do so.\nBusinesses who defend the current rule say collecting sales tax nationwide is a complex and costly process, especially for the smaller sellers.\nPresident Donald Trump has urged the Supreme Court to side with South Dakota, saying in a tweet: “States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!”\n\nStates and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2018\n\n\nGambling\nAll bets are off after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that barred sports gambling in most states. The decision was a clear defeat for the federal government and major professional and college sports leagues that fought to uphold the ban.\nSuch betting is already legal in Nevada, and New Jersey voters and lawmakers passed a law to legalize sports wagering several years ago. But that state law was opposed by the NCAA, the NFL, MLB, the NBA and the NHL.\n\n"Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own."\n- Supreme Court ruling\n\nThose on the leagues’ side pointed to the\xa0Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal law that prohibited sports betting in all states except the four grandfathered in: Delaware, Montana, Nevada and Oregon. Nevada is the only state out of the four that has full-scale sports wagering, according to The Associated Press.\n"Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not,” the Supreme Court\'s 6-3 ruling said.\nMore than a dozen states supported New Jersey in the case.\nNew Jersey could see an uptick in annual revenue to the tune of about $9 billion with sports gambling legalized,\xa0the New York Post reported.\nPrivacy\nIn Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court has to decide whether the Fourth Amendment allows police to be able to use cell phone records that show the location and movements of the user without a search warrant.\nThe case involves\xa0Timothy Carpenter, who was arrested for being part of a sting of Radio Shack robberies in Michigan and Ohio. He was convicted, in part, after police obtained archived cellphone records showing him near the scene of the crimes.\n“Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives, police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause,” Nathan Freed Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Carpenter, said in a statement last year. “The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the longstanding protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records.”\nThe government said it does not need “probable cause” to obtain these records, kept by phone companies, because of a 1986 congressional law known as the Stored Communications Act.\nFox News’ Madeline Farber, Steve Kurtz, Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

He said all sides could avoid a subpoena fight if they can keep the questions focused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLewandowski stressed that he doesn’t think the president, though, would defy a court order.\xa0\nTRUMP ATTORNEYS SENT LETTER TO MUELLER CHALLENGING INTERVIEW\n\n\n\n“The president clearly respects the rule of law in this country,” he said.\nLewandowski also sounded off Sunday on the controversy the president has dubbed “spygate” – revelations that an FBI informant was in contact with several members of the 2016 Trump campaign. Lewandowski, who ran the Trump campaign until shortly before the Republican National Convention in the summer of 2016, complained that the FBI never contacted him.\n“Never did they notify me of their concerns about potential Russian meddling” or a “potential spy,” Lewandowski said.\nDemocrats have countered that the FBI didn’t appear to actually have a spy in the campaign, and ex-intelligence community officials have argued that law enforcement were just trying to find out more about Russian meddling.\nEven GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy has defended the FBI as having acted appropriately. \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Lewandowski said it looked like “selective enforcement,” adding: “There had better be accountability.”\xa0\nLEWANDOWSKI JOINING PENCE POLITICAL TEAM\nThe former Trump official, who recently joined Vice President Pence’s political action committee, has remained an adamant defender and ally of the president.\nAsked on “Fox News Sunday” about the controversy over President Trump’s recent pardon of conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza – which fueled speculation that Trump could be preparing to pardon figures connected to the Russia probe – Lewandowski said the president’s powers are clear. \xa0\n“Under the Constitution, he has the legal authority to pardon anybody,” he said.\xa0\nHowever, in reference to two former officials swept up in the probe, he said, "There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the president has ever discussed having a pardon for Mike Flynn or Paul Manafort or anybody else for that matter."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

The South Carolina resident applied for, and received, his trucking license.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I remember as a kid always being at my grandma’s house. Her house was right next to a main highway,” Mack said. “So, I remember being on the side of the road and a truck would come by and I would pull my hand down for them to beep the horn…childhood dreams.”\nBut Mack, now a truck driver for CCC Transportation, had to wait years for that dream to become a reality, thanks to a law that requires drivers of commercial vehicles to be over 21 to cross state lines.\n\nNow, Congress is considering a new piece of legislation proposed by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., called the Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy Act, also known as the DRIVE-Safe Act. It aims to allow 18 year olds with their commercial driver’s licenses, or CDLs, the ability to drive commercial vehicles across state lines in an attempt to help prevent a nationwide driver shortage.\nMost states allow truck drivers under 21 to crisscross a state, but those 18 to 20 are not allowed to cross state lines.\nMany truckers are reaching retirement age in the next decade and leaving the workforce, and companies say they are having a tough time hiring new drivers. In South Carolina alone, more than 8,200 locally owned trucking companies said they were suffering from a driver shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\nMack feels the legislation, which is currently being reviewed by the House committee, is important and will help bring a younger crowd of drivers to the industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Fox News)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Trucking Association published a report in October of 2017 showing that last year’s national shortage of 50,000 drivers may increase to 174,000 drivers by 2026.\n“The truckers would need to hire close to one million truckers over the next 10 years. You have a lot of people retiring,” Hunter said.\nSupporters say lowering the age limit would expand the labor pool. While the pay is decent – the average trucker’s salary is about $60,000 a year – it’s a tough job that requires drivers to be on the road for months at a time.\n“It’s such a crisis with the shortage of truck drivers – you can ask any business person, any fleet operator, any private business that has their own fleet one of their biggest problems is workforce, in particularly truck drivers,” said Rick Todd, president of the South Carolina Trucking Association.\nThe apprenticeship program would require the drivers under 21 years old to complete, at minimum, 400 hours of on-duty time, including at least 240 hours of driving time chaperoned by an experienced driver and equip all training trucks with cameras and a set a speed cap of 65 mph.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation set the rule decades ago because of concerns that drivers under 21 had a higher risk for accidents. \xa0\nNow, the proposal has come under criticism by some who agree with the DOT, arguing that allowing younger drivers behind the wheel of a truck is a recipe for disaster.\n“Young drivers both lack overall experience and are less safe behind the wheel than their older counterpart,” Todd Spencer, president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, wrote in a letter to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which is exploring the issue. “In fact, commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers who are 19 to 20 years of age are six times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe apprenticeship program would require the drivers under 21 years old to complete, at minimum, 400 hours of on-duty time, at least 240 hours of driving time chaperoned by an experienced driver and equip all training trucks with cameras, a speed governor set at 65 mph and active braking collision mitigation systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Fox News)\n\n\n\nThe association believes all efforts should instead focus on improving the industry instead of trying to hire more cheap labor.\n“This has been tried before and no one with any common sense thought it was a good idea,” Spencer wrote in the letter. “Nothing has changed since that time and no disruptions have ever taken place due to any perceived shortage of drivers. These latest efforts are just more ways to keep driver-churn going and keep wages as low as possible.”\nBut Hunter said the change is necessary because the trucking industry keeps America going by delivering goods, ranging from fresh vegetables to petroleum, around the country – and costs will go up on goods and the availability of those goods will go down if the issue isn’t addressed.\xa0\n“There is no downside to doing this because you already have people on the road that are in the ages of 18 to 21. They went through all of the training, all the safety stuff. So they’re already doing it, they just simply can’t drive over the state line,” Hunter said. “So, I think this fixes a dumb issue that Congress needs to fix.”\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n“…about half of our driver population is 52 years of age or older, which means they are going to be retiring in droves here soon. But yet, less than half of one percent are younger than 21,” President of the South Carolina Trucking Association Rick Todd said.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Fox News)\n\n\n\nMack feels the legislation is important and will help the industry bring in younger drivers.\n\xa0“I feel like a lot of kids that are underage will jump into it because there is no longer a wait,” Mack said, “you know, no limitation on where you can go or how far you can drive.”\n\nTerace Garnier is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Columbia, South Carolina.

An official said this week that the White House is also expected to give the Pentagon authority to conduct security reviews for nearly all government agencies as well.\nU.S. officials said the move comes after revelations that a Navy contractor who gunned down a dozen people at Washington’s Navy Yard in 2013 maintained his security clearance despite concerns about his mental health and a prior arrest investigators never reviewed.\n\nThe security check system has seen delays in recent months—with a backlog of approximately 700,000 people — including high-ranking federal officials who have waited up to a year to get clearance.\nJust last month, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner received his permanent clearance —16 months after the president took office. The delay, according to Kushner’s attorney, was caused by the backlog in the new administration, and Kushner’s extensive financial wealth, which required lengthy review.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nPermission granted: Kushner gets full security clearance\n\n\nThe transfer of responsibility from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to the Pentagon for nearly 3.6 million defense employees are already in the works. The program will involve a system of continuous checks that will automatically pull and analyze workers’ criminal, financial, substance abuse and eventually social media data on a more regular basis — rather than only ever five or 10 years as it is done under the current system.\n\n\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is the executive agent for the new program, setting the guidelines for the security requirements, based on federal investigative guidelines. OPM and the Pentagon will carry out the vetting process, in conjunction with DNI.\nAn official said the changes would result in at least a 20 percent reduction in the backlog within six months.\nDuring the first year of the program, the Pentagon will take over investigations for government employees seeking a renewal of their secret clearance, then over the next two years, will take on government employees seeing their initial secret clearance, and then move to employees seeking top secret renewals and initial clearances, according to an official.\nWorkers with secret clearance are re-evaluated every 10 years, and those with top secret clearances are checked every five years.\nThe program will cost an additional $40 million for fiscal year 2018 but the department expects to spend “significantly less” than the current $1.3 billion price tag for the program because of increased automation and other savings.\nThe Associated Press\xa0contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Griff Jenkins has the story.\n\n\n\n\nA former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.\nHis lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\n\n“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton. Hillary is still walking free. Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals. We want them to correct the wrong.”\nDaigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December. There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.\n“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said. “We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”\n\n\n\nWhile campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.\nTrump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nKristian Saucier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Courtesy of Saucier family)\n\n\n\nSaucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009. He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine\'s propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.\nSaucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked. But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton\'s emails.\n“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said. “They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.”\nSaucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.\nA felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage. Now, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said. “I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”\nBecause of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.\nDebt collectors called and his cars were repossessed.\n“With a pardon there’s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,” he said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”\nHe praises the pardons that Trump has granted after his, and takes exception at the criticism.\n“The Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don’t even get charged for,” Saucier said. “President Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn’t deserve what happened to me.\nConservative commentator Dinesh D\'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud.\nTrump tweeted Thursday: "Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D\'Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!"\nD\'Souza was sentenced in 2014 to five years of probation after he pleaded guilty to violating federal election law by making illegal contributions to a U.S. Senate campaign in the names of others.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nElizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

Democrats released a partial transcript of her interview Monday, including Hupp\'s account that Pruitt had her do personal errands, including house hunting and booking a trip for him to the Rose Bowl.\n\nStaffers also asked Hupp about an email that showed her reaching out to managers of the Trump hotel at Pruitt\'s request. Hupp told the House staffers that Pruitt was seeking to secure a used mattress from the Trump hotel.\nPruitt had told lawmakers earlier this spring that any house-hunting Hupp did for him was on personal time.\nEPA CHIEF SCOTT PRUITT HAS SPENT MILLIONS ON SECURITY, TRAVEL\n\n\n\nReps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Gerald Connolly of Virginia, the ranking Democrats on the House oversight committee and a subcommittee on government operations, respectively, call the errands a violation of federal law on gifts from subordinates. In their letter, the Democrats ask Gowdy to issue a subpoena for government records they say EPA is currently withholding from the committee.\nSpokespeople for Pruitt did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for Gowdy said the committee has conducted several transcribed interviews and obtained 2,350 pages of documents as part of our investigation into allegations of mismanagement and spending at the EPA. This month, the committee will interview additional witnesses and receive additional document productions.\n"Selectively releasing portions of witness interview transcripts damages the credibility of our investigation and discourages future witnesses from coming forward," said Amanda Gonzalez, Gowdy\'s spokeswoman. "The committee will continue conducting a serious, fact-driven investigation, and therefore will wait until the conclusion of our investigation to release our findings."\nPruitt has been under intense scrutiny since March, when media reports first revealed the EPA chief had rented a luxury Capitol Hill condo tied to a prominent oil and gas lobbyist for just $50 a night. Pruitt\'s daughter, then a White House summer intern, stayed in a second bedroom at the condo at no additional cost.\nOther recently disclosed examples of the Pruitt seeking special treatment include his repeated use of first-class air travel, luxury hotel suits and directing his security staff to use lights and sirens to speed through Washington traffic to dinner reservations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

As the story goes, Downer informed U.S. officials, leading the FBI to open its Russia investigation during the 2016 election.\xa0\nIt has long been suggested -- in court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, by Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the media -- that Mifsud was connected to Russian intelligence.\nBut that assumption -- that Mifsud was working on behalf of the Kremlin and reached out to Papadopoulos on the Trump campaign to tell him about hacked Clinton emails -- is now coming under fresh scrutiny.\xa0\n\n\n\n“The most fishy parts of the story are: Is Mifsud really a Russian agent?” former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy said Monday on “Fox and Friends.”\n“No evidence has been presented to support the claim,” investigative journalist Lee Smith also wrote\xa0in a lengthy story about Mifsud for RealClearInvestigations. “Although Mifsud has traveled many times to Russia and has contacts with Russian academics, his closest public ties are to Western governments, politicians, and institutions, including the CIA, FBI and British intelligence services.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt documents\xa0from the special counsel’s office refer to Mifsud as “an overseas professor” with “substantial connections to Russian government officials.”\nThe Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee,\xa0in their report on Russia’s attempted interference in the election\xa0released in April, described Mifsud as “Kremlin-linked.”\nBut Mifsud also had Western ties at academic institutions like the Link Campus University in Rome, the University of Stirling in Scotland, the\xa0London Academy of Diplomacy and the London Center for International Law Practice.\nIf Mifsud wasn’t working for Russia when he approached Papadopoulos, then who -- if anyone -- was he working for?\nFox News was unable to reach Mifsud, who has vanished from the public eye since his name surfaced in stories about the Russia investigation.\nBut Smith even raised the possibility that Mifsud may have actually been working with Western intelligence.\n“While most media accounts have simply repeated official claims that Mifsud is a sketchy character whose visits to Russia and academic contacts suggest he is working for Russian intelligence, a look at the available evidence challenges that narrative,” Smith wrote. “It also raises the possibility that Mifsud [may]…have actually been working for Western intelligence agencies.”\xa0\nBut that doesn\'t mean his conversation with\xa0Papadopoulos was part of any plot. In fact, Lee also suggested it is possible Mifsud wasn’t working for anyone, and rather was a “man who wanted to seem important by repeating a rumor he’d heard to another man who also wanted to seem important.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Mifsud.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\nIn a recent piece for\xa0National Review, McCarthy also floated the possibility that Mifsud is little more than a “Maltese academic who had no real Kremlin ties and no inside information about whether Russia actually possessed damaging information about Clinton, in the form of emails or otherwise.”\nIn any case, Mifsud has become an important figure in Mueller’s probe.\nPapadopoulos, who was 28 when he worked on the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Mifsud.\xa0\nA February memo released by the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee said the intelligence passed on by the Australians about the diplomat’s meeting with Papadopoulos “triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok.”\xa0\nBut\xa0Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, the wife of the former Trump aide, told Fox News\' Tucker Carlson that the discussion with Mifsud was little more than a "gossip conversation." She openly appealed to President Trump for a pardon if her husband faces prison.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe questions about Mifsud come as Trump is drawing attention to reports that the FBI used another individual as a confidential informant in connection with the Russia case. The informant met with several campaign officials, including Papadopoulos, during the 2016 race.\nHouse Republicans have pressed for more information about that informant, asking who asked him to reach out to campaign officials.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

Trump said Sunday that a U.S. delegation was in North Korea to plan for a potential meeting with Kim.\nTrump called off the summit earlier this month following increasingly harsh rhetoric from North Korea. The Treasury Department had come up with new sanctions to levy on almost three dozen targets, including Chinese and Russian entities, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n“The goal here is to achieve maximum pressure,” a senior administration official told the newspaper last week. “We’re still short of that.”\nBoth the State Department and South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said American and North Korean officials have been engaged in talks. Trump said in a Sunday tweet that a U.S. team had “arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself.”\n“I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day,” Trump said. “Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!”\n\nOur United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has said\xa0the June 12 summit could still happen in Singapore, even though\xa0he called it off\xa0on May 24. Kim could see a meeting with Trump as necessary to easing pressure from crushing sanctions and to winning security assurances in a region surrounded by enemies.\nWHAT TRUMP, KIM JONG UN WERE EXPECTED TO DISCUSS AT HISTORIC SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE\nIn March, the State Department\xa0announced new sanctions\xa0on North Korea after it found an illegal nerve agent was used to kill Kim’s estranged brother. In announcing the new sanctions, the State Department said it “strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons to conduct an assassination.”\nThe new sanctions topped an already mounting list levied against the hermit kingdom.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in had a surprise meeting over the weekend with Kim and said his North Korean counterpart had committed to sitting down with Trump and to “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”\nSOME LAWMAKERS PRAISE TRUMP’S DECISION TO CALL OFF NORTH KOREA SUMMIT AS ‘RIGHT CALL’\nKim, in a dispatch issued by the North’s state-run news service, “expressed his fixed will” on a North Korea-U.S. summit.\nFox News’ Elizabeth Zwirz and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

He was released in early May, and was “happy to return home,” McGrath said.\nThe former president arrived in Maine for the summer in late May.\n Bush has spent part of every summer in Kennebunkport since his childhood, except while serving as a naval aviator during World War II.\xa0 Friends of the former president have said he had been eager to return to Maine after Barbara Bush’s passing.\n\n\n\nFox News’ Katherine Lam and Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report.\n\xa0\n \n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

The state party has approved resolutions in the past voicing formal support for the Keystone XL, he said.\nTransCanada\'s spending in Nebraska is high compared to many companies that lobby state officials, said Jack Gould, issues chairman of Common Cause Nebraska, a political watchdog group.\xa0\nHowever, TransCanada spokesman Matthew John defended the contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"We participate in an open and transparent political process and will continue to support elected officials and public policies that promote the safe and environmentally responsible development of North American energy infrastructure," he said.\nThe Keystone XL pipeline would transport up to 830,000 barrels a day of Canadian crude through Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska.\nThe pipeline faces intense resistance from environmental groups, Native American tribes and some landowners along the route. who worry about its long-term impact on their groundwater and property rights.\nPipeline opponents say the company\'s contributions show it\'s trying to exert influence over the state\'s top elected officials at the expense of landowners who don\'t want the proposed 1,179-mile pipeline running through their property.\n"There is no question big political donations have bought some politicians," said Jane Kleeb, president of the Bold Alliance, a group that has worked to recruit and support candidates who openly oppose the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKleeb said activists have kept the project from moving forward for a decade, despite being outspent.\nIn addition to the campaign contributions, TransCanada has previously reported spending more than $1.2 million on lobbying in Nebraska between 2006 and mid-2017.\nLandowners in Nebraska have filed a lawsuit challenging the Nebraska Public Service Commission\'s decision to approve a route through the state.\nIn a separate legal challenge, Montana landowners and environmental groups have brought a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn President Donald Trump’s decision to grant a presidential permit for the project.\nLast week, Trump administration attorneys defended the pipeline in federal court.\nThe Associated Press contrbuted to this report.\xa0\n\nAmy Lieu is a news editor and reporter for Fox News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., would apply only to members of the Congress and would allow exceptions in certain cases such as suffering from a medical condition.\n\nThe amendment will be considered in a House Rules Committee hearing next week. Leaders of the Committee will then decide whether the amendment will be included in the final bill that funds Congress.\nYet the inclusion of the suggestion remains unlikely. The two lawmakers have repeatedly tried to impose similar measures since 2014 with no luck. A similar amendment last year was blocked in the committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal came following the resignation last year of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price who was revealed to have spent over $1 million on travel, including chartered planes.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is facing similar criticism as he reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on first-class tickets and chartered planes as well. Pruitt defended his spending, saying he was forced to travel first-class amid threats he received since taking the position.\nRuiz told McClatchy DC that he proposed the measure as an amendment because Republican leadership ignored the stand-alone bill that would create the restrictions for elected officials. He remains convinced it will pass the House, if it passes the committee.\n“The COACH Act should be voted on as a stand-alone bill to send a clear message to the administration and all elected officials that public service should be about improving the lives of the people they serve, not to gain comfort in their own lives," Ruiz said.\n\n"[Americans] are tired of Congress failing to do its job — like passing a budget on time — while members continue to enjoy perks at the expense of taxpayers."\n- U.S. House Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla.\n\nIt remains unclear how widespread first-class travel is among members of Congress. Some lawmakers, fearing for public outrage, decide to fly coach even if first-class is available at no extra cost.\nIt\'s also not known if the amendment, if passed, would save much money for taxpayers. Members of Congress use their allowances to pay for airline tickets, meaning savings from travel may just end up being spent on other expenses.\nStill, for other lawmakers, restricting first-class travel is about sending a message and increasing trust in government officials.\n"Americans have very little faith in Congress as an institution," Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., told McClatchy DC. "They are tired of Congress failing to do its job — like passing a budget on time — while members continue to enjoy perks at the expense of taxpayers."\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Employees who don’t want to belong to unions could potentially save hundreds of dollars every year if they would become free from paying the fees, according to the newspaper.\nCalifornia’s Legislature has already begun preparing for the exodus of union members, adopting a measure last year that requires public agencies to give unions a 10-day notice before new employee orientation events in a bid to sign them up for the union.\nBut anti-union activists are also stepping up their attempts to help workers quit their unions. \nThe Freedom Foundation, which encourages West Coast government employees to leave the unions, said it recently sent out messages to 50,000 California teachers with instructions how to leave the California Teachers Association.\nThe group also criticized the bills supported by the union. “If we’re not allowed to know where they are, we don’t know who’s working,” Sam Han, its California director, told the Bee.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Its giant trust fund for inpatient care won\'t be able to cover projected medical bills starting at that point.\nThe report says Social Security will become insolvent in 2034 -- no change from the projection last year.\n\nThe warning serves as a reminder of major issues left to languish while Washington plunges deeper into partisan strife.\nMore than 62 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and surviving children receive Social Security benefits. The average monthly payment is $1,294 for all beneficiaries. Medicare provides health insurance for about 60 million people, most of whom are age 65 or older.\nTogether the two programs have been credited with dramatically reducing poverty among older people and extending life expectancy for Americans. Financed with payroll taxes collected from workers and employers, Social Security and Medicare account for about 40 percent of government spending, excluding interest on the federal debt.\n\n\n\nUnless lawmakers act, both programs face the future prospect of being unable to cover the full cost of promised benefits. With Social Security that could mean sharply reduced payments for some retirees, many of whom are already on tight budgets. For Medicare, it could mean that hospitals, nursing homes and other providers of medical care would be paid only part of their agreed-upon fees.\nMedicare\'s problems are widely seen as more difficult to solve. It\'s not just the growing number of beneficiaries with the baby boom generation moving into retirement. It\'s also the unpredictability of health care costs, which can be jolted by high-priced breakthrough cures, and which regularly outpace the overall rate of economic growth.\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned on a promise that he wouldn\'t cut Social Security or Medicare, but he hasn\'t offered a rescue plan for either program.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, want to extend the social safety net by spending more on health care and education.\nBut government deficits keep rising, and the recent Republican tax-cut bill is only expected to add to the debt. That leaves less maneuvering room for policymakers when the day of reckoning finally arrives for Social Security and Medicare.\nIn principle, the U.S. is supposed to be paying forward its Social Security and Medicare obligations by building up trust funds to cover future costs. That money is invested in special government securities, which also collect interest. But when the money is actually needed to pay for benefits, economists say a government deep in debt could be hard pressed to make good.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has long been an advocate for overhauling the programs, introducing a voucher-like system for Medicare and calling for partially privatizing Social Security. But now that Ryan is leaving Congress, it\'s unclear who will take up the mantle for budget hawks. In any case, Republicans may have damaged their credibility on budget issues by voting to increase government spending and cut taxes.\nMany Democrats don\'t see a need for immediate action. Their formula is likely to involve tax increases to help keep the programs solvent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

That includes $4.5 million spent by Mueller’s team and another $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenditures attributable to the investigations.\n“The department will continue to dedicate and leverage resources to maintain strong program and financial management controls,” the DOJ said in the report. “Management takes its program and financial accountability seriously and is dedicated to ensuring that funds are used in a responsible and transparent manner.”\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017 by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Previously, the Justice Department said that during the May-September 2017 period, the investigation cost nearly $7 million – bringing the grand total to date to $17 million.\n\n\n\nTRUMP COMPLAINS ABOUT COST OF RUSSIA PROBE\nThat earlier sum included $3.2 million in direct Special Counsel expenses and $3.5 million for other DOJ expenses, covering costs like agents working on raids or interviews and other government contractors.\xa0\nThe spending report said these expenses would “have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence” of Mueller’s probe.\nMueller is investigating Russia’s attempted interference in the 2016 election, and whether there was any collusion with Trump campaign officials. The investigation has also ensnared other Trump officials, like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manfort, over other issues.\nTrump has repeatedly said there was “no collusion.”\nFox News’ Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

If I were the president and I picked someone to be the country’s chief law enforcement officer and they told me later, ‘oh by the way I’m not going to be able to participate on the most important case in the office,’ I would be frustrated too,” Gowdy said on “CBS This Morning."\nHe added, “There are lots of really good lawyers in the country. He could have picked someone else.”\n\n\n\nMinutes after the interview, Trump quoted those remarks on Twitter and concluded: “And I wish I did!”\xa0\n\nRep.Trey Gowdy, “I don’t think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country’s....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\n\n....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘oh by the way I’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too...and that’s how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn’t you tell me before I picked you.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\n\n....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” And I wish I did!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\nSources told Fox News that Mueller as recently as this spring had not raised questions specifically about the March 2017 meeting between Trump and Sessions at Mar-a-Lago. However, Mueller does have several questions he wants to ask Trump about Sessions’ recusal, including what efforts Trump may have made to get Sessions to reverse course.\nTrump has been highly critical of Sessions ever since the recusal, blasting the former senator for not launching full-blown investigations into Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and officials like fired FBI Director James Comey and fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.\nTrump\'s latest tweet on Sessions seems to go further than some of his past criticism.\xa0\nUpon Sessions’ recusal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took control of the Russia probe, ultimately appointing Mueller to investigate allegations of potential collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\nA Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the president\'s tweet.\xa0\nLast week, the president demanded that the Justice Department investigate revelations that an FBI informant was in communication with at least three Trump campaign associates—George Papadopoulos, Sam Clovis, and Carter Page. The president has dubbed these new revelations as “Spygate.”\nRosenstein instructed the Justice Department inspector general to investigate any alleged “impropriety or political motivation” in the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComey and other Obama-era intelligence officials, though, defended the FBI’s use of an informant—technically referred to as a “Confidential Human Source.”\nAnd on Tuesday, Gowdy told Fox News that the FBI acted appropriately, on the heels of a high-level briefing last week on the matter.\xa0\n“I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got,” Gowdy said on “The Story with Martha MacCallum” on Tuesday, adding that the move had “nothing to do with Donald Trump.”\nGowdy added: “It looks to me like the FBI was doing what President Trump said. ... President Trump himself in the Comey memos said, ‘If anyone connected with my campaign was working with Russia, I want you to investigate it.’ Sounds to me like that was exactly what the FBI did.”\xa0\nFox News\' John Roberts contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

The United States and Europe also disagree on climate change policy, the Iran nuclear deal and defense spending.\n\n"Whenever I’m thinking about Trump, I’m lost," said Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.\nDiplomats and analysts have complained about the deterioration of the U.S. alliance with Europe, warned of a diminished counterweight to Russia and said tension with the U.S. may provide cover for European firms to increase their trade with the Kremlin.\xa0\n"We\'re seeing, I think France especially, but also Germany trying to play both sides, trying to play the United States and Russia at the same time," said Alina Polyakova of the Brookings Institution. "That realization that Russia is not a reliable economic partner, that it is a security threat to Europe, much more than to the United States, has not quite sunk in, unfortunately."\n\n\n\nRussia mostly sells Europe natural resources and energy. Work is beginning on a massive, controversial gas pipeline between Russia and Germany.\xa0 Nord Stream 2 would double Russia’s gas export capacity across the Baltic Sea.\nThe United States’ ambassador to Germany told Fox News that the administration has pushed European firms and governments to pass on business with Russia.\n"The strategy for the United States, here in Germany and throughout Europe, is really to remind European businesses just what they\'re dealing (with) when they deal with Russia," said Ambassador Richard Grenell.\nHe pointed to European Union figures showing Russian trade with the EU is down since Russia invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea in 2014.\n"The Russian offense and activities speak for themselves," said Grenell. "Many businesses throughout Europe are very uncomfortable with that."\n\nRich Edson is a Washington correspondent for Fox News Channel.

The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018\n\n\n“Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job,” Trump tweeted. “The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast ... the killings must stop!”\nTrump\'s comment came two days after “Blue Wednesday” in Chicago, during which members of the city’s Fraternal Order of Police showed up at a City Council meeting to address their grievances against the mayor. They claim that Mayor Emanuel has “turned his back” on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Chicago police union claims that the city\'s Mayor Rahm Emanuel has "turned their back" on them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(REUTERS/Joshua Lott)\n\n\n\n‘BLUE WEDNESDAY’ IN CHICAGO AS UNION TAKES STAND AGAINST ‘ANTI-POLICE’ MAYOR EMANUEL\nDuring the meeting, members accused Emanuel of not taking their interests into consideration due, in part, to a consent decree with the federal government that’s in the works, The Chicago Tribune reported. The decree will give a federal court oversight over the Chicago Police Department.\nChicago police have argued that the decree is a shroud for even more anti-police policies.\n\n\n\n“You are more concerned with consent decrees, settlements, pandering to police-hating groups than negotiating a contract with us,” Patrick Murray, union vice president, said, according to the newspaper report. “Our members are starting to believe you have no intention of negotiating a contract with us until after the next election.”\nWOMAN APPEARS TO SPIT ON PRO-POLICE DEMONSTRATOR AT CHICAGO CITY HALL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome police officers staged a protest at City Hall, which became tense. One woman was reportedly seen appearing to spit at a demonstrator marching with police officers.\nThe move also follows the Chicago Police Board’s recent decision to put Officer Robert Rialmo on no-pay status over a fatal shooting in 2015 that was deemed unjustified by the board — but was ruled justified by Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.\nEmanuel does not sit on the independent police board, which made the ruling on Rialmo’s job status.\nEmanuel is in the midst of an election, as he runs for his third term as mayor.\nFox News’ Matt Finn contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

We need to elect leaders who will stand up to him and fight for our progressive values. #VA10 pic.twitter.com/YpUe0NvwT6— Dan Helmer (@HelmerVA10) May 30, 2018\n\n\nThe ad was put up by Virginia Democratic House candidate Dan Helmer.\n“After 9/11, the greatest threat to our democracy lived in a cave. Today, he lives in the White House,” Helmer, who is challenging incumbent GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, says in the ad. In the video, an image of bin Laden is shown before the camera pans to the White House and Trump.\nDEM CANDIDATE COMPARES TRUMP TO BIN LADEN IN NEW CAMPAIGN AD\n\n\n\n“No one, not even the president, is above the law,” he continues.\nOn his campaign website, Helmer says he and his wife “were shocked by the 2016 elections and alarmed at the actions of this Administration and Congress.”\xa0\nComstock, meanwhile, called Helmer\'s ad "outrageous," prompting Helmer to fire back at Comstock.\xa0\n\n"It’s an outrageous and offensive thing to say, and beyond the pale. In Congress, we have been standing with President Trump, on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our military, defeat ISIS and battle terrorism, and make the world safer...."

Federal background checks are required in order for someone to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer; private sales are not subjected to background checks.\n\nSerafin Gomez is a White House Producer for FOX News Channel, who also covered the 2016 election as a Special Events & Politics producer and former special campaign correspondent for Fox News Latino.

Kevin Corke reports from the White House.\n\n\n\n\nThe historic summit between President Trump and\xa0North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is back on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We\'ll be meeting on June 12 in Singapore," the president confirmed to reporters after hosting an hour-long meeting\xa0with a top North Korean official in the Oval Office. Following the annoucement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders\xa0announced on Twitter\xa0on June 5 that the summit is slated to take place at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island.\nIn a May 24 letter, Trump announced that he would pull out of the much-anticipated summit.\n\n"Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting," Trump said in a letter to Kim, though he thanked the North Korean leader for releasing three American prisoners\xa0held in the country.\nThe next day, Trump tweeted that the two countries are having “productive talks” about reinstating the summit.\n\nWe are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018\n\n\nNorth Korea demolished what it claimed to be its nuclear test site, on May 24, setting off several explosions over the course of a few hours in the presence of foreign journalists.\n\n\n\nKim met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the demilitarized zone for the second time in a month on May 26. The\xa0two discussed the peace commitments\xa0they reached in their first summit and how they could make the possible summit between Kim and Trump a success.\nThe June summit will be the first-ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader.\n“It’s important because of the potential opening it has; there is potential diplomatic progress,” former Vice Adm. Robert B. Murrett, a professor of practice, public administration and international affairs at Syracuse University, told Fox News about the planned summit.\nMurrett, who also serves as deputy director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at the college, specializes in national security, international relations, military and defense strategy.\n“This is something we haven’t been able to do for many years,” he added.\nFox News asked Murrett to explain what the summit could mean for this nation\'s future, and he answered three questions about the meeting Americans should know.\nWhy is this meeting significant?\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (L) are about to shake hands on their first ever meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nAside from the potential diplomatic benefits between the U.S. and North Korea, the summit could benefit other countries.\n“It not just about the United States,” he said, explaining that the meeting could have also been a win for “our partners in the east, such as South Korea and Japan, but also areas in the South Pacific region such as Australia.”\nHe added, "These talks have the ability to reduce security tensions in East Asia and present an opportunity for the U.S. to reinforce the strong links with South Korea, Japan and even China."\nWhat topics are Kim and Trump expected to discuss?\nDenuclearization will be at the fore, Murrett said.\nNorth Korea’s “nuclear weapons and ability to deliver them at long distances should be central,” said Murrett, who added that\xa0recent talks between North and South Korea\xa0“would suggest that it would remain a core issue.”\nBut Murrett also expected discussion of the Hermit Kingdom\'s role in the global economy.\nDespite various sanctions placed on the country, North Korea’s\xa0economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2016. But Murrett said diplomatic talks represent the “prospect of North Korea rejoining the family of the Asians” if only from an economic standpoint, potentially opening the door for the country to trade with more than just China.\n“It would be in the interest of the people of North Korea,” Murrett added.\nDoes Trump deserve credit for the summit?\n\n\n\n\n\nKim and Chinese President Xi Jinping met recently in China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Xinhua via AP)\n\n\n\nIn short: Yes. In part.\nWhile Trump deserves credit for agreeing to meet with Kim, his decision to do so was likely sparked by “the window of opportunity that has existed because of ongoing pressure” on North Korea to better its relations with surrounding countries and beyond, Murrett said.\nPresident Moon Jae-in also deserves a “fair amount of credit,” he said, citing the recent summit between the two Koreas and the display of unity at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang as one of “several steps toward unification in some fashion or another.”\n“Trump is one of many important players,” said Murrett, noting that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe were also key players.\xa0\nAbe met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, where the two “affirmed their strong determination to strengthen our shared resolve on North Korea, and increase the capability of the U.S.-Japan Alliance to confront all emerging threats to peace, stability, and an international order based on the rule of law,” the\xa0White House said at the time.\nAnd President Xi and Kim\xa0secretly met in May in China, Chinese state television announced after the North Korean leader had already left the country.\n"[The leaders] had an all-around and in-depth exchange of views on China-[North Korea] relations and major issues of common concern," the Chinese news agency reported, while Kim was quoted saying that he hopes to “build mutual trust with the U.S. through dialogue.”\nFox News\' Katherine Lam, Elizabeth Zwirz, Kathleen Joyce and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nMadeline Farber is a Reporter for Fox News.

His appointment also followed a growing Democratic outcry for someone outside the Justice Department to handle the probe.\nThe House Intelligence Committee\xa0released its heavily redacted final report of its investigation in April 2018. It said there was "no evidence" of collusion.\xa0\nHas anyone been charged yet?\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Manafort is one of President Trump\'s former campaign officials who has been charged in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\n\n\nMueller’s investigation has led to multiple charges – although none are directly related to misconduct from the campaign.\nIn his leading role, Mueller took over an ongoing investigation into\xa0Paul Manafort\'s\xa0financial dealings in Ukraine.\nManafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and\xa0Richard Gates\xa0were indicted in October 2017 on multiple counts, including: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements and failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.\xa0Manafort and Gates initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nNearly four months later, in February, the pair was\xa0hit with additional tax evasion and bank fraud charges, similar to the original ones.\nGates\xa0pleaded guilty\xa0to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges\xa0on Feb. 23.\xa0After the plea,\xa0Mueller moved to drop\xa0the 22 bank and tax fraud charges against Gates, possibly suggesting that the former Trump campaign official is cooperating and providing good information to Mueller\'s team.\xa0\nMueller also accused Manafort of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine. Manafort has continued to maintain his innocence, most recently pleading\xa0not guilty to\xa0charges including tax evasion and bank fraud in federal court on March 8.\nManafort joined Trump’s campaign ahead of the Republican National Convention to help wrangle delegates before becoming the campaign chairman. He resigned in August 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn speaks during a White House press briefing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\n\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser,\xa0Michael Flynn, has also been charged in connection with Mueller’s probe. Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to one charge of lying to the FBI – reportedly about his talks with a Russian ambassador.\nFlynn was Trump’s national security adviser for a short time, but his connection to the White House was rife with controversy that still bedevils the administration. Flynn resigned after less than a month in the position.\nAt issue was his contact with Moscow\'s ambassador to Washington. Flynn and the Russian appear to have discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia late in 2016, raising questions about whether he was freelancing on foreign policy while former President\xa0Barack Obama\xa0was still in office and whether he misled Trump officials about the communications.\nAdditionally,\xa0George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign, pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his connections with Russian officials.\nDuring his time on the campaign, Papadopoulos attempted to set up meetings between campaign officials and Russians on numerous occasions. He also interacted with a professor “understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials” who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had “dirt” on\xa0Hillary Clinton, according to\xa0court documents.\nAlex van der Zwaan, an attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about Gates in the Russia inquiry. In April 2018, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison, making him the first to be sentenced in the investigation.\xa0He\xa0was\xa0released from prison\xa0on June 4 and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.\xa0\nRichard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to using stolen identities to set up the accounts. The U.S. government said Pinedo was not aware he was dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts, however.\nAdditionally, 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities were indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly interfering in the election. Mueller’s case alleges those involved had a sophisticated plot to wage “information warfare” on the U.S.\nThe Justice Department did not say if the actions had an impact on the outcome of the election.\nDoes anyone else on Trump’s team have connections to Russians or the investigation?\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Jr., the president\'s oldest son, took a meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campaign. She was supposed to have damning information about Hillary Clinton.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Joe Raedle)\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Jr.,\xa0the president’s oldest son, got the administration into some hot water when it was revealed that he\xa0took a meeting\xa0with a Russian lawyer during the campaign who was supposed to have damning information about Clinton.\n“This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” an email about the meeting said in part.\nTrump Jr. maintained that the lawyer,\xa0Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not have any information to share and instead wanted to discuss the\xa0Magnitsky Act\xa0and other sanctions.\nManafort and\xa0Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, were also at the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nJared Kushner, who is married to Trump\'s daughter Ivanka, has been under FBI scrutiny as well. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Joshua Roberts)\n\n\n\nKushner, too, has been under FBI scrutiny. Married to\xa0Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, Kushner may possess substantial information relevant to the investigation, officials have said.\nAlthough he has denied colluding with Russians or knowing of anyone who did, Kushner has had private meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the controversial encounter with Veselnitskya, which occurred in the summer of 2016. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused him of not being forthcoming in the information divulged.\nSteve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist,\xa0agreed to meet with Mueller\xa0as part of his investigation, potentially avoiding appearing under subpoena in front of a grand jury. Sessions\xa0and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have already met with Mueller, becoming the highest-ranking administration officials known thus far to have submitted to questioning.\nAn attorney for the Trump Organization, made up of hundreds of companies owned by Trump through a trust and managed by his two sons, told The Associated Press that it’s been “fully cooperative” with Mueller’s probe. The company has turned over documents to investigators.\nWhat about Trump?\nTrump has said he is “looking forward” to being questioned by Mueller under oath regarding the investigation. Aside from his associates’ connections to Russians, the president has also found himself under scrutiny for certain interactions in office.\nTrump sacked FBI Director\xa0James Comey\xa0on May 9, 2017 – less than two months after Comey publicly proclaimed the agency was investigating ties between Russia and Trump’s campaign.\n\nJames Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2017\n\n\nThe White House maintained Comey was let go due to his handling of an investigation into Clinton’s private email server used during her tenure as secretary of state. But Trump\xa0has\xa0suggested that he considered\xa0the Russian investigation when he fired Comey.\xa0\nComey told a Senate intelligence committee Trump had asked for the FBI to drop its investigation into Flynn; the White House said Trump was not attempting to influence his FBI director.\nComey said he offered Trump repeated reassurances that he was not under an FBI investigation.\nAfter Comey’s dismissal, Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister\xa0Sergei Lavrov\xa0and\xa0Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the time, where he shared classified information regarding ISIS threats, the\xa0Washington Post reported.\nTrump told those officials that firing Comey – who he allegedly called a “nut job” – took “great pressure” off of him,\xa0The New York Times later reported.\nThe Trump administration\xa0sanctioned 19 Russian individuals and five Russian entities\xa0on March 15 for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election and engaging in cyber-attacks. The Treasury Department announced the sanctions, which included the 13 Russians\xa0who were already indicted\xa0in\xa0Mueller’s probe.\nWhat’s so controversial about the investigation?\nTrump has been critical of Mueller, calling his friendship with\xa0Comey\xa0“very bothersome.”\xa0Multiple investigators\xa0on Mueller’s team face questions about their potential biases – and\xa0two were reassigned\xa0from the probe.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nNunes memo: What is in the controversial document?\n\n\nHouse Republicans\xa0released a memo\xa0in early February 2018 that detailed alleged surveillance abuses used in the Russia probe.\nThe memo, put together by House Intelligence Committee Chairman\xa0Devin Nunes, R-Calif., did “raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the FISA process,” it said.\nTrump said the memo “vindicates” him in the Russia investigation.\nBut Democrats have dismissed the memo as "misleading," saying it was released by Republicans in order to push the narrative that the probe is biased against the president. Weeks later, they\xa0released their own rebuttal memo, which\xa0defends the FBI and Justice Department.\xa0\nHow did the Russian meddling allegations even begin?\nBefore Trump took office, tens of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and officials connected to Clinton were leaked.\nThose emails – released in July 2016 – purportedly showed the party favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen.\xa0Bernie Sanders\xa0and led to the resignation of party chair Rep.\xa0Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nBut more than just ousting Wasserman Schultz,\xa0intelligence officials concluded\xa0those responsible for leaking the emails were connected to the Russian government. In its assessment of the hack, the CIA concluded that Russia intervened in the election in order to help Trump secure the presidency.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Keith Ellison\'s history of controversy\nTucker: Powerful Democrat praised Antifa handbook and its violence tactics in tweet. It\'s not the first time Ellison has said repugnant things, and Democrats should be terrified. #Tucker\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic National Committee deputy Rep. Keith Ellison announced Tuesday that he’s running for Minnesota attorney general, a move that will likely require him to leave his party post as well as Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firebrand lawmaker announced his candidacy on Twitter as he filed papers for his campaign.\n“I am announcing my candidacy to be the People’s Lawyer, and to protect and defend all Minnesotans as your next Attorney General,” Ellison tweeted.\n\n\nToday I am announcing my candidacy to be the People’s Lawyer, and to protect and defend all Minnesotans as your next Attorney General. pic.twitter.com/XvHFPPKX7i— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) June 5, 2018\n\n\nThe decision followed a last-minute political shift in his home state of Minnesota, as incumbent Lori Swanson jumped into the governor\'s race on Monday. This opened the door for Ellison.\nIt’s not clear whether Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, will resign his House seat early or retire at the end of his current term. However, he likely will need to resign his post with the national party, where he is vice chairman.\nFox News has reached out to Ellison’s office for clarification on his plans with regard to the DNC.\n\n\n\nA recent Politico report suggested Ellison might have been looking for a way out of the DNC. The report noted he’s been “chafing” in his role as deputy to Tom Perez, who beat him for the chairmanship in party elections.\nThe same article also noted that he may be attracted to the role state attorneys general have had taking on various Trump\xa0 administration policies.\nEllison seemed to hint at those ambitions in his full statement posted to Twitter.\n\nYou deserve an Attorney General who will never stop fighting for you and your family. That is what I plan to do. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/2uPsH3aAlQ— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) June 5, 2018\n\n\n“No one – not even a President – is above the law,” he said, citing fights against immigration and environmental policy decisions.\nEllison is in his sixth term representing a reliably Democratic Minneapolis-area seat. He’ll face competition, though, in the state attorney general primary. According to The Star Tribune, he faces former Attorney General Mike Hatch, state Rep. Debra Hilstrom and Matt Pelikan, an attorney.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, were gloating in the run-up to Ellison’s candidacy announcement. An overnight Republican National Committee email blast questioned whether the decision means Ellison has “strong doubts about Democrats’ ability to take back the House this fall.” The email also noted Ellison represents the progressive and Bernie Sanders wing of the party and questioned whether those activists will “feel they’ve lost a seat at the table,” causing more headaches for Perez.\nEllison has been controversial in his own right. Earlier this year, he faced scrutiny after Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan claimed Ellison had visited him in Farrakhan\'s Washington, D.C. office. Ellison maintained that he has not met with or spoken to the anti-Semitic minister since 2013.\n"I do not have and have never had a relationship with Mr. Farrakhan, but I have been in the same room as him,” he wrote on Medium.\n\xa0\nFox News’ Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

"Mr. D’Souza was, in the President’s opinion, a victim of selective prosecution for violations of campaign finance laws.\xa0 Mr. D’Souza accepted responsibility for his actions, and also completed community service by teaching English to citizens and immigrants seeking citizenship."\n\nWill be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\nShe added: "In light of these facts, the President has determined that Mr. D’Souza is fully worthy of this pardon."\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump tweeted: “Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!”\nD\'Souza told Fox News he received a call from the president on Wednesday to notify him of the decision.\xa0\n"I am thrilled and relieved and elated and as an immigrant in America, my American dream has been under something of a cloud, so I\'m very relieved to have that cloud lifted," D\'Souza told Fox News on Thursday.\xa0\n\n\n\nD\'Souza said he and Trump spoke for about 10 minutes, calling it a "very pleasant and very exciting call."\xa0\n"President Trump told me he felt I had been treated very unfairly and he felt that I was an important voice for America," D\'Souza said. "He wanted to clean my record and adhere to continue doing what I\'m doing."\xa0\nD\'Souza tweeted later Thursday that "Obama & his stooges tried to extinguish my American dream," while thanking Trump.\xa0\n\nObama & his stooges tried to extinguish my American dream & destroy my faith in America. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for fully restoring both— Dinesh D\'Souza (@DineshDSouza) May 31, 2018\n\n\nThe conservative filmmaker had pleaded guilty in 2014 for donating $20,000 to New York politician Wendy Long, allegedly going over the contribution limit by directing other donors to give to her. He was sentenced to five years of probation and eight months in a halfway house, and paid a $30,000 fine.\xa0\nDespite his guilty plea, D’Souza and his allies have claimed for years that he was unfairly singled out for prosecution, and unfairly treated by the Obama administration.\xa0\nD\'Souza in 2012 made a hit anti-Obama documentary called “2016: Obama’s America.” The film examined then-President Obama’s past and early influences that may have shaped his political ideology.\nD’Souza’s 2014 indictment was announced by then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who was appointed by Obama and fired in 2017 by Trump. The indictment stated that D’Souza was charged with one count of illegally donating to a Senate campaign and one count of causing false statements to be made to authorities in connection with the contributions.\nD’Souza’s illegal campaign contribution was made in 2012 to Long’s U.S. Senate campaign. D’Souza pleaded guilty to using a “straw donor” to make the donation.\nA straw donor is a person who illegally uses another person’s finances to make a political contribution in their own name. Straw donor schemes are illegal under U.S. law, which states that no person should knowingly permit their name to be used to “effect such a contribution” and no person “shall knowingly accept” a contribution made by “one person in the name of another person.”\nD’Souza allegedly coordinated donations to Long’s campaign through friends and acquaintances. Long lost her Senate bid against now-Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.\nFox News’ Judson Berger contributed to this report. \n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

But on Friday, Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, rescheduled for June 11.\nA committee source explained to Fox News that the original hearing date was scheduled based on the assumption that the report would be out by the end of May. But the source suggested the report\'s release is now not expected until at least next week, prompting the committee to reschedule.\xa0\n\nThe panel has a rule requiring they provide notice for hearings one week in advance. The Judiciary Committee still does not have the report, though a draft version was submitted to the DOJ and FBI in mid-May so officials can identify any information that should be protected from disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA source explained that the delay in the release could be tied to that process.\xa0\nFor more than a year, Horowitz has been reviewing the FBI and Justice Department’s actions related to its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\n\n\n\nHorowitz’s investigation looked at a variety of allegations, including whether it was improper for former FBI Director James Comey to make a public announcement about not recommending prosecution over the Clinton email arrangement.\xa0\nIt has been reported that the IG review also is expected to hit FBI leaders for moving too slowly to review a batch of Clinton emails discovered toward the end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nHorowitz’s review has already put former top FBI official Andrew McCabe in legal jeopardy. The Justice Department’s internal watchdog send a criminal referral for McCabe in April to the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington in response to Horowitz’s finding that McCabe leaked information to the press and later lied about it to Comey and federal investigators, prompting Attorney General Jeff Sessions to fire him in March.\nThe Washington Post reported that Comey has since been questioned by the U.S. attorney’s office as part of a McCabe investigation.\nIn November, Horowitz said his team had interviewed dozens of people and reviewed thousands of records in the course of the investigation. He said his team was looking at whether “certain underlying investigative decisions were based on improper considerations.”\nHorowitz also is slated to testify before the House Oversight Committee this month. House Republicans also plan to interview three FBI officials linked to the agency’s handling of the Clinton email probe, as part of an ongoing joint investigation by the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees.\xa0\nIt\'s unclear whether any of those appearances might be postponed.\xa0\nFox News’ Alex Pappas, Chad Pergram, Jake Gibson and Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

His wife, Nicole Avant, also was appointed by Obama as ambassador to the Bahamas, serving from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nObamas sign multi-year deal with Netflix\n\n\nNetflix confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that Sarandos himself was directly involved in brokering the Obama deal.\n"Ted Sarandos is our chief content officer so of course he was engaged in bringing Higher Ground Productions to Netflix,” a company spokesman told Fox News.\nHigher Ground Productions is the name of the company established by the Obamas to produce content for Netflix.\n\n\n\nOBAMAS SIGN MULTIYEAR NETFLIX DEAL TO PRODUCE SHOWS AND FILMS\nAccording to the New York Post, which first reported Sarandos’ involvement in the deal, Sarandos and Avant bundled nearly $600,000 in contributions to Obama during the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix official Ted Sarandos and wife Nicole Avant, the former US ambassador to the Bahamas, have been big Obama donors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nAvant’s father, Clarence, a music executive, also bundled nearly $450,000 for Obama’s presidential campaigns, the Post reported. The newspaper said one source estimated the deal with the Obamas could be worth over $50 million.\xa0\nThe Obama deal also comes just two months after Netflix announced that Susan Rice, Obama’s former national security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, would be joining the company’s board of directors.\n“I am thrilled to be joining the board of directors of Netflix, a cutting-edge company whose leadership, high-quality productions, and unique culture I deeply admire,” Rice said in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix on Tuesday suggested Rice had no involvement in bringing the Obamas to the company.\n“Board members play no role in content decisions at Netflix," the spokesman said when asked about Rice\'s potential role.\xa0\nNetflix says the Obamas will produce a variety of content, including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries and features.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nAfter the Buzz: Can Netflix relaunch Obama?\n\n\n“One of the simple joys of our time in public service was getting to meet so many fascinating people from all walks of life, and to help them share their experiences with a wider audience,” Obama said in a statement last week. “That’s why Michelle and I are so excited to partner with Netflix – we hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world.”\nIt\'s not yet known what specific projects the Obamas will tackle. Sarandos, during an event in New York on Tuesday, denied that the former first family would be using the platform to turn Netflix into “the Obama Network.”\n“There’s no political slant to the programming,” Sarandos said of the planned Obama productions, according to Variety.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

It would have required the firefighter to work 9,280 hours in a year, despite there being 8,760 hours in a single year.\n\novertime pay allowed Thompson to clear over $400,000 in cash earnings for each of the past four years — despite drawing a regular salary that ranged between $86,000 and $92,000: https://t.co/wc3rPuDD8T via @Transparent_CA— TransparentCal (@Transparent_CA) May 24, 2018\n\n\nThe magazine crunched the numbers and claimed that the firefighter earned his base salary of $92,000 by working 2,912 hours at an hourly rate of $31.60. For overtime hourly rate, Thompson would earn $47.40, meaning that in order to receive $300,000 in overtime pay for the whole year, he would have had to work 6,370 hours – bringing the total hours worked to 9,280.\nRobert Fellner, director of the institute, said the firefighter’s ability to work that many hours “boggles the mind” and said that Thompson was likely taking advantage of generous contract provisions that boost overtime pay above the typical rate.\n\n\n\nThompson is reportedly known for mastering the way to max out overtime pay. Between 1993 and 1995 he earned nearly $220,000 in overtime, a 1996\xa0Los Angeles Times article reported. Thompson said at the time that most overtime hours are linked to covering for other workers at the stations and not to “fires or other emergencies.”\nIn 2008, Thompson earned nearly $180,000 in overtime pay, the Los Angeles Daily News reported, noting that the L.A. fire department\'s overtime budget skyrocketed by over 60 percent in a decade.\nThompson justified his pay a few years ago, saying he "basically lived at the station” and worked hard to earn it.\n"The first thing [people] think of is firefighters sitting around at the station, but they\'re not just handing out free money over here," Thompson told the San Diego Union-Tribune. "I\'m working hard."\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is reportedly considering another presidential bid, and some Vermonters wonder if that means the high-profile candidate will again miss key Senate votes while on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders adviser and former campaign manager\xa0Jeff Weaver\xa0told C-SPAN\xa0that Sanders "is considering another run for the presidency.”\nIn 2016, when his last bid for the White House was in full swing, Sanders missed a whopping 115 of 163 roll-call votes in the Senate, according to an analysis by\xa0Vermont\'s Seven Days\xa0newspaper.\n\nThat figure, which amounts to more than 70 percent of votes called, was higher than any of Sanders\' fellow senators in that period.\nAnd from 2014 and 2017, the total number of bills introduced by Sanders reportedly plummeted\xa0from 69 to just 18, suggesting a\xa0 lack of engagement in Senate work while out campaigning.\xa0\nSanders\' attendance record has mostly returned to normal since campaign season ended, and other senators who have run for president -- such as Republican Ted Cruz of Texas --\xa0have also missed significantly more votes\xa0during their campaigns.\n\n"The job as a senator is to represent ... the people of your state."\n- Bernie Sanders Senate challenger Brad Peacock\n\n\n\n\nBut Brad Peacock, a farmer who is challenging Sanders this fall, said the issue will be especially important in 2020 given Democrats\' fierce opposition to Republicans in Washington.\nSANDERS: DEMOCRATS\' \'BUSINESS MODEL\' IS A FAILURE\n"This next presidential election is going to be a defining moment in our country\'s history, so I want someone that is completely focused on that," Peacock\xa0told Vermont\'s Seven Days. "And the job as a senator is to represent ... the people of your state."\nA poll earlier this month\xa0showed that voters in New Hampshire, a key presidential bellwether that once strongly supported Sanders, may have cooled on the Vermont senator.\nThe survey, conducted by Suffolk University, had Sanders trailing\xa0U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., by 13 points and former Vice President Joe Biden by 7 points. Sanders was ahead of other Democratic upstarts, including\xa0U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California.\nHowever, Sanders\' relative absenteeism in the Senate in 2016 doesn\'t appear to have bothered his constituency.\xa0\nAn\xa0April poll\xa0conducted by\xa0Morning Consult pegged Sanders\' favorability among in-state residents at 72 percent, higher than any other senator.\n"It is amazing how many votes @SenSanders missed in 2016, but so far Vermonters don\'t seem to mind," tweeted Middlebury political science professor Matthew Dickinson.\n\nAnd so the local speculation begins:  https://t.co/YquIANDESp  It is amazing how many votes @SenSanders missed in 2016, but so far Vermonters don\'t seem to mind. #VtPoli #2020— Matthew Dickinson (@MattDickinson44) May 22, 2018\n\n\nDickinson also noted that in announcing his re-election bid for the Senate this month, Sanders emphasized "national themes" while making a fundraising pitch.\n"Reminder that congressional elections are increasingly nationalized," Dickinson tweeted.\n\nGregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

A source confirmed to Fox News that the memo described a meeting where Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein claimed Trump had asked him to reference Russia in his recommendation to fire Comey.\nRosenstein declined, and instead focused on Comey\'s handling of the Clinton email probe. Trump pushed back on Thursday.\xa0\n\n“Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!” Trump tweeted.\n\nNot that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\nA source with knowledge of the investigation told Fox News that Trump just wanted Rosenstein to mention that Comey told him he was not under investigation in the Russia case.\xa0\nBut McCabe\'s memo reportedly has been turned over to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose team is looking at whether Trump tried to obstruct justice.\n\n\n\nFox News is told that Mueller\'s team also has a copy of a draft letter written by Trump on Comey\'s firing -- Rosenstein originally gave that draft to McCabe.\xa0\nThe president ultimately fired Comey on May 9, 2017, linked to a recommendation by Rosenstein criticizing the director’s handling of the Clinton email investigation.\xa0\nSECRET MCCABE MEMO IN MUELLER\'S HANDS GIVE DETAILS OF COMEY\'S FIRING: REPORT\xa0\nRosenstein, over a week later, appointed Mueller to investigate Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.\nRosenstein was left leading the Russia probe for the Justice Department following Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal -- a decision causing immense friction between the attorney general and the president to this day.\xa0\nThe president said this week that he wished he appointed a different attorney general.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSessions, though, did fire McCabe in March, stating that he “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor—including under oath—on multiple occasions.”\nThat decision came as Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz determined McCabe authorized the leak to the media, but later told investigators he did not know who was responsible.\nMcCabe reportedly kept personal notes on his interactions with Trump, some of which included what Comey told him about his encounters with the president, Fox News\xa0reported.\xa0\nThe president, though, has denied McCabe ever took notes when meeting with him.\n“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?” Trump tweeted in March, following McCabe’s firing.\nAlso on Thursday, the president blasted the mainstream media for their reporting on the FBI informant who had communicated with members of the Trump campaign during the election. The informant communicated with Trump campaign advisers George Papadopoulos, Carter Page and Sam Clovis.\n“The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?” Trump tweeted.\n\nThe corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\nThe president has dubbed the revelations of the FBI informant as “SPYGATE” and called it “one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history.” Democratic lawmakers and former Obama intelligence officials have rejected that description.\xa0\nFox News’ John Roberts at the White House and Lukas Mikelionis contributed to this report. \n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Jerry Brown, whose annual salary stands at $195,803, excluding benefits.\n\n\nProposal wouldn’t let California public officials earn more than the governor https://t.co/X2dIDYSFuJ pic.twitter.com/Yu5GNLJxvv— The Press-Enterprise (@pressenterprise) June 2, 2018\n\n\n“The Governor of California is elected by the people to administer not only the world’s fifth-largest economy, but a state of nearly 40 million individuals that is one of the most diverse and complicated polities on earth,” Cervantes said.\xa0\xa0\nHer proposal follows similar measures proposed elsewhere to address what some lawmakers see as runaway public salaries, the Press-Enterpise of Riverside reported.\nBut opponents say reducing public executives\' pay would likely cause talented employees to go elsewhere for jobs.\n\n\n\nYet Cervantes’ idea has managed to transcend party lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Essayli, Cervantes’ Republican opponent in Tuesday\'s primary election, made a similar proposal in March, when he called for executives’ compensation in Riverside to be limited to the governor’s compensation.\nEssayli said his proposal would also cut benefits because “They’ll just game the benefits to make up the salary difference.”\nIrvine Mayor Don Wagner, who thinks a salary cap is ill-advised, said he believes pay should be commensurate with "level of responsibility.”\nAs for a cap, he added, "The unions are not going to let that happen.”\nClick here for more from the Press-Enterprise.\n\xa0\n\nBradford Betz is an editor for Fox News.

The former president\xa0was asked by NBC’s Craig Melvin if he would have resigned over his sexual affair with Lewinsky in the Oval Office if it occurred in 2018 at the height of the #MeToo movement.\n“I don’t think it would be an issue because people would be using the facts instead of the imagined facts. If the facts were the same today, I wouldn’t [step down], Clinton said.\n\n\nWatch part one of @craigmelvin\'s interview with Bill Clinton and James Patterson pic.twitter.com/UC8KAQw8Ge— TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 4, 2018\n\n\n“A lot of the facts have been conveniently omitted to make the story work, I think partly \'cause they are frustrated that they got all these serious allegations against the current occupant of the Oval Office and his voters don’t seem to care,” Clinton said. “I think I did the right thing, I defended the Constitution.”\nMelvin then asked Clinton if President Trump has been given a pass when it comes to allegations of sexual misconduct. The former president has apparently forgotten that adult film star Stormy Daniels has emerged as a household name for claiming she had an affair with Trump.\n“No. But it hasn’t gotten anything like the coverage you would expect,” Clinton said.\n\n\n\nDaniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, has appeared on CNN and MSNBC so frequently that federal Judge Kimba Wood warned him about the "publicity tour" last week. Trump denied all inappropriate sexual behavior accusations, including the allegations made by Daniels.\nThe #MeToo movement has seen several once-powerful men come under fire for sexual misconduct. The movement was kicked into high gear last year when Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein was outed as a sexual predator in a story that NBC News famously passed on running. A few weeks later, NBC star Matt Lauer was fired for sexual misconduct. \xa0\n“I like the #MeToo movement; it’s way overdue,” Clinton said. “It doesn’t mean I agree with everything. I still have some questions about some of the decisions that have been made.”\nMelvin then asked Clinton if he feels responsible for pain Lewinsky has suffered.\n“I felt terrible then, and I came to grips with it,” Clinton said.\nMelvin asked, “Did you ever apologize to her?”\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvey Weinstein being outed as a sexual predator helped spark the #MeToo movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n“Yes. And nobody believes that I got out of that for free. I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you, typically, have ignored gaping facts in describing this and I bet you don’t even know them. This was litigated 20 years ago. Two-thirds of the American people sided with me. They were not insensitive to that. I had a sexual harassment policy when I was a governor in the \'80s,” Clinton said before snapping. “You are giving one side and omitting facts.”\nMelvin said he was not trying to present a side. Clinton, clearly annoyed with the line of questioning, said he has already “apologized to everybody in the world.” The NBC News reporter then asked if he has apologized directly to Lewinsky.\n“I have not talked to her,” Clinton said. “I did say publicly on more than once occasion that I was sorry.”\nMelvin shot back, “You don’t think a private apology is owed?”\nPatterson then chimed in, saying the incident took place 20 years ago and mentioned other presidents who were accused of infidelity.\n“You think President Kennedy should have resigned?” Clinton asked. “Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned? Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions. I dealt with it 20 years ago.”\nOn Sunday, Clinton argued that impeachment hearings would already be in full swing if a Democrat were in the Oval Office and if the special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election were as deep as it is now.\n“I think if the roles were reversed — now, this is me just talking, but it’s based on my experience — if it were a Democratic president, and these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe impeachment hearings would have begun already,”\xa0Clinton told “CBS Sunday Morning.”\nFox News’ Andrew O’Reilly contributed to this report.\n\nBrian Flood covers the media for Fox News.

Catherine Herridge has the details.\n\n\n\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey was recently questioned by the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s office as part of a probe into whether Andrew McCabe, his former deputy, committed a crime by lying to federal agents, a Thursday report claimed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post report indicated that McCabe, whom Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired earlier this year just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension, could be charged criminally, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMcCabe was fired after the Justice Department\'s watchdog said he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said McCabe had not been forthcoming in regard to the handling of the FBI’s probe.\n\nHorowitz said McCabe misled both investigators and Comey, multiple times, about a media disclosure authorization. Horowitz then passed those findings to the U.S. attorney’s office to decide if a criminal charge was necessary, although a referral doesn’t mean charges will be filed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA five-year prison sentence could accompany a charge of lying to federal investigators. McCabe has said he didn’t intentionally mislead anyone.\n"This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally," McCabe said in a statement after he was fired.\n\n\n\n"I like [McCabe] very much as a person, but sometimes even good people do things they shouldn’t do," Comey told "The Lead with Jake Tapper" on CNN in April. "I think it is accountability mechanisms working and they should work because it’s not acceptable in the FBI or the Justice Department for people to lack candor. It’s something we take really seriously."\nThursday\'s report followed a revelation earlier this week that McCabe had written\xa0a private memo detailing the circumstances leading to Comey\'s firing. A detailed report from the IG on the handling of the Clinton investigation, meantime, is expected within days.\n\nMatt Richardson is an editor for Fox News.

Because if we don’t, we leave a vacuum. And I think the darkness fills that vacuum,” she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton is seen with her mother, Hillary Clinton, at a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, November 8, 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters)\n\n\n\nWhen asked by the Guardian how British people should respond to Trump’s planned visit in July, Clinton referenced her children, saying:\n\n\n\n“Well, I’ve been to multiple protests since the election. Charlotte’s been to at least three, maybe four. Aidan’s been to one. If I lived in Britain I would show up to protest, because I don’t agree with what he’s doing to degrade what it means to be an American.”\nOf her reported friendship with Ivanka Trump, current first daughter and assistant to the president, Clinton said the two haven’t spoken “in a long time” and implied that Ivanka is fair game in terms of her advocacy for her father’s policies.\n“She’s an adult. She can make the choices for herself. I mean, she’s 36. We are responsible for our choices. In 2008, I was really proud to support my mom — but I disagreed with her fundamentally on a few things, particularly her then opposition to equal marriage rights for LGBTQ Americans,” she explained. “I never defended that position, because it wasn’t what I believed was the right thing to do.”\nClinton said that liberals have been too focused on “tolerance” when it comes to different minority groups. In her view, that\'s not enough.\n“People tolerated casual misogyny, but casual misogyny is maybe the gateway drug. We have freedom of speech, which I do think is hugely important — and yet people thought you couldn’t dispute hateful things, because they’re like — well, it’s freedom of speech. Well, freedom of speech doesn’t mean there is freedom of consequences.”\nThe 38-year-old, who serves as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation and has two children with her husband Mark Mezvinsky, remains focused on electing Democrats but said the country will have a long way to go to repair the damage that’s been done.\n“I think the wreckage that we’re seeing at this moment is one that will, I hope, be repaired on the policy standpoint when we elect Democrats,” Clinton said. “But I think we will still then have work to do on repairing the tone in our country, the exposure of the real racist and sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic feeling which is on the rise in our country – a rot that has been exposed.”\n\nChristopher Carbone is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

The speaking series is a must-stop for presidential candidates or potential White House contenders.\n\n“I’ll try to decide early next year whether there’s another chapter in my public service career,” Holder shared. “At this point, I’m really focused on the work of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and trying to deal with this whole question of partisan gerrymandering.”\n\n“At this point, I’m really focused on the work of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and trying to deal with this whole question of partisan gerrymandering.”\n- Eric Holder, former U.S. attorney general\n\nAsked about the factors that will go into his decision on a presidential bid, Holder said, “Certainly chief among them is, can you win? Do you have ideas that you think will advance the interest of the people of this country?”\nLongtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley recently predicted that his party’s next presidential nominee will be someone under 55 years of age.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nHolder 2020? Former AG floats potential White House run\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the 67-year-old Holder argued the emphasis should be on experience and vision rather than age, saying, “I think that people need to be judged on the ideas that they have as opposed to the birthdate that’s on their birth certificate.”\nHe added, “I think there’s something to be said about youth, but there’s something to be said also about having adequate amounts of experience. I think the ability to combine vision with experience, I think ultimately will produce the best candidate, whoever that is, for the party.”\nTurning to Donald Trump, the nation’s first black attorney general said he wouldn’t label the president a racist.\nBut he added, “The president and other members of his administration have tried to use race as a wedge issue to divide the American people, and it is something that I think is reprehensible. It is inconsistent with who we say we are as a people and it is not what we expect from somebody who is supposed to be the leader of the entire nation.”\n\n“The president and other members of his administration have tried to use race as a wedge issue to divide the American people, and it is something that I think is reprehensible."\n- Eric Holder, former U.S. attorney general\n\nSpeaking two days after Roseanne Barr’s racist tweet about former Obama White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett led to the cancellation of her hit ABC show “Roseanne,” Holder took aim at Trump.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nPresident Tump: Eric Holder protected Obama\n\n\n“This president has given license to people to say and do things that might not have occurred in the immediate past in our country. And, I think that we are going to be dealing with that long after the Trump presidency, trying to get a handle on those kinds of issues, the kind of things that Roseanne said,” Holder argued.\nAfter his “Politics and Eggs” appearance, Holder is expected to lead a roundtable discussion at the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s headquarters in Concord on gerrymandering.\nHolder, who chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said the organization is “committed to having a far census in 2020 and fair redistricting in 2021.”\nTargeting the GOP, he added, “Without some kind of independent or bipartisan process to create districts, Republicans have an ability to draw a map that favors their own candidates right down to the neighborhood level.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

This one lifts me.”\nKaepernick was the first NFL player to protest police violence and racial injustice by refusing to stand for the National Anthem in 2016. But some fans grew tired of the displays, and President Trump hammered protesting players.\xa0\nEarlier this month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the league would fine teams and league personnel who do not “stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.” Goodell said the league unanimously agreed to the vote, though San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York abstained. The new overhaul does allow players to remain in the locker room for the anthem.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Journal reported that the depositions suggest the league was influenced to issue the new policy by Trump\'s activism on the matter.\xa0\nTRUMP SUPPORTS NFL\'S DECISION ON NATIONAL ANTHEM POLICY\xa0\nTrump last week said "the people" were the driving force.\xa0\n“I think the people pushed it forward, this was not me. I brought it out. I think the people pushed it forward,” Trump said on “Fox & Friends,” noting that NFL owners “did the right thing” by instituting the new policy.\nThe feud between the White House and the NFL began in September 2017, when during a rally, the president suggested that if a player knelt or refused to stand for the anthem, the owner should “get that son of a b---- off the field.”\nMiami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross reportedly said in his deposition that he thought Trump “changed the dialogue.”\n“I was totally supportive of [the players] until Trump made his statement,” Ross reportedly said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwner of the Houston Texans Bob McNair said he thought the president’s comments were inappropriate.\nBut McNair, Ross and Jones all reportedly acknowledged that the protests were financially hurting their teams.\nFox News\' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Nate Boulton touched them inappropriately during separate incidents.\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nA popular Democrat’s exit from the Iowa governor’s race Thursday amid sexual misconduct allegations could impact the party’s efforts to coalesce behind the eventual nominee and regain power in a state that has moved sharply to the right in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Boulton, a Des Moines attorney and state senator, suspended his campaign less than 24 hours after The Des Moines Register reported three women alleged he touched them inappropriately several years ago.\nBoulton’s departure comes less than two weeks before the Democratic primary for governor. More than 13,000 Democrats already had cast their ballots through early voting as of Wednesday, when the newspaper’s report was published.\n\nThe winner will aim to unseat Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in November. She has been serving the remaining term of former Gov. Terry Branstad, who stepped down last year to become U.S. ambassador to China.\nIowa Democrats have been sidelined by several election cycles that gave Republicans nearly complete control of the state’s congressional seats and a majority in the Legislature. Democrats insist the race shake-up and the circumstances surrounding it would not hurt their chances of winning in the midterm election.\n“People are engaged no matter which candidate it’s for,” said Megan Card, a 25-year-old state government employee who has been supporting one of the five remaining Democratic candidates. “That just doesn’t disappear when that candidate drops out. People realize it’s bigger than ourselves right now.”\n\n\n\nBoulton’s exit is expected to have a tangible impact on the June 5 primary. Iowa law requires a primary candidate to secure at least 35 percent of the vote to win an election. Anything less and a party convention of activists will pick the winner.\nIt’s unclear for now how many people voted for Boulton during the early voting period, but the figure could affect the required voting threshold for the remaining candidates. Boulton was polling second among the contenders in the race, according to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released earlier this month.\nBusinessman Fred Hubbell, the apparent front-runner who has spent millions of his own money ahead of the primary, could pick up enough of Boulton’s supporters for a flat-out win. A party convention might lead Democrats to ultimately back a different candidate who may have been behind the pack for months. The remaining other candidates are union leader Cathy Glasson, physician Andy McGuire, longtime party organizer John Norris and former city mayor Ross Wilburn.\nSexual misconduct has become a top issue in politics around the country, as a cultural reckoning over inappropriate behavior and abuse continues to take down powerful men in various industries.\nDemocrats in Iowa and elsewhere have sought to draw a distinctive line in their response on the subject.\nIn Iowa, Sen. Minority Leader Janet Petersen called out Senate Republicans earlier this year for how they handled the firing of a former caucus staffer who said in a lawsuit she was let go after reporting verbal harassment. The state settled her case last year for $1.75 million.\nPetersen, who had endorsed Boulton’s candidacy, released a statement Thursday calling on Boulton to resign from the chamber and said she would “support a full, independent investigation” if he doesn’t.\nThe state Democratic Party said in a statement that it also supports such an investigation.\nBoulton told KCCI-TV on Thursday he is discussing with his wife whether to resign.\nCody Woodruff is a 20-year-old student at Iowa State University who was an early backer of Boulton and had already cast a vote for him. Woodruff said he does not expect the scandal will tarnish Democrats in the general election because of their swift response.\n“Everyone, for the most part, has a pretty unified message that it was right for him to step aside from the governor’s race,” Woodruff said.\nGlasson, who had been trailing Boulton in the Iowa Poll, has called for progressive policies that include a $15 hourly minimum wage and a single-payer health care system. Hubbell, who hasn’t called for such polices, has branded himself as the best positioned to take on Reynolds in a general election.\nHolly Brown, a 37-year-old Democratic activist from Cedar Rapids who backs Glasson, said the last-minute change in the race could help Reynolds if she ends up running against a man. Glasson and McGuire are the only other two women in the race.\n“There will inevitably be some people who will feel more comfortable voting for her because they will feel that she is less likely to have incidents like this in her past come up,” Brown said.\nReynolds has been scrutinized for how she handled the March firing of a longtime political ally, Dave Jamison, who was accused of harassing female subordinates as the head of a state housing agency. Reynolds says she fired Jamison immediately after learning about the allegations, but she was criticized for keeping general details of the allegations secret for more than a month.\nIn the Register report, one woman said Boulton repeatedly grabbed her buttocks at a bar in 2015. Two other women said he rubbed his clothed crotch against them in separate incidents more than a decade ago.\nBoulton, who had been considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, declined to address the specific accusations but did not deny them. He apologized to the women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

The White House says the administration continues to "actively prepare" for a possible summit with Kim Jong Un.\xa0\xa0\n\nThe report, though, addressed the brutal conditions festering inside Kim\'s kingdom. It revealed 1,304 cases of alleged religious freedom violations in the country last year, while detailing the harsh treatment of political and religious prisoners -- and persecution of Christians.\xa0\n“The government continued to deal harshly with those who engaged in almost any religious practices through executions, tortures, beatings and arrests,” the report read. “An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners, some imprisoned for religious reasons, were believed to be held in the political prison camp system in remote areas under horrific conditions.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, Christian Solidarity Worldwide said there was a “policy of guilt by association” applied in cases of detentions of Christians, meaning that the “relatives of Christians were also detained regardless of their beliefs.”\n\n\n\n“Religious and human rights groups outside the country continued to provide numerous reports that members of underground churches were arrested, beaten, tortured, and killed because of their religious beliefs,” the report read. “International NGOs and North Korean defectors reported any religious activities conducted outside of those that were state-sanctioned, including praying, singing hymns, and reading the Bible, could lead to severe punishment, including imprisonment in political prison camps.”\nThe report was released by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who underscored the Trump administration’s commitment to “promoting religious freedom around the world.”\n“Religious freedom is in the American bloodstream,” Pompeo said at the State Department Tuesday. “The release of the report is critical to our mission to defend religious liberty, and brings to light the state of religious freedom all over the world.”\nIt\'s unclear whether the North Korea findings will affect talks over a potential summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. Trump last week sent a letter to Kim cancelling a June 12 summit in Singapore following hostile rhetoric from North Korea, but has since re-opened the door to a potential meeting.\xa0\nThis week, Kim dispatched his infamous right-hand man, Kim Yong Chol, to the U.S. amid a diplomatic flurry aimed at salvaging the U.S.-North Korea summit.\xa0\nKim Yong Chol is a longtime spy chief and vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party, and traveled to New York to meet with officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.\xa0\nTrump also plans to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on June 7 at the White House.\xa0\nThe State Department report also noted that North Korea has “detained foreigners allegedly engaging in religious work within its borders.”\nEarlier this month, Kim Jong Un agreed to release three American prisoners, following a meeting with Pompeo.\xa0\nKim Dong Chul, a South Korea-born U.S. citizen and former Virginia resident, was sentenced in April 2016 to 10 years in prison with hard labor after being convicted of espionage. He reportedly ran a trade and hotel service company in Rason, a special economic zone on North Korea\'s border with Russia.\nTony Kim was detained at Pyongyang\'s airport in April 2017 and accused of unspecified "hostile acts" against the regime. He taught accounting at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. In a statement, Kim\'s family thanked "all of those who have worked toward and contributed to his return home."\nKim Hak Song, an ethnic Korean born in China, was detained in May 2017 for "hostile acts." He worked in agricultural development at an experimental farm run by the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which was founded in 2010 with donations from Christian groups.\nBut another American detainee, Otto Warmbier, died in June 2017 -- just days after he was brought back to the U.S. with severe brain damage. He had been arrested in January 2016, accused of stealing a propaganda poster, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor.\nDespite the Trump administration\'s diplomatic efforts toward a denuclearization agreement, the report stated clearly that the U.S. government "does not have diplomatic relations with the DPRK and has no official presence in the country."\xa0\nThe report said that officials used "other mechanisms" to address religious freedom concerns in North Korea.\xa0\n"The United States cosponsored resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council in March and December that condemned the country’s \'systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations,\'" the report said. "The resolutions further expressed grave concern over the country’s denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and association, and urged the government to take immediate steps to ensure these rights."\xa0\nFox News\' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

REUTERS/Leah Millis - RC1B4F473AB0\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(LEAH MILLIS)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday signed into law a bill that would allow those with potentially terminal diseases to try experimental treatments and bypass the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe so-called Right to Try Act of 2017, sponsored by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., unanimously passed the Senate last August, and cleared the House last week on a party-line vote of 250-169 -- in a win for both Johnson and the Trump administration.\xa0\n"Today I am proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the Right to Try legislation into law," Trump said Wednesday. "We\'re going to be saving tremendous numbers of lives."\xa0\n\nThe president said the issue was "very personal" for him.\xa0\n"As I proudly sign this bill, thousands of terminally ill Americans will have the help, the hope and the fighting chance -- and I think it’s going to be better than chance -- that they will be cured, that they will be helped, that they will be able to be with their families for a long time, or maybe just for a longer time,” Trump said. “But we’re able to give them the absolute best we have at this current moment, at this current second. We’re going to help a lot of people. It’s an honor to be signing this.”\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nHouse passes \'right to try\' bill that helps terminally ill patients\n\n\nThe president was joined by Vice President Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, FDA Deputy Commissioner Anna Abram and FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, along with several "brave Americans" battling ALS, muscular dystrophy and other conditions.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe president said that he was seeking the "better bill" for "the people."\xa0\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nTrump to Congress: Give terminally ill the \'right to try\'\n\n\n"Not the pharmaceutical companies, not the insurance companies--I don\'t care about them. I really couldn\'t care less," Trump said, underscoring the importance of a bill for "the people."\xa0\nTrump has long supported the legislation, pushing Congress to pass the bill for the benefit of terminally ill patients during his first State of the Union address in January.\n“Patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives,” Trump said during his address earlier this year. “It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the ‘right to try.’”\nJohnson introduced the legislation in early 2017, authorizing patients diagnosed with life-ending illnesses to use unapproved medications—so long as they have undergone early testing on humans and are under continual evaluation. Patients also would have to have tried other treatment options.\n“Today’s Right to Try bill signing was a moment of deserved celebration for everyone who fought to return a little freedom and restore hope to terminally ill patients and their families. I applaud and thank them all," Johnson said in a statement to Fox News Wednesday.\xa0\nThe vice president Wednesday touted the "bipartisan" legislation to "advance the interests of the American people."\xa0\n"I want to thank the president who cares deeply about families of this country, especially vulnerable families--economically and families struggling with serious illness," Pence said. "President Trump has fought to advance interests of American families."\xa0\nSo far, “Right to Try” laws have been enacted in 40 states, according to www.righttotry.org. The only states that have not yet adopted the law at the state level are Alaska, Hawaii, New Mexico, Kansas, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island.\xa0\n“The FDA drug approval process can take up to 15 years. This is far too long for dying patients to wait,” the Right to Try website states. “Right to Try gives life-saving hope back to those who’ve lost it.”\nBut Democrats have been critical of the legislation, saying it would “peddle false hope” and place patients at risk.\nOver 100 groups representing patients and research groups called the final legislation Tuesday “unsafe.”\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Former special operations intelligence analyst Brett Velicovich weighs in on \'Fox & Friends First.\'\n\n\n\n\nSophisticated surveillance devices that intercepted cellphone calls near the White House and other “sensitive facilities” around Washington, D.C., were discovered in an 11-month federal study last year, a federal official wrote in a May letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter detailed a trial program that used a series of cellular network sensors to discover the use of International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, Ars Technica reported.\n\nDHS found evidence of cell phone spying near White House https://t.co/aoV7oz9sMg by @thepacketrat— Ars Technica (@arstechnica) June 1, 2018\n\n\nThe communication from Christopher Krebs, acting undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security\'s National Protection and Programs Directorate, was sent to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nDHS had previously written to Wyden on the matter March 26, Fox News reported in early April.\nHomeland Security officials were concerned that other IMSI catchers, often under the brand name StingRay, were potentially operated by foreign intelligence agencies targeting U.S. officials, the report said.\nIt was not clear who was operating the StingRay devices, but DHS was concerned that foreign adversaries might be involved, the report said.\n\n\n\nThe IMSI catchers work by simulating phone towers to “trick nearby phones into connecting,” which allows the devices to “collect calls, texts and data streams,” the Washington Post reported.\n\nDHS discovery of apparent cellphone surveillance devices comes after private testing found IMSI catchers near these sites: White House, Pentagon, FBI, Senate, Russian Embassy and Embassy Row. Would foreign intel agencies want to spy near these places? https://t.co/i4DSOtQVkh— Craig Timberg (@craigtimberg) June 1, 2018\n\n\nThe catchers must be near targeted devices in order to work and could also deliver malicious software to targeted devices in order to steal information or “conduct longer-term monitoring of communications,” the Post report said.\nDHS was aware of reports that a global cellular network messaging system called SS7 was being used to spy on Americans through their cell phones, according to the Post, citing Krebs’ letter.\nKrebs was nominated to assume a permanent role as undersecretary, but Wyden had opposed moving forward with his nomination, demanding more details on the IMSI catchers.\nKrebs penned the May 22 letter in response to Wyden’s request.\n“This admission from DHS bolsters my concern about stingrays and other spying devices being used to spy on Americans’ phones,” Wyden said Thursday in a statement. "Given the reports of rogue spying devices being identified near the White House and other government facilities, I fear that foreign intelligence services could target the president and other senior officials."\nMeanwhile, two senior White House officials told Politico last month that President Donald Trump uses a cellphone that isn’t equipped with sophisticated features to shield his communications.\nThe officials expressed concern that some of the president\'s communications could potentially be vulnerable to hacking or surveillance.\nWyden on Friday requested that the Federal Communications Commission conduct an independent assessment of the security of U.S. phone networks.\n\nAmy Lieu is a news editor and reporter for Fox News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Keith Ellison (@keithellison) June 5, 2018\n\n\nThe decision followed a last-minute political shift in his home state of Minnesota, as incumbent Lori Swanson jumped into the governor\'s race on Monday. This opened the door for Ellison.\nIt’s not clear whether Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, will resign his House seat early or retire at the end of his current term. However, he likely will need to resign his post with the national party, where he is vice chairman.\nFox News has reached out to Ellison’s office for clarification on his plans with regard to the DNC.\n\n\n\nA recent Politico report suggested Ellison might have been looking for a way out of the DNC. The report noted he’s been “chafing” in his role as deputy to Tom Perez, who beat him for the chairmanship in party elections.\nThe same article also noted that he may be attracted to the role state attorneys general have had taking on various Trump\xa0 administration policies.\nEllison seemed to hint at those ambitions in his full statement posted to Twitter.\n\nYou deserve an Attorney General who will never stop fighting for you and your family. That is what I plan to do. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/2uPsH3aAlQ— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) June 5, 2018\n\n\n“No one – not even a President – is above the law,” he said, citing fights against immigration and environmental policy decisions.\nEllison is in his sixth term representing a reliably Democratic Minneapolis-area seat. He’ll face competition, though, in the state attorney general primary. According to The Star Tribune, he faces former Attorney General Mike Hatch, state Rep. Debra Hilstrom and Matt Pelikan, an attorney.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, were gloating in the run-up to Ellison’s candidacy announcement. An overnight Republican National Committee email blast questioned whether the decision means Ellison has “strong doubts about Democrats’ ability to take back the House this fall.” The email also noted Ellison represents the progressive and Bernie Sanders wing of the party and questioned whether those activists will “feel they’ve lost a seat at the table,” causing more headaches for Perez.\nEllison has been controversial in his own right. Earlier this year, he faced scrutiny after Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan claimed Ellison had visited him in Farrakhan\'s Washington, D.C. office. Ellison maintained that he has not met with or spoken to the anti-Semitic minister since 2013.\n"I do not have and have never had a relationship with Mr. Farrakhan, but I have been in the same room as him,” he wrote on Medium.\n\xa0\nFox News’ Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Kennedy, the busboy who held the dying senator detailed his last words in a Friday report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuan Romero, who was 17 at the time of the 1968 slaying in Los Angeles, was working on that early June night when the presidential hopeful made remarks at the Ambassador Hotel, he recalled in an interview with StoryCorps, according to NPR.\nAfter Kennedy spoke to supporters, following his victory in that day\'s California Democratic presidential primary, he was reportedly ushered through the hotel’s kitchen, where he paused to greet employees, including Romero.\n\n"I remember extending my hand as far as I could, and then I remember him shaking my hand," Romero reportedly said during the interview. "And as he let go, somebody shot him."\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. SAYS HE’S NOT CONVINCED SIRHAN SIRHAN KILLED HIS DAD\nRomero, now 67, recalled Kennedy\'s final words.\n\n\n\n“Is everybody OK?” he asked, to which Romero said he replied, “Yes” before cushioning the senator’s head with his hands.\n"I could feel a steady stream of blood coming through my fingers," Romero reportedly said. "I remember I had a rosary in my shirt pocket and I took it out, thinking that he would need it a lot more than me. I wrapped it around his right hand and then they wheeled him away."\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nRFK Jr. says he\'s not convinced Sirhan killed his father\n\n\nThe following day, Romero recalled sitting on a bus near a woman who recognized him from a photo in the newspaper, the report said. After which, he reportedly remembered “looking at my hands and there was dried blood in between my nails.”\nKENNEDY DYNASTY FACES A RECKONING AS CONTROVERSIAL FILM HITS THEATERS\nRomero also detailed his first interaction with the New York senator, which he said took place a day before he was shot. Kennedy was reportedly making a phone call when the busboy and another employee arrived with room service.\n"He put down the phone and says, \'Come on in, boys,\'" Romero said, according to the report. "You could tell when he was looking at you that he\'s not looking through you — he\'s taking you into account. And I remember walking out of there like I was 10 feet tall."\nThat feeling reportedly stuck with Romero as the years passed. During the interview, he recalled purchasing a new suit and going to Kennedy\'s burial site to offer his respects in 2010.\n"When I wore the suit and I stood in front of his grave, I felt a little bit like that first day that I met him,” Romero reportedly said. “I felt important.

The same goes for your estimation of her show in the first place.\xa0\nSo powerful is the draw of political tribalism that people are now increasingly able to turn their tastes on a dime in order to conform with what is politically correct.\xa0\n\n\n\nBarr’s act in the show that it produced is all about being shocking. It was shocking when she spit and grabbed her way through the national anthem and it was shocking when she and her TV character so brutally assaulted conventional norms about middle class marriage and family.\xa0\nA generation ago she was admired on the left for skewering\xa0June Cleaver\xa0expectations for media moms. This time around her admirers have been mostly on the right since she has adopted her support for\xa0President Trump\xa0as her preferred outraged generation device.\xa0\nLike a lot of middle aged white dudes who suddenly started appreciating\xa0Kanye West’s rhymes, Trump supporters were excited to see someone who unabashedly rooted for the president, even if it was just an exercise in trolling liberals. After all it seems like that’s the point of a lot of what Republicans do these days. It tends to matter less whether something is good or bad or even congruent with a philosophy as much as it matters that something will “make heads explode.”\nSimilarly, Democrats express strange new respect for ultra conservative Republicans, like Sen.\xa0Ben Sasse,\xa0R-Neb., or even Attorney General\xa0Jeff Sessions\xa0when they bedevil Trump. And political correctness in cultural choices has a much longer history on the left side of the aisle. Surely no living human could endure a set of\xa0Kathy Griffin’s comedy unless they believe they were doing it for a political cause.\xa0\nBut now, Republicans are fully engaged in the act. This isn’t just the wistful nostalgia of\xa0Pat Boone\xa0or\xa0Wayne Newton\xa0from the Reagan era. This is full blown art as cultural weapon.\xa0\nIf you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there’s not much we can tell you. You drank the Kool-Aid and are mixing up another pitcher.\xa0\nWe don’t know whether or not the president will stay strong with Barr in light of her racist remark. Her comment came in support of the kind of batty conspiracy theories in which some in the president’s orbit – and sometimes the president himself – have trafficked.\xa0\nTrump has in the past defended racists and kooks who were part of his broader political tribe. This is, after all, a guy who gave an interview to\xa0Alex Jones.\xa0\nAnd it’s potentially useful for Trump to embrace the idea of Barr as a victim. This would work well with his general narrative that middle class white voters are being persecuted. There are obvious down sides in aligning oneself with someone with a record like Barr’s, but the president has already taken that leap with her. If whole controversy creates an enormous, divisive uproar, then it would fit very well with the president’s overall political style.\xa0\nIt is too late to try to get politics out of art and popular culture. When you are at a point where\xa0Taylor Swift\xa0is criticized for not taking political positions, you know that we are not going back to the old, more pleasant arrangement where people did not much know or care about the political views of their preferred entertainers.\xa0\nPolitics and culture are kind of like government and religion: Both are harmed by their co-mingling.\nIt\'s fine to debate whether or not Barr is too nasty to be on prime time television. It’s even possible that some good might come from such a discussion.\xa0\nAnd it’s understandable that people feel greater sympathy for those who feel sympathy for them. But what makes no sense is ever giving up your own taste in art to meet the expectations of your fellow partisans.  THE RULEBOOK: IT’S IN THE DETAILS  “Sense, perception, judgment, desire, volition, memory, imagination, are found to be separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations, and remain a pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 37 \xa0 TIME OUT: ‘THEY CALL ME BABY DRIVER…’ WSJ: “Over time, many other antiquated auto features have been ruthlessly abandoned—hand-crank starters and windows, carburetors and cassette decks. But stick-shifting has defiantly stuck around, joining ax throwing, rock climbing and ultramarathons as an activity people stubbornly enjoy despite its needless difficulty. …\xa0Thomas Plucinsky, a company representative for BMW, ‘There is no longer a logical reason to shift manually.’ Cars with automatic transmissions accelerate faster, drive more smoothly and get better fuel economy than stick shifts, he pointed out. One could argue that manually shifting a modern car makes about as much sense as milling your own flour, building a fire to heat your home or drawing water from a well. Even many pro drivers race automatics these days. … But many people still buy stick shift cars for ‘emotional reasons,’ Mr. Plucinsky said. ‘They enjoy the mechanical feedback, which is part of the fun of driving even if they are just commuting to work.’”  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.\nSCOREBOARD Trump job performance\xa0 Average approval:\xa041.2 percent\xa0 Average disapproval:\xa054 percent\xa0 Net Score:\xa0-12.8 points Change from one week ago:\xa0down 0.6 points\xa0 [Average includes: Gallup: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; IBD: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]  Control of House Republican average:\xa041.8 percent Democratic average:\xa048.4 percent Advantage:\xa0Democrats plus 6.6 points Change from one week ago:\xa0no change\xa0 [Average includes: CNN: 47% Dems - 44% GOP; CBS News: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; Pew Research Center: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Monmouth University: 49% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP.]  GARRETT DROPS RE-ELECTION BID DUE TO ALCOHOLISM WaPo: “Rep. Thomas Garrett (R-Va.) announced Monday that he is struggling with alcoholism and will abandon his run for a second term in Congress so he can focus on recovery and his family. Garrett, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, is the 48th Republican to retire or announce they will not seek reelection to the House this year, according to a list maintained by the House Press Gallery. Many are leaving in anticipation of a strong Democratic performance in congressional races this fall and out of frustration with partisan politics in Washington. Garrett, 46, was facing a robust challenge from his Democratic opponent, journalist and author Leslie Cockburn, who had raised more money and had more cash on hand than he had. In recent days, unnamed former staffers had accused him and his wife of mistreating staff who worked in his congressional office. But in a videotaped statement, Garrett, a former Virginia state senator, said his departure from politics was spurred by his addiction.”\nDistillery owner first to enter race to replace Garrett - WaPo: “Hours after Rep. Tom Garrett (R-Va.) made the surprise announcement that he will not seek reelection in central Virginia, potential candidates began jockeying to replace him and one officially entered the race. Denver Riggleman, a former Air Force intelligence officer and distillery owner who ran a short-lived campaign for governor last year, said he is seeking the Republican nomination to help pass President Trump’s agenda in Congress. ‘As we have all seen over the past few years, it takes a real outsider with real world experience to drag the swamp monsters to dry land,’ he said in a statement. ‘As a veteran and small business owner, I am perfectly suited for that task.’ Riggleman is the first candidate to publicly confirm he will run after Garrett announced his struggle with alcoholism, but there is a long list of other potential candidates, including four from the General Assembly.”\nTrump to hold rally in Nashville tonight - AP: “Trump is traveling to Nashville, Tennessee, on Tuesday to raise campaign cash for Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the party’s leading U.S. Senate hopeful in Tennessee, and to headline a rally with his most loyal supporters. Blackburn is expected to face Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen to replace Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who is retiring. The Tennessee campaign is among several races crucial to Trump’s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority. Trump is planning a series of political rallies and events in the coming months to boost Republicans and brand Democrats as obstructionists to his agenda.”\nMontana Senate race gets boost from outside cash - AP: “Outside money is pouring into Montana’s U.S. Senate race even before Republicans settle on a nominee to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, who has become a leading target of the GOP after drawing the fury of President Donald Trump. Four Republicans are jockeying for a last-minute advantage ahead of the June 5 primary. Their ambitions to topple the two-term incumbent were buoyed after Trump — who won in Montana by 20 percentage points — unloaded on Tester for releasing allegations that the president’s pick for head of the Department of Veterans Affairs loosely handed out prescription drugs and got drunk on duty. Among Tester’s would-be challengers, state auditor Matt Rosendale has emerged as the favorite of deep-pocketed conservative donors. Outside groups including two bankrolled by Illinois billionaire Richard Uihlein have spent $1.8 million pumping Rosendale’s candidacy. That’s almost twice as much as he’s raised himself.”\nVulnerable Dems say banking law is proof of their ‘independence from Washington’ - The Hill: “Three vulnerable Senate Democrats hailing from states President Trump won in the 2016 election are touting their work on a new bipartisan banking law, portraying it as proof of their independence in Washington. Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Jon Tester (Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.) co-authored the bipartisan legislation, signed by Trump on Thursday, that eases the regulatory oversight imposed on banks and credit unions by the Dodd-Frank Act. The senators say their bill is a prime example of their ability to work across party lines and solve problems, a message they are eager to bring back to voters in their home states. … Yet whether the law will turn into electoral gold remains to be seen. The banking industry remains deeply unpopular, and liberal activists have assailed the new law as a giveaway to the financial industry.”\nGov. Hogan releases first ad in reelection campaign - WaPo: “Gov. Larry Hogan released the first television advertisement of his reelection campaign Monday, part of a $1.3\xa0million advertising blitz ahead of the gubernatorial primary that is costing substantially more than some of his leading Democratic opponents have in the bank. With four weeks until the June 26 primary, Hogan and Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford have\xa0$9 million\xa0cash on hand and no Republican primary opponents. Their first television ad, which will air on broadcast and cable stations, highlights Hogan’s record on the economy and environmental issues, including efforts to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay.”\nMillennial midterm candidates starting strong - Politico: “[Colin Allred] — the newly minted Democratic nominee for a competitive House seat [in Dallas]— is part of a swell of young Democratic House candidates hoping to inspire higher turnout among fellow millennials in the midterm elections… At least 20 millennial Democratic candidates are running in battleground districts… Currently, the average age of a member of 115th Congress — nearly 58 years old in the House and nearly 62 years old in the Senate — is among the oldest of any Congress in recent history… [Elise Stefanik] was first elected at age 30. No woman has ever been elected to Congress in her 20s, but two 20-something Democrats — Sara Jacobs in Southern California and Abby Finkenauer in eastern Iowa — are serious contenders running in competitive districts. Illinois\' Lauren Underwood, 31, and Ohio\'s Aftab Pureval, 35, have already won primaries to take on sitting GOP incumbents this fall.  BIPARTISAN LAWMAKERS IN TALKS TO REVIVE DACA BILL Politico: “A group of senators in both parties is beginning to restart back-channel talks across the aisle and with the White House in hopes that the chamber will be ready to act if the House or the courts throw the issue back to the Senate this summer. But the Senate isn’t ready to take up the issue after a thoroughly unproductive immigration debate in February, followed by months of radio silence. And lawmakers are growing more and more worried the upper chamber could be blindsided by a call to action later this year. The House, meanwhile, has become a hotbed of immigration debate — and it’s preparing to take up one or several Republican bills in June. But even if the GOP is able to resolve its intense disagreements and pass something, the Senate is very unlikely to accept it, according to interviews with nearly a dozen senators of both parties.”  Report: DHS official says immigrant children aren’t lost, they ‘can’t be reached’ - \xa0CNN: “A top official at the US Department of Health and Human Services on Monday called reports that the agency has lost nearly 1,500 immigrant children false and misleading. The children are not lost, HHS Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan said in a statement. Their sponsors simply have not responded to follow-up calls from the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the HHS department that oversees the care of unaccompanied alien or minor children. The agency was under no obligation to make the 30-day follow-up calls to ensure that the children and their sponsors needed no additional services, he said. Now, this voluntary action is being used to confuse and spread misinformation, he said. … ‘While there are many possible reasons for this, in many cases sponsors cannot be reached because they themselves are illegal aliens and do not want to be reached by federal authorities,’ he continued.”\nNielsen goes against the boss on sanctuary cities - McClatchy: “[Trump’s] embattled homeland security secretary recently awarded nearly $1.7 billion in grants, some related to immigration, to states and localities across the nation, including so-called sanctuary cities, according to three people with knowledge of the grants. Kirstjen Nielsen authorized the grants despite objections of her top staff… Homeland Security officials said Tuesday that Nielson was bound by a nationwide court order that instructs the federal government not to withhold funding. Despite that, her top aides urged her in the day leading up to the awarding of the grants not to include the money for sanctuary cities, according to the three people, two of whom used to work at the department and remain in close contact with employees. … ‘She is known for deliberately ignoring warnings that her decisions are not in keeping with the president’s agenda, but that she proceeds forcefully and simply misrepresents what she is doing.’”  TRUMP ACCUSES MUELLER\'S DEMS OF MEDDLING  Fox News: “President Trump warned Tuesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the ‘13 Angry Democrats’ on his team ‘will be MEDDLING’ in the midterms by pursuing their Russia probe so close to the election. The special counsel reportedly is expected to lie low going into the midterms if the probe has not wrapped up by that point, so as not to be seen as swaying voters. But in a Tuesday morning tweetstorm, the president effectively argued that the probe is already threatening to interfere in the vote -- and questioned again why the team is not investigating ‘totally Crooked Hillary Clinton’ and Democrats. … The president was referring to the 13 investigators -- of the 17 total members on Mueller’s team -- who have registered as Democrats. At least nine have donated to Democratic candidates and causes. Mueller, though, is said to be a lifelong Republican and served as FBI director under former Republican President George W. Bush.”\nMichael Avenatti creating complications in Cohen probe - WSJ: “A lawyer for former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford has frustrated efforts by federal prosecutors to obtain information about a hush-money deal involving President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, according to people familiar with the matter. In public, Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s current attorney, has been among the most vocal critics of Michael Cohen, the lawyer who paid her $130,000 in October 2016 to sign a nondisclosure agreement about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. But behind the scenes, Mr. Avenatti has slowed prosecutors’ efforts to discuss the nondisclosure agreement with Ms. Clifford’s former lawyer, these people say. Mr. Avenatti also demanded to review documents investigators subpoenaed from Ms. Clifford’s former manager, they said.”  PLAY-BY-PLAY Supreme Court allows Arkansas to enforce anti-abortion pill law - Fox News  Trump mocks Dem Rep.

BRO…  BBC: “A man had to be rescued by police and the fire service after getting stuck in a child\'s swing in a play park. The 20-year-old had been firmly wedged in the child-sized seat for three hours before police were called to Landseer Park in Ipswich [England] at 07:50 BST. When a ‘shove and pull’ method of swing-release failed, the fire service arrived with a trusty screwdriver. The swing was taken apart and the ‘grateful but embarrassed’ grown-up was freed unharmed. A Suffolk police community support officer quickly realized the man - who complained he had been in there for three hours - was definitely stuck. There was no shifting him as the girth of his rear was clearly too wide for the child-sized swing. After taking the swing to pieces and releasing the man, crews from Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service put it back together so it could be safely used by someone of the right size.”\nChris Stirewalt\xa0is the politics editor for Fox News.\xa0Brianna McClelland\xa0contributed to this report.

Kobach (@KrisKobach1787) June 2, 2018\n\n\nBut many criticized the politician for riding a vehicle equipped with a large replica gun at the event attended by young children.\nPastor Johnny Lewis of Shawnee Community Christian Church criticized the candidate in a\xa0Facebook post, saying his six-year-old child “worries constantly about school shootings.”\n“Why was that necessary, sir? My child didn’t need that today. Don’t care what your position is on second amendment that is completely unnecessary,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKobach\'s vehicle for the parade equipped with a replica of a gun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Twitter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis also told the\xa0Kansas City Star\xa0that his concern wasn’t about Kobach’s support for gun rights, but rather about the potential upset he caused to young children who came to watch the parade.\n“My greatest concern today was not Kris Kobach’s political position… It was that in a world where our children… live with anxiety about school shootings and do intruder drills regularly that any politician thought it was OK to drive through a crowd of children with an automatic weapon pointed at the crowd,” the pastor said.\nDespite the backlash, Kobach remained defiant.\n“The outrage over the replica gun on the back of a patriotic jeep is the left trying to attack guns and your #2A rights. I will not back down in the face of a snowflake meltdown and outrage culture,” he\xa0tweeted.\n\nThe outrage over the replica gun on the back of a patriotic jeep is the left trying to attack guns and your #2A rights.

Jerry Brown to lead the Fair Political Practices Commission, came amid a power struggle that included efforts to reduce her influence, reports said.\nRemke resigned following months of turmoil at the agency, the Los Angeles Times reported. She reportedly clashed frequently with other commissioners, who were expected next week to push for a new structure that would drastically cut Remke’s role as the top political ethics cop in the state.\n\n\nThe turmoil at California\'s campaign watchdog agency continues. @CA_FPPC chairwoman Jodi Remke tenders her resignation to Gov. Brown, effective Friday.  https://t.co/qWtgKrIUWv— John Myers (@johnmyers) May 29, 2018\n\n\nShe was the only full-time official on the commission.\nIn the resignation letter, Remke celebrated her achievements at the agency, but said she remained “concerned with the proposed changes to the Commission\'s longstanding governance structure.”\n“I’m confident that during this busy election cycle staff will continue to build on the significant progress we have made in advancing governmental integrity and the public’s trust in government,” she added.\n\n\n\nThe resignation also coincides with the upcoming statewide primary election next week that typically draws multiple campaign ethics complaints to the agency. It will be seen how Remke’s departure affects the policing of ethics in the election, as the agency has been criticized in the past for slow response to any alleged ethics violations by political candidates.\n"Staff is used to and is prepared for the normal process of changes in the Commission as there are always new commissioners and chair every two to four years," Jay Wierenga, a spokesman for the FPPC, told the Sacramento Bee, adding that Remke will take a position as the presiding administrative law judge for appellate operations for the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board.\nDan Schnur, who once was an FPPC chair, told the Bee that Remke’s resignation will contribute to the marginalization of the watchdog’s role “in the eyes of the political community."\n"Stepping aside in the last days before an election is in keeping with a very minimalist approach to the job that she’s displayed ever since she was first named chair," Schnur said.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

Families and experts are pressing for President Trump to bring up the heartbreaking question during a summit with Kim Jong Un that may now be back on again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has secured the remains of hundreds of Americans from North Korea over the years, and President Trump was expected to push Kim to allow the U.S. to secure even more before he canceled the summit.\nHowever, for the families of American captives who reportedly survived, or whose fates are still unknown, that was never enough - and they hope that any potential summit will come with a demand for answers about their loved ones after all these years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapt. Harry C. Moore\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(U.S. Air Force)\n\n\n\nBob and Lois Moore are one such family. Bob\'s brother, Captain Harry C. Moore, was a fighter pilot with the U.S. Air Force who was shot down off the coast of Korea in 1951. It was the second time Moore had been shot down while serving the U.S., having survived more than 50 days in the wilderness after being shot down over China in 1944.\nHe wasn\'t so lucky the second time around. Moore\'s wife, Lois, learned on New Year\'s Eve less than two years later that her husband was believed to have been killed in action. The shared grief between Lois and Harry\'s brother, Bob, would lead them to later marry. They say they still think about him every day. But Moore\'s story was far from over.\nIn 2002, the Moores received word from government officials saying they now believed – after some 50 years – that it was possible Harry survived his ordeal. Unearthed testimonies from former Soviet officials revealed that Harry might have been captured and interrogated by the Soviets after being shot down, though his fate afterwards remained unknown.\n\n\n\n"Immediately we started trying to find out what actually happened," Bob said. Nearly two decades after receiving that memo, and more than 65 years after his brother\'s plane was shot down, Bob and Lois say they still haven\'t received any other information from the government – though they’ve learned plenty themselves. And that\'s why they\'re taking matters into their own hands.\nSUING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ANSWERS\n"We\'re the only ones I think that ever had the gall to sue the FBI and the CIA, but hell - we\'d sue President Trump if we had to," Bob Moore told Fox News. "We do it on behalf of all the families," Moore said. "There are nearly 8,000 still missing from recent wars that haven\'t been accounted for."\nStatistics compiled by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) indicate some 7,702 Americans remain missing from the Korean War as of May 18, 2018. Families like the Moores receive regular updates on the government\'s efforts to learn more.\n\n"We\'re the only ones I think that ever had the gall to sue the FBI and the CIA, but hell - we\'d sue President Trump if we had to... We do it on behalf of all the families [like ours]... There are nearly 8,000 still missing from recent wars that haven\'t been accounted for."\n- Bob Moore, brother of Air Force Captain Harry Moore (MIA)\n\nMoore says those letters, called the "Family Update," tell the same story every time, and notes that his family has spent time chasing down leads themselves. Just this month, their daughter traveled to South Korea to meet with North Korean defectors, who unfortunately provided little in the way of new information on Harry.\nThe Moores say the government is ignoring evidence uncovered in the past that indicates Harry was likely captured alive, and used as an instructor for pilots in the Soviet Air Force. That\'s according to an American analyst the Moores met with in Washington, and who apparently interviewed the Russian pilots who shot down Harry\'s plane.\nAccording to the Moores, that analyst told them that both pilots mentioned remembering a “Gary” or “Harry Moore” specifically by name, and without any prompting from him.\nIt was the testimony of one of those same pilots, the Moores say, that inspired the government to update Harry\'s status in 2002. Since that time, Bob Moore says the government has thrown cold water on that testimony – suggesting it is insufficient to prove anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nA man watches a TV screen showing file images of U.S. President Donald Trump, left, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, during a news program at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, March 27, 2018. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)\n\n\n\n"What we\'re saying is we\'re never going to get the information from the government unless we can force them to open classified files they\'ve had for 60 years," Moore says of the lawsuit he has filed. "It\'s unfair to let someone give their life and then be totally ignored," he added.\nEXPERTS SAY U.S. HAS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE, JUST NOT DIGGING\nMark Sauter is a long-time North Korea watcher who is helping the Moores in their quest. He told Fox News that "just last year, we were able to have records from 1954 declassified; they revealed a secret U.S. intelligence mission to insert agents into North Korea to look for US POWs a year after all the POWs were supposed to have been returned.\n"What all the more recent, still classified records show we can only imagine," Sauter added.\nSauter notes there have been plenty of documented cases of Americans known to be alive after their capture in North Korea, like the group known as the Ashley Five – who were even the subject of failed rescue attempts by the U.S. government.\n\n"We believe that U.S. Korean War POWs were transferred to the Soviet Union and never repatriated. This transfer was a highly-secret MGB [KGB] program approved by the inner circle of the Stalinist dictatorship."\n- 1993 Dept. of Defense report on "The Transfer of U.S. Korean War POWs To the Soviet Union"\n\nSauter also points to the case of Major Sam Logan, who was filmed in North Korean custody in a piece of video footage circulated by the Soviet Union at the end of the Korean War. Logan hasn’t been heard from since.\nNorm Kass spent 30 years at the DoD, and for 20 of those years he was working on the presidentially mandated U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs. He says "there was a definite link between things [he] was involved in and various reports the U.S. government obtained alleging American servicemen had been held by the North Koreans."\nKass points to a 1993 report, titled "The Transfer of U.S. Korean War POWs To the Soviet Union," as proof of just how much the U.S. government knows about this issue. The report was compiled by the Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO), now known as the aforementioned DPAA. In it, U.S. government officials alleged "that US Korean War POWs were transferred to the Soviet Union and never repatriated” as part of “a highly-secret MGB [KGB] program approved by the inner circle of the Stalinist dictatorship…\n“The range of eyewitness testimony as to the presence of U.S. Korean War POWS in the GULAG is so broad and convincing that we cannot dismiss it,” researchers concluded.\nKass points out that there is no specific number of American captives outlined in that report, and to this day he devotes much of his time to tracking down tracking down missing Americans around the world with the POW Investigative Project. Still, he suggests there has been plenty of other evidence indicating U.S. POWs captured during the Korean War wound up being shipped to various parts of the world.\nDuring his time working with the DoD, which included deployments to remote parts of Russia for weeks at the time, Kass uncovered radio broadcasts from eastern European countries where American servicemen who had been captured alive were mentioned by name. Other reports he was privy to outlined instances of American servicemen seen being marched through the streets of the Soviet Union at the time of the Korean War.\nThe problem is corroborating many of these reports, something Kass says Russian authorities have never been willing to do. However, he added that they\'re not the only ones to blame for the lack of answers more than half a century later.\n\n\n\n\n\nA POW/MIA flag flies Friday, Sept. 20, 2013, in Olympia, Wash., on National POW/MIA Recognition Day. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\n\n\n"This is a story, a phenomenon that has many dimensions to it," Kass says, "and the U.S. government, frankly, I don\'t think devoted the kind of due diligence needed to get to the bottom of it."\nHOPE IN “THE TRUMP APPROACH”\nThat said, Kass believes there is still hope, and a summit between these two particular leaders could be the key to answering lingering questions from families like the Moores. He notes it would also send a strong message to those who are currently serving in uniform today.\n\n"This is a story, a phenomenon that has many dimensions to it, and the U.S. government, frankly, I don\'t think devoted the kind of due diligence needed to get to the bottom of it."\n- Norm Kass, 30-year DoD official who specialized in Soviet Union & POW/MIA issues\n\n"For someone now in uniform, I think the morale boost that would come from the administration stepping in and saying that \'we are working seriously to try to resolve these questions\' would be an enormously positive factor," Kass says. "It\'s showing that the government is not turning its back on anyone."\nThe "Trump approach," as Kass calls it, could be "a true blessing here, because if this is going to be effective it has to be handled quietly.\nStill, he says President Trump should make it clear that "it\'s not just about bringing back body parts. It\'s finding out what happened to these people."\nAnd while Kass says he isn\'t sure what the U.S. could offer in return, he thinks "the idea that Kim and the president could speak out of earshot of all the microphones, and put something like this in place, that seems - just from the style of these two leaders - like something that is eminently doable."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Jerry Brown’s desk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California State Assembly last week passed a measure that would expand a current program, introduced in 2015 by Brown, which provided Medi-Cal coverage for undocumented minors under the age of 19. The new legislation, introduced by Democratic State Assemblymember Dr. Joaquin Arambula, expands that program to cover undocumented young adults up to age 26.\n“The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions,” the Assembly bill read. “The federal Medicaid program prohibits payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law.”\n\nArambula’s bill was initially slated to cover all undocumented adults, but was amended to expand coverage to just young adults under 26 years of age. That bill is expected to be considered in the California State Senate.\n“This bill would extend eligibility for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals who are under 26 years of age and who are otherwise eligible for those benefits but for their immigration status,” the bill reads.\nA spokesperson for Brown directed Fox News to Arambula’s office for comment.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nHealth insurance for illegal immigrants in California?\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, California state Sen. Ricardo Lara introduced similar legislation. This bill would cover undocumented minors up to the age of 19, and would expand the program to cover undocumented adults 65 years and older. Lara’s bill also was originally written to cover all undocumented adults, but was amended in Senate appropriations, according to a California state legislature source.\nAn aide in Arambula’s office told Fox News that the assemblymember’s bill was separate from Lara’s, but that both technically can pass and reach the governor’s desk.\n“We are trying to address the fact that, whether you like it or not, our undocumented community needs the care, and we are paying for it anyway,” Lara told Politico.\nA spokesperson for Lara did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.\nIf the bills pass, California could become the first state in the nation to offer health insurance coverage to illegal immigrants, beyond the current policy.\nThe California Legislative Analyst’s Office told Modern Healthcare that offering full-cost healthcare coverage would cost the state $3 billon for the 2018-2019 year. When the legislation was introduced last year, the state was expected to spend $1 billion a year to provide healthcare to illegal immigrants.\n“This is just more bad policy coming out of California. They make it more and more accommodating for illegal aliens and more and more middle class families are picking up and leaving California,” Federation for American Immigration Reform spokesman Ira Mehlman told Fox News.\n “The best way to deal with illegal immigration is not to worry about or figure out how to pay for needs like healthcare, but to discourage people from breaking the law and bringing their kids here in the first place.”\nMehlman added: “California’s position seems to be that they’re going to continue to encourage people to come illegally and dream up new programs to encourage people, to the detriment of everyone else in California.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

We will leave the shadowboxing to others.\xa0\nOur interest is in how matters will affect the fall elections and the 2020 contests thereafter. With that in mind, let’s batch through some of the news that has been breaking on this front.\xa0  -\xa0President Trump\xa0is limbering up his pardon pen. Trump raised eyebrows last summer with his pardon of a former Arizona sheriff who was facing contempt charges for refusing to comply with court orders. The sheriff, though, had been a stalwart for Trump during not just the 2016 campaign but also during Trump’s effort to convince Americans that then-President Obama\xa0was a secret Kenyan and usurper of the Oval Office. Now, Trump is preparing to pardon\xa0Dinesh D’Souza, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud in a New York Senate election. D’Souza, for the uninitiated, is an all-star Twitter troll with a robust following among the\xa0Rosanne Barr\xa0set. Trump is also said to be considering pardons for the ultra-corrupt former governor of Illinois,\xa0Rod Blagojevich, and lifestyle guru\xa0Martha Stewart. While Stewart’s case is rather different in that she may really have been steamrolled, what ties the three together is that in each instance, the potential recipients blame figures common to the probe into potential wrongdoing in Trump’s campaign, particularly\xa0James Comey. This is probably just setting the table for what we expect to be the pardons of Trump intimates now or potentially facing federal charges.\xa0\n\n-\xa0Do you know any of those people who just send you email calendar invites to meetings you haven’t agreed to? This is kind of the approach that Trump’s lawyer\xa0Rudy Giuliani\xa0is taking with Special Counsel\xa0Robert Mueller. Mueller can’t close his investigation until he interviews the president, but Giuliani says that can’t happen until late June at the earliest because Trump is too busy preparing for a potential summit with North Korean dictator\xa0Kim Jong Un\xa0to get ready to meet with Mueller. Giuliani also says that Mueller told him that if the interview happens soon that the whole investigation can be concluded by\xa0Sept. 1, an assertion that Mueller’s team hasn’t knocked down. Now, Giuliani says that the matter\xa0must\xa0conclude by\xa0Sept. 1\xa0or it will amount to prosecutorial interference with the midterm elections in the same way that former FBI Director\xa0James Comey\xa0helped tank\xa0Hillary Clinton’s bid with an October surprise about her emails that turned out to be a fizzle. Oh yeah, Giuliani also says Trump won’t talk to Mueller until the prosecutor turns over\xa0everything\xa0in his case file for review. But other than that, he’s ready to get ‘er done…\n-\xa0The Trump team continues to read out of the Clinton playbook for dealing with the Mueller investigation. One of the key strategies is to enforce strict partisan discipline. Witness the comments from Rep.\xa0Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who sought to reassure Americans that the FBI had not become the Stasi as Trump’s frothiest defenders claim. Team Trump is coming hard after Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, for “drinking the Kool Aid” and suggesting that he was soft on Hillary Clinton in his interrogation over her role in the Benghazi debacle. Some of the president’s defenders are even suggesting Gowdy is a liar because the key documents may not have been present at a briefing. What makes it all so funny is that Gowdy has been the one having to hold the hand of Mueller foe Intelligence Committee Chairman\xa0Devin Nunes, who apparently doesn’t want to or isn’t able to read certain classified documents. It’s important for Team Trump to keep supporters focused on their enemies – Obama, Clinton, Comey – but even more important to punish members of the tribe who dissent from the party line.\xa0\xa0\n-\xa0Do you remember when Republicans used to complain so loudly about the way then-President Obama\xa0reflexively blamed his predecessor,\xa0George W. Bush? As\xa0Fred Barnes\xa0rightly observed\xa0in May 2009 “True, presidents have blamed the prior administration for problems they inherit,\xa0but I can\'t think of a president who did so as aggressively and with such moral preening as Obama.” Fred was right. It was unbecoming, unhelpful and divisive. So what are we to think about an administration even more obsessed with its predecessor? Imagine if Obama had opened new investigations into the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the handling of Hurricane Katrina or the Panic of 2008. All would have been merited by facts, supported by facts in evidence and enormously pleasing to Obama’s base.\n\n\n\n-\xa0If\xa0President Trump\xa0doesn’t feel like he can get away with firing Attorney General\xa0Jeff Sessions\xa0why doesn’t he leave the poor guy alone? Trump insiders say in piece after piece about the president’s abuse of his top cop that firing Sessions is impossible because it would bring “political consequences.” Now, we will allow that in the current climate it would be hard to get an attorney general nominee through the Senate. To get someone through, the nominee would have to show sufficient independence and skepticism to be confirmed that he or she would offer no relief to a president who seems to want an umpire who calls them for the home team. So we ask you quite sincerely: Is there some point to the\xa0ongoing humiliations\xa0of Sessions? The AG has made it clear that he’s not going to be bullied out, so why not leave him be? After all, Sessions continues to score policy victories for the administration. We hope that there’s some purpose here – even a cynical one – because otherwise it’s just pure sadism.\n -\xa0Each Thursday we pass along the columns of our friend Judge\xa0Andrew Napolitano. We know that some of you chafe at his libertarianism, but also know how much you appreciate his faithful reading of law, devotion to Madisonian precepts and willingness to tell the truth even when it goes against his own stated interests. We would suggest that\xa0this week’s installment\xa0of what we call “The Judge’s Ruling” is particularly useful for Republicans trying to separate their feelings from facts as it relates to the Mueller probe:\xa0“If [Trump and Giuliani] are successful, they will have assaulted the rule of law by persuading the public to accept innuendo and known untruths. … Giuliani\'s job is not to be Trump\'s lawyer; rather, it is to effect public sentiment. For the government, as Abraham Lincoln once said, with public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed. Trump and Giuliani understand that better than they understand the rule of law.”\nTHE RULEBOOK: HE TOLD US  “I am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 1  TIME OUT:\xa0BRING ON THE DUBBLE BUBBLE New Yorker: “For too long, we have asked one another, typically as an insult, ‘Can you chew gum and walk at the same time?’ A better question might be, ‘Why aren’t you chewing gum and walking right now?’ That’s the apparent takeaway of a study that was presented this week at the European Congress on Obesity, in Vienna, Austria, and which appears in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science. The researchers, led by the sports scientist Yuka Hamada, of Waseda University, in Japan, found that people who chew gum while walking expend more energy than non-chewing walkers. … The authors noted that, if you did nothing but chew gum all day for a year, you could lose eleven pounds. ‘Its potential effect on energy balance should not be discounted,’ they wrote. … Unlike most gum-chewing studies, Hamada’s looked at people in motion rather than at rest. … They conclude that ‘gum chewing during walking may increase the physical and physiological functions of middle-aged and elderly male participants in particular.’”  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.

In a survey of 625 registered Republican voters likely to cast their ballots in the election, 45 percent said they would vote for Kristi Noem if the race were held today. Forty-four percent, meanwhile, said they\'d vote for Marty Jackley. Another 11 percent said they were undecided. Jacksonville, Florida-based Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy polled voters by telephone between May 21 and May 23. The margin of error is 4.5 percentage points. The numbers illustrate what those closely watching the race have known for a while: it\'s close. And with one week until the primary, candidates have a tight window to win over voters still on the fence or steal support from their competitor. Both campaigns seemed keenly aware of the tight nature of the race. In the days ahead of the primary, they took digs at one another in interviews with the Argus Leader and in television and radio ads that began airing over the weekend.”  No special Senate election in Arizona this year -\xa0KNXV: “A key deadline quietly passed overnight, with huge political implications in Arizona and across the country. Senator\xa0John McCain’s seat will officially not be up for grabs this November. That deadline passed at midnight and it’s important for several reasons, especially for Republicans who are fighting to keep control in the Senate in the upcoming November mid-terms.\xa0Sen. McCain is battling brain cancer\xa0and hasn’t returned to Washington in months. Arizona Governor\xa0Doug Ducey’s office confirmed that he and First Lady\xa0Angela Ducey\xa0met with the McCains near Sedona on Tuesday. Since the midnight deadline passed, Ducey\xa0would appoint someone to McCain’s seat should he step down.\xa0…\xa0Should the senator decide to step down now, some of the names being talked about to replace him are his wife,\xa0Cindy McCain, but also former Attorney General\xa0Grant Woods\xa0and former Senator\xa0Jon Kyl.”  All eyes on Montana Senate primary - Roll Call: “The next big Republican Senate primary is in Montana, where voters will choose Democratic Sen. Jon Tester’s opponent on Tuesday. The GOP contest in Big Sky Country was a sleepy affair for much of this year, lacking the verbal ax throwing that animated similar contests in Indiana and West Virginia this spring. ‘It kinda starts late in Montana, it always does,’ said a GOP strategist who works in the state. Not to mention that voters there went through a grueling gubernatorial race in 2016, shortly followed by an expensive special election for the at-large House seat. ‘Some people just don’t want to pay attention,’ the strategist added. More than 130,000 people had voted early as of Tuesday night, and with the June 5 primary inching closer, outside groups have increasingly been saturating the airwaves and candidates have been scrambling to differentiate themselves.”  Trump endorses Dan Donovan in NY-11 House race - WashEx: “President Trump is backing Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., in the primary race for New York’s 11 Congressional District against Michael Grimm, who is running to win his seat back after stepping down in 2015. ‘There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again,’ Trump tweeted Wednesday evening. … Donovan did not vote for the GOP\'s tax reform measure that passed in December, citing that the ‘bill that came out of the conference committee still means a tax increase for many Staten Island and Brooklyn residents.’ Earlier this month, Donovan released an ad where he touted how he was working to advance Trump’s agenda.”  Gubernatorial candidate in Md. fights to correct ballots after sudden death of running mate - Baltimore Sun: “Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Valerie Ervin has filed a lawsuit seeking to force state officials to reprint primary elections ballots with her name on them. In a filing in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court, Ervin and her running mate, Marisol Johnson, argue that not printing new ballots ‘will cause confusion and cause voters to reassess who to vote for since their candidate does not appear properly on the ballot.’ Ervin had been the lieutenant governor running mate for Kevin Kamenetz, who was a leading Democratic contender for governor. After Kamenetz died of a sudden cardiac arrest on May 10, Ervin decided to take his place at the top of the ticket, as state law allows. She picked Johnson, a former Baltimore County school board member, to be her running mate.”  New Mexico gubernatorial candidate made profit off state insurance plan - Politico: “Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the leading Democratic candidate for governor in New Mexico, profited from the state’s use of a high-priced health-insurance program for seriously ill patients, even after Obamacare made such programs virtually obsolete. As most states were shuttering their subsidized health-insurance programs for people with pre-existing conditions because they could get coverage through Obamacare, a firm co-founded by Lujan Grisham and a close political ally received millions of dollars to run New Mexico’s program, even as she served in Congress. The state’s high risk pool is still open even though its premiums are higher on average than Obamacare — 10 percent higher this year — and while all but nine of the 35 states that once had such programs either shut them down or cut off new enrollment.”  Trump in Texas for shooting victims and campaign donors - Dallas Morning News: “President Donald Trump arrived Thursday in Houston and met privately with relatives of students killed at Santa Fe High School two weeks ago, before rubbing elbows with high dollar donors in Houston and Dallas. The trip was scheduled before the May 18 school rampage that left 10 people dead. The president will raise campaign funds for Senate Republicans at a luncheon in Houston before heading to Dallas for a high-dollar dinner to benefit the national party and his own 2020 reelection effort. … Donors in Dallas will pay at least a $2,700-per-person for a reception at the Adolphus Hotel downtown. VIP tickets for dinner cost $50,000 and include a photo with the president.”  TRUMP ADMIN PLANS TO PROCEED WITH TARIFFS  WSJ: “The Trump administration, unable to win concessions from European Union counterparts ahead of a Friday deadline, is planning to make good on its threat to impose tariffs on European steel and aluminum, people familiar with the matter said. The administration is expected to make an announcement as early as Thursday. The move, which has been threatened for months, is almost certain to draw a response from the EU, which has threatened to retaliate with its own tariffs on such American products as motorcycles, jeans and bourbon. President Donald Trump announced in March global tariffs of 25% on imported steel, and 10% on aluminum, based on national security concerns. The White House delayed implementation for some countries, giving those trading partners a chance to offer concessions to avoid the tariffs. The U.S. is now planning to let the EU’s exemption lapse. One person familiar with the matter said the administration’s plans could still change, particularly if the two sides are able to cobble together a last-minute deal, though both sides suggest such a deal is unlikely.”  Mexico to impose tariffs right back at the U.S. - The Hill: “The government of Mexico announced on Thursday it would implement new duties on various U.S. products in response to President Trump\'s decision to levy steel and aluminum tariffs on the country. ‘Mexico reiterates its position against protectionist measures that affect and distort international commerce in goods,’ the government said in a statement. ‘In response to the tariffs imposed by the United States, Mexico will impose equivalent measures to various products like flat steels (hot and cold foil, including coated and various tubes), lamps, legs and shoulders of pork, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, blueberries, various cheeses, among others, up to an amount comparable to the level of affectation.’”  Beijing official warns China would retaliate against US trade crackdown - Fox News: “China reserves the right to retaliate if U.S. trade measures against it violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, the Chinese commerce ministry said Thursday. Gao Feng, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesman, said a White House proposal to limit Chinese investment in the U.S. would violate the ‘rules and basic spirit’ of the WTO. ‘The Chinese side will carefully evaluate the U.S. measures and reserves the right to take corresponding measures,’ Gao said. China believes the two countries have a huge potential for cooperation and does not want to see an escalation of Sino-U.S. trade frictions, Gao told reporters at a regular news briefing, Reuters reported.”  PLAY-BY-PLAY Boehner: ‘The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere’ - NBC News  White House to launch opioid ad push next week - Axios  McConnell’s reign in the Senate will soon be record-breaking - Politico  Congress mulls lowering age requirement for truck drivers to prevent national shortage - Fox News  Trump’s net worth at the lowest since campaign - Bloomberg  AUDIBLE: IT ME  “Why would you need a Republican wannabe if you can have the Republican?” – Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., referring to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D. There have been growing concerns that Heitkamp’s cordial relationship with the president could be trouble for Cramer’s Senate hopes.   FROM THE BLEACHERS “Chris, I look forward to the rationality of the Halftime Report each day. I’m currently reading Lynne Cheney’s biography of Madison – a good reminder that politics in America has always been rough and tumble and apropos for today’s events. Andrew Jackson killed my distant cousin Charles Henry Dickenson – note the spelling difference. The Dickensons arrived in America through Georgia when it was a penal colony. They were horse thieves in England. The American branch of the family had a problem with alcohol, which along with an inability to pay the bet when Jackson’s horse won led to Cousin Charlie’s demise.” – Chuck Gibson, Lakeland, Fla.  [Ed. note: The old saying is that a family’s interest in genealogy ends when they find the first horse thief.

A STORY YOU’LL RELISH\xa0 BBC: “It’s the wurst thing that can happen to a sausage dog - ending up looking more like a meatball.\xa0The four-year-old pet, named\xa0Trevor, went from wiener to whopper when a hole in its windpipe left air trapped under its skin in a rare condition. Vets soon had the distended dachshund back to its saveloy-like self after a minor operation to ‘deflate’ it from more than twice its normal size. ‘He’d blown up like a balloon,’ said owner\xa0Fran Jennings. … Tests were carried out and the dog was diagnosed with sub-cutaneous emphysema, an abnormal collection of air under the skin. … Ms. Jennings’ daughter\xa0Jessica, who shows sausage dogs at Crufts, added: ‘He looked like a big fat seal. His whole body was like a blob…. But now he’s back to his normal self, chasing the chickens and we wouldn’t have him any other way.’”  Chris Stirewalt\xa0is the politics editor for Fox News.\xa0Brianna McClelland\xa0contributed to this report.

The final memo by the deputy attorney general didn’t mention Russia and instead focused on the Clinton email case.\nRosenstein appointed Mueller just a week after Comey was fired from his role. The job fell to Rosenstein because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the case because of his advisory role in Trump\'s campaign.\nMcCabe is known to have kept personal notes on his interactions with Trump, some of which included what Comey told him about his encounters with the president, Fox News reported. He turned over the memos to Mueller.\nTrump criticized the documents, saying in March that he never saw McCabe take notes about their conversations, suggesting the memos should be called “fake memos.”\n“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?” Trump tweeted.\n\nSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2018\n\n\nMcCabe was fired in March, just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension, amid a report by an inspector general, claiming he misled internal investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of Clinton’s email server and leaked a self-serving story to the media.\nSessions, who authorized the McCabe firing, said at the time that McCabe “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.”\nDOJ IG RELEASES EXPLOSIVE REPORT THAT LED TO FIRING OF EX-FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE\nInspector General Michael Horowitz, who also penned the damning report, determined that McCabe authorized the leak yet later told the investigators that he did authorize the disclosure and did not know who was responsible.\n“[W]e concluded that McCabe’s decision to confirm the existence of the CF investigation through an anonymously sourced quote, recounting the content of a phone call with a senior department official in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of department leadership, was clearly not within the public interest exception," the report said.\nFox News’ Adam Shaw, Brooke Singman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday, hitting the team with the same accusation leveled at the Russians in the 2016 race.\xa0\n\nThe 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nMinutes later, he added: “Why aren’t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It’s a Rigged Witch Hunt, that’s why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!”\n\nWhy aren’t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It’s a Rigged Witch Hunt, that’s why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nThe president was referring to the 13 investigators -- of the 17 total members on Mueller’s team -- who have registered as Democrats. At least nine have donated to Democratic candidates and causes. Mueller, though, is said to be a lifelong Republican and served as FBI director under former Republican President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nOne of the registered Democrats on the team, Andrew Weissmann, reportedly attended Hillary Clinton’s election-night party at the Javits Center in New York City.\nThe president has repeatedly blasted Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt,” and has vowed all along that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election -- a central focus of the probe.\nHe and his legal team have ramped up criticism of the probe in recent weeks, with Trump now casting it as a distraction from big issues like pending diplomatic talks with North Korea.\xa0\n“Sorry, I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\xa0\n\nSorry, I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nThe president has been emboldened by revelations that an FBI informant was communicating with members of the Trump campaign. The issue is now being examined by the Justice Department inspector general.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Obama-era intelligence officials, like former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey, have defended the intelligence community’s use of an informant, or “Confidential Human Source.”\xa0\nAnd after a high-level briefing last week with lawmakers, Democrats maintained they had seen no evidence "to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a ‘spy’ in the Trump Campaign."\xa0\nBut the president has dubbed the controversy “SPYGATE,” following revelations that the informant had communicated with at least three members of the campaign—George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and Sam Clovis.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!” Trump tweeted early Thursday.\n\nIger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018\n\n\nThe president’s comments follow the network’s cancellation of Roseanne Barr’s comeback revival of “Roseanne,” over her racist tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.\n\nThe president on Wednesday first put the heat on Disney CEO Bob Iger by contrasting his handling of Barr with Disney and ABC\'s treatment of his administration. (ABC is owned by Disney.)\n“Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‘ABC does not tolerate comments like those’ made by Roseanne Barr,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?”\nBarr lost her show after describing Jarrett as like “the muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.” Jarrett later said Iger had called her before the network cancelled the show.\n\n\n\n“He apologized,” Jarrett said during an MSNBC appearance. “He said he had zero tolerance for that sort of racist, bigoted comment and he wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling his show and so I appreciate that they did that so swiftly.”\nThe president on Thursday, though, contrasted that against the handling of ABC\'s Brian Ross, who was suspended for four weeks in 2017 without pay following a botched “exclusive” about former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. He has since returned to air.\xa0\nABC News did, however, apologize -- just not to Trump directly.\n“We deeply regret and apologize for the serious error we made yesterday,” an ABC News statement read at the time. “The reporting conveyed by Brian Ross during the special report had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process. As a result of our continued reporting over the next several hours ultimately we determined the information was wrong and we corrected the mistake on air and online.”\xa0\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Trump also wants to know why Iger hasn’t apologized for the “horrible things” said by anti-Trump personalities like Keith Olbermann, Jemele Hill, Joy Behar and Kathy Griffin.\nFox News\' Alex Pappas and Brian Flood contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2018\n\n\nTrump appears increasingly frustrated that the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller has continued for more than a year, putting a cloud over his presidency. The investigation is focusing on whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the race.\n\nTrump didn’t mention any specific names regarding whose lives might have been destroyed. However, several people have left the administration amid the investigation, including 29-year-old Hope Hicks, who was a member of the 2016 campaign and ascended to be the White House communications director.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

John Conyers\' son to be included on the Democratic primary ballot for the 13th Congressional District seat has been rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Detroit News reports that a judge on Tuesday denied John Conyers III\'s request.\nWayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett said last month that Conyers III didn\'t have enough signatures to make it on the Aug. 7 ballot to fill out the final two months of his father\'s term or for the full term that starts in January.\n\nThe younger Conyers challenged Garrett\'s ruling in court.\nHis father was first elected in 1964.

The former Democratic Party nominee considered the question Friday at Harvard University and said she would like to run Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring an event at which she received the prestigious Radcliffe Medal for “transformative impact on society,” Clinton was asked which company she would like to lead as CEO.\nWithout any hesitation, Clinton named Facebook, noting that the social media giant has vast power and controls the flow of information.\n\n\nHillary Clinton willing to swap politics to be CEO of #Facebook. Should Zuck be worried?  🦄😅 pic.twitter.com/skOBhn0tFw— Larry Kim (@larrykim) May 29, 2018\n\n\n“It’s the biggest news platform in the world … but most people in our country get their news, true or not, from Facebook,” she said.\nThe response drew mixed reactions on social media, though the attempt to put her name on the table may not be so out of the ordinary. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg openly endorsed Clinton’s candidacy while a co-founder of the social media giant, Dustin Moskovitz, led a nearly $30 million effort to defeat now-President Donald Trump.\nOther Facebook employees contributed more money to Clinton\'s campaign -- some $114,000 -- than to those of any other candidate, according to Federal Election Commission data that takes into account only donations over $200, the Hill reported.\n\n\n\nBut the former U.S. secretary of state’s openness to run Facebook came at the time when the tech company is coping with a number of scandals, including alleged misuse of user data that allowed political campaigns, including possibly Clinton’s, to target potential voters after acquiring the data of millions of people.\nJust this week, Facebook was accused of deceptive tactics to pressure people to accept its privacy policy. According to a complaint filed by the European Center for Digital Rights on behalf of an anonymous individual, the platform blocked users who didn’t consent to the new privacy policies and used “tricks” – including fake message notifications – to pressure them into agreeing with the policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“[Facebook] used additional ‘tricks’ to pressure the users: For example, the consent page included two fake red dots … that indicated that the user has new messages and notifications, which he/she cannot access without consenting — even if the user did not have such notifications or messages in reality,” the complaint reads, according to Australia\'s\xa0News.co.au.\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN APP MAY HAVE HARVESTED FACEBOOK DATA OF MILLIONS\nBut similar to Cambridge Analytica, the company that was forced to shut down amid the data misuse scandal, the Clinton campaign itself may have harvested the data of potentially millions of users to get an edge over Trump.\nIn the midst of the election, Clinton\'s campaign launched a mobile application called “Hillary 2016” that allowed every user to pair their friends list on Facebook with their phone contacts – and give the campaign permission to access that info.\nPeople who didn’t download the application - or weren’t even Clinton supporters – weren’t given an option to prohibit their Facebook friends from pairing their phone numbers with Facebook accounts and indicate their likelihood of voting for the Democratic candidate.\n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

The plaintiffs varied from professors to a police officer in Texas.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed after Trump blocked users from @realDonaldTrump, a 9-year-old Twitter account with over 50 million followers. Each of the plaintiffs tweeted a message critical of Trump or his policies in reply to a tweet he sent.\nAfter a hearing, the judge had suggested that Trump mute rather than block some of his critics. At the time, a Justice Department attorney agreed that muting would enable Trump to avoid a tweet he doesn’t want to read.\n\nWe whined. We complained. We sued. We won our First Amendment lawsuit in federal court. And now @realDonaldTrump has unblocked me. Wow! pic.twitter.com/eseRSJG5ah— Philip N Cohen (@familyunequal) June 5, 2018\n\n\nJameel Jaffer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Reuters that Trump’s Twitter handle on Monday unblocked his seven plaintiffs. The White House did not immediately respond to the report. The Justice Department confirmed that the plaintiffs had been unblocked.\n\n\n\nTwitter users can block people, which prevents them from seeing the user’s feed while logged in. Or they can mute the person, which keeps the user from seeing that person’s tweets and reply messages in their feed.\nPhilip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, reportedly tweeted, “We whined. We complained. We sued. We won our First Amendment lawsuit in federal court. And now @realDonaldTrump has unblocked me.

Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota calls the unanimous vote "an incredibly important moment."\n\nShe says bill crafted with Sen.

He placed $58,100 into three clearly marked envelopes, then packed the money away in his carry-on luggage.\xa0\n\nIt was 13 years of his life savings – and the federal government took every penny.\nTSA employees discovered the cash, and agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized it. But first they strip-searched Kazazi and interrogated the 64-year-old without a translator as he covered himself with a towel.\nThat was in October. Kazazi still hasn’t been convicted (or charged) of any crime, and CBP didn’t offer any explanation for a month. But thanks to a law enforcement procedure called civil asset forfeiture, CBP also hasn’t given Kazazi his savings back. The federal government then came up with an explanation: they\xa0suspected\xa0he was “involved in a smuggling/drug trafficking/money laundering operation.”\xa0\n\n\n\nThe large sum wasn’t for anything nefarious, explained Kazazi, a former Albanian police office. “The crime in Albania is much worse than it is here,” he told\xa0the Washington Post.\xa0“Other people that have made large withdrawals [from Albanian banks] have had people intercept them and take their money.” Plus, hard U.S. currency is worth more.\nAnd because traveling with that kind of cash isn’t a crime, the Kazazi family has filed suit against the federal government.\xa0\nClick for more from The Washington Examiner.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Antonio Villaraigosa cheated on his wife with a reporter assigned to cover him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the #MeToo movement, which has urged women to speak up about sexual misconduct allegations, has remained visibly silent about the sexual conduct of two prominent Democrats running for governor in California.\nSome are calling it outright hypocrisy. Critics say the two abused their power and took advantage of vulnerable women – not unlike the allegations taking down powerful men all across the country.\n\nAmanda Renteria, a Democrat also running for governor, is calling on Newsom, the clear frontrunner of the race, to step aside.\n“I think elected officials need to be held to higher standard,” Renteria said. “And no matter who it is or where it is, we need to make sure we elect people who do not abuse their power in any way.”\nFOX NEWS MIDTERMS 2018 AMERICA\'S ELECTION HQ\n\n\n\nSome supporters of the #MeToo movement, however, are giving Newsom a pass.\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who has said sexual harassment is inappropriate “in every circumstance in every way,” endorsed Newsom. Comedian Chelsea Handler, a vocal supporter of the movement, helped him raise $17 million from Silicon Valley and Hollywood donors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, when  Gavin Newsom was in his first term as San Francisco mayor, he admitted to having an affair with his appointment secretary, who was the wife of his campaign adviser and friend.  "I want to make it clear that everything you\'ve heard and read is true, and I\'m deeply sorry about that," Newsom said at the time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(The Associated Press)\n\n\n\nDemocrats, instead, are blasting Renteria for calling out Newsom – saying she’s “degrading” the movement to score political points.\n“#MeToo is about ownership of our experiences because we all have stories that are ours alone to tell,” Shawnda Westly, the California Democratic Party’s former executive director, told BuzzFeed News. “Instead, Amanda has chosen to degrade the movement for her own political purposes by manipulating someone else’s story for her gain.”\nIn 2007, when Newsom was in his first term as San Francisco mayor, he admitted to having an affair with his appointment secretary, who was the wife of his campaign adviser and friend.\n"I want to make it clear that everything you\'ve heard and read is true, and I\'m deeply sorry about that," Newsom said at the time. "I\'ve hurt someone I care deeply about – Alex Tourk, and his friends and family. And that is something I have to live with."\nYet, the affair has barely been mentioned in the race.\nBACKED BY TRUMP, REPUBLICAN JOHN COX IS A FORCE IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR RACE\nThe woman with whom he had an affair, Ruby Rippey Gibney, has defended Newsom, saying his behavior does not rise to the level of discussion in the movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntonio Villaraigosa admitted to having an affair with a TV reporter who covered him while he was the mayor of Los Angeles. Soon afterward, he announced he and his wife of 20 years were splitting up. Yet, he too enjoys broad Democratic support.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\n"I fully support the #metoo movement. In this particular instance, however, I am doubtful that it applies," she wrote on her Facebook page, according to the Los Angeles Times. "Yes, I was a subordinate, but I was also a free-thinking, 33-yr old adult married woman & mother. (I also happened to have an unfortunate inclination towards drinking-to-excess & self-destruction.)"\nIn 2007, Villaraigosa admitted to having an affair with a TV reporter who covered him while he was the mayor of Los Angeles. Soon afterward, he announced he and his wife of 20 years were splitting up. Yet, he too enjoys broad Democratic support.\nVeteran columnist Dan Walters said because both affairs were consensual, the media, liberal donors and many Democrats are looking the other way.\n“It is just not that big a deal anymore,” Walters said. “This isn\'t Kansas, this isn’t Georgia or Alabama – this is California, and we take a pretty tolerant view of people\'s foibles.”\nRenteria, however, sees a double standard, especially among progressives who call out sexual misconduct in others.\n“This pattern of misconduct is completely unacceptable,” she said of Newsom, according to the Medium. “From Washington to California, citizens have begun calling out misuse of power wherever and whenever it happens. That’s why it’s time for Newsom to step down.”\nMany, apparently, don\'t share her opinion. Recent polls shows Newsom with 33 percent of the likely vote, Villaraigosa at 13 percent and Republican John Cox with 20 percent. The top candidates on Tuesday will face off in November. \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Erbil\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(REUTERS)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nSeven months after Vice President Pence vowed to stop funding “ineffective” United Nations-led recovery efforts in northern Iraq and provide U.S. support directly to persecuted Christians and other minorities who suffered ISIS-directed genocide, and are now struggling to reclaim their homes, much of the promised additional U.S. support has not appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the beneficiaries have not yet been named, some of the most direly afflicted Christian groups, embedded in the region for nearly two millenia, say they have already been told by USAID that projects they submitted for financing have been vetoed, without explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the Christian churches in the Nineveh Plain in Northern Iraq were defaced or completely decimated by ISIS.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Courtesy Knights of Colombus )\n\n\n\nThe rejected proposals were aimed at providing jobs and economic security, and also the means of cultural survival, for the ancient communities, whose numbers are eroding as the lack of assistance forces them to leave Iraq in order to survive.\n\nMeantime, private-sector donations that the Christian organizations had previously relied on have apparently dried up, as donors assumed U.S. assistance would be quickly forthcoming.\nAs Archbishop Bashar Warda, head of the Chaldean Catholic Church in the northerly, Kurdish area of Erbil, told Fox News:\xa0 “We are left with still many thousands of families to care for and services to provide, and not a penny with which to do it.\xa0 In this sense, we are worse off now than we were two years ago.”\n“The only support for these displaced people comes from the church, and now it seems everyone is turning away from us.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChristianity is edgi closer to extinction in Iraq, where many ancient documents and artifacts have been destroyed or defaced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(The Associated Press)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop Warda’s church relief organization has often been the sole pillar of support for some 60,000 brutalized Christians—in a region that once held upwards of one million—who fled waves of murder, rape, displacement and plunder inflicted by ISIS, and the ensuing war to dislodge the Islamic extremists.\nHis new cries of dismay are a pointed reminder that political promises, even those of a vice president, are subsequently filtered through stodgy and often recalcitrant layers of bureaucracy.\nThese have the final say, despite assurances in January from the White House and USAID, two months after Pence’s initial avowal, that assistance would speedily be focused on Iraq’s battered and deprived minorities, including through newly reprogrammed and highly supervised efforts by the U.N.\xa0\xa0\nThe continued reliance on the U.N., which already contradicted Pence’s initial promise, was seen months ago by U.S. officials as a necessary compromise:\xa0 U.N. organizations, already on the ground in Iraq, were still believed to be the fastest and most efficient way to deliver aid to the minorities that had been, as one USAID official delicately put it, “overlooked” previously, mostly by the U.N. itself.\nIn fact, numerous exposes have documented U.N. neglect was far more widespread than accidental, ostensibly the outcome of high-minded aid policies that claimed to be uninfluenced by religious status or minority identity—exactly the characteristics, in other words, of those most savagely repressed by ISIS.\nDue in part to extensive U.N. collaboration with Iraqi government officials and other majority-Muslim interest groups, U.N. reconstruction efforts almost entirely favored a majority of returning Muslims who had fled the same conflicts, and Christian properties were often handed over to their majority neighbors.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nChristians fear their future in Iraq as funding dries up and promises fall short \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Fox News/Hollie McKay)\n\n\n\nOne of the rejected proposals from Archbishop Warda’s Catholic University of Erbil, jointly submitted with an organization of Iraq’s equally persecuted non-Christian Yazidi minority, specifically called for the creation of “a property rights program to protect minority…property rights against illegal seizures in the post-ISIS period.”\nAll that was supposed to change in the renegotiated deal with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), which has been the lead actor on most of the international reconstruction work. About $75 million in U.S.-provided “stabilization” funding was to be refocused on areas that were ancient homelands for hundreds of thousands of Christians, as well as the Yazidis, who were equally hated by ISIS.\nMost of that money was still focused on infrastructure projects that would benefit persecuted minorities and their Muslim neighbors equally, as their battered communities are rebuilt. But more communities in previously Christian areas were targeted. Additional monitors and auditors were added to the plans ensure that the stronger focus on those persecuted would remain in place.\nUnder the deal, another $75 million was allocated as follow-up spending, to be released once UNDP’s initial efforts were deemed to be on target.\nThe reformed U.N. efforts are underway—but so is the evaluation.\n“We are still assessing,” a senior USAID official told Fox News.\xa0 “We want to make sure the efforts are ongoing. We are getting them [UNDP] to take a look at every single activity. There will be a decision in the next month or so.”\nIRAQI CHRISTIAN HITS POPE’S \'SUBMISSIVE\' POLICY ON TOLERANCE\xa0FOR ISLAM, OTHER RELIGIONS\nUNDER THREAT? IRAN\'S QUIET INFILTRATION OVER IRAQI CHRISTIAN\xa0COMMUNITIES\n\n\n\n\n\nA church hall in the Christian village of Barzani, outside of Mosul, used by ISIS as target practice \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(FOX News/Hollie McKay)\n\n\n\nThat may be no time at all in Washington, but can easily be a lifetime in the poverty-stricken and ravaged Iraqi territories.\nAn even bigger cause of concern among the beleaguered minorities is some $35 million in fresh funds that bypasses the U.N., through an allegedly innovative USAID mechanism known as the Broad Agency Announcement, or BAA.\nThe blandly named initiative is intended to give the victims more input in a speeded-up relief effort—and, the victims of genocide thought, more direct influence on how the resulting money was awarded.\nFive months after USAID officials announced the BAA’s use in northern Iraq, the outcome of the much-advertised innovation is still grinding along in the bowels of USAID bureaucracy—except for those proposals that already have been summarily rejected.\nSpecific financial awards under the BAA will likely be formalized “in the next couple of months,” according to a senior USAID official—who added:\xa0 “We are very eager to get this done.”\nMaybe. To call the BAA a simple and decisive tool for cutting through and red tape would be very misleading.\xa0\xa0\nNor is it quite a novelty. According to officials in non-government humanitarian officials consulted by Fox News, the BAA, a consultative mechanism that indeed bypasses normal USAID procurement bureaucracy, has been in use at the agency for at least five years, and is now being used with increasing frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian leader Father Afram looks out at his once vibrant Christian town of Bahzani, Iraq outside of Mosul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Hollie McKay)\n\n\n\nIts virtues include the fact that it invites organizations of all kinds to present their best proposals for solving specific problems without a lengthy preliminary assessment by USAID, which can adopt the proposals a la carte if they seem promising.\nIn the case of northern Iraq, this was done at a special “co-creation” meeting held in March in Baghdad, to which Christian and minority groups, including Archbishop Warda’s relief organization, was invited.\nSo were, among others, the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), the U.S. government-funded United States Institute for Peace, and Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the globe-spanning Catholic relief organization. Two staffers from Pence’s staff also attended the session.\nUnder BAA rules, USAID can “encourage” organizations to form coalitions—which by their nature are likely to favor bigger international organizations, with substantial resources to cover elaborate U.S. funding requirements for extensive accounting and oversight.\nThe drawbacks of the BAA include the fact USAID can adopt its favorite proposals without giving any money or a contract to the organization that came up with the well-received notion.\n“You literally are giving away your best ideas,” one U.S. development expert who is familiar with the BAA process told Fox News. “To make matters worse, they don’t give a debrief to tell you what went wrong. You can’t improve an idea for the future.”\n“I have heard nightmare stories where they have had workshops, and USAID has taken ideas and given them to another implementer,” the expert said.\nBill O’Keefe, CRS vice president for government outreach and advocacy, told Fox News his organization’s proposals had been “green-lighted” for further consideration in the BAA, and called the process “really competitive”\n“It’s not surprising that many groups are not getting funded,” he said. “It happens to us all the time.”\xa0 With total annual revenues last year of nearly $1 billion, however, CRS can clearly roll with many punches.\nAs Archbishop Warda’s church discovered, along with offering no reasons for a veto, the BAA methodology does not include nor grounds for appeal.\nMoreover, even top officials at USAID are not necessarily privy to how BAA proposals are finally analyzed and judged. Those decisions are made at the level of USAID missions abroad—in this case, Fox News was told by a source briefed on some of the details, a five person group in Baghdad selected by the USAID head of mission.\nLong terrorized by ISIS fanatics, their injustices ignored by local governments and ignored for years by\xa0 ostensibly neutral, U.N.-managed relief efforts, it is perhaps unsurprising that\xa0 those championing Iraq’s barely-surviving minorities could see something sinister in the dashing of their hopes for U.S. support.\nAs Archbishop Warda told Fox News, “It is very clear to us that many people within the [U.S.] government are opposed to this.”\nThat accusation drew a stiff rejoinder from the White House, where an official told Fox News “we believe the administration is making a difference in aiding and resettling victims of religious persecution in Iraq. Tens of millions of dollars have been directed at the crisis, including 150 specific projects in the Ninewa Plain [a Christian heartland] identified by the U.S. and our partners, including faith-based NGOs.”\n“We hope that the initiatives will be judged by results and positive impact on these vulnerable populations—not by what organizations are awarded the money.”\nIn context, however, the millions of dollars and multiple projects mentioned by the official were the money committed so far under the reformed UNDP initiative—which is still being evaluated.\nAs for UNDP, a spokesperson told Fox News “new projects are being added to the pipeline every week” in minorities communities—as of late May, 415 in all, with half completed, “covering areas like health, water, electricity, housing and education.”\n“In some minority areas,” the spokesperson added,\xa0 “priorities have involved discussion with religious leaders and UNDP works closely with them to ensure these are met.\nThe spokesperson reeled off a list of 10 towns in areas that have significant Christian populations where projects were “prioritized by community leaders”— not necessary religious leaders - as well as “increased activities” in historically-Yazidi areas.\nA source deeply familiar with conditions in the minority communities, however, told Fox News the quality and outcome of the projects, completed or not, varies at best.\nMoreover, the source alleged, “the work is all being done by Kurdish or Arab Muslim contractors for USAID/UNDP.\xa0 Christians are not involved in either the work, or the planning of the work orders.\xa0 The quality of the work is poor since those doing the work have no interest in the communities themselves.”\nIn one center specifically cited by the UNDP spokesperson for its restoration work, Batnaya — formerly an overwhelmingly Christian enclave north of the re-conquered ISIS stronghold in Mosul — a local source related that a small group of\xa0Christians starting to return to the town were forced to flee again by hostile Iraqi government forces and local militias.\xa0\nAccording to that source, the Christians now believe Batnaya is being repaired so it can be inhabited by Muslims from Mosul who are still homeless.\nAccording to Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom at the conservative Hudson Institute, the murkiness of the USAID process and the frustration felt by Iraqi Christians and minorities point to the need for an inter-agency “genocide aid coordinator” to handle the issue more decisively, something she has long advocated.\nSuch a coordinator “could have taken into account all the complexities, gathered pertinent information, kept principals apprised and parried the obstacles to keep the reform policy on track.” Without one, Shea fears, “there simply is no hope.”\nOr at least, not much. Christian concerns, as well as those of other persecuted minorities, will get a wider audience at a June 14 hearing of a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ).\nSmith is the author and longtime supporter of a bill that would specifically support the transfer of U.S. government funds to faith-based and other groups doing humanitarian relief and reconstruction work in both Iraq and Syria. The bill has passed the House and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but has never reached the Senate floor.\n“Generally speaking, the presumption has been that if an indigenous entity wanted to use USAID money directly, it was not able to do the work and requisite accounting and reporting to our standards,” Smith told Fox News. It’s an attitude that he think’s Pence’s initial promise was intended to change.\n“But the policy is seen [by bureaucrats] as being political. Which means they are more or less ignoring the policy.”\nConcurs Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee:\xa0 “If the United States does not step up to help these Christians then who will?”\nBoth USAID and administration officials have told Archbishop Warda’s clients, in effect, to try again next time.\nSaid a White House official:\xa0 “The\xa0Administration has not defined or declared\xa0an end to\xa0assisting victims of persecution in Iraq.”\nThe U.S. government, however, may have more time available that the victims.\nHistorically speaking, notes Philip Jenkins, a world-renowned authority on the early history of Christianity who teaches at Baylor University, the collapse of Christianity in Iraq and even more so in neighboring Syria is “a catastrophe” that mirrors the earlier disappearance of far-flung Jewish populations from the region.\nJenkins passed on a grim Jewish observation about the fate of the two religions in the region: “after Saturday comes Sunday.”\nMeaning: after the disappearance of far-flung Jewish communities across the Middle East, the Christian minorities will be next.\nThe question may be whether the U.S. wants to continue to attempt a rebuttal.\n\nGeorge\xa0Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter:\xa0@GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

John Roberts reports from the White House.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump fired back Tuesday amid the Philadelphia furor over his decision to disinvite the Eagles from a White House event, touting a patriotic ceremony being held instead and declaring: “No escaping to Locker Rooms!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump triggered a backlash from the City of Brotherly Love after he rescinded his invitation for the Super Bowl champions amid the controversy over national anthem protests.\xa0\nThe White House\xa0is instead hosting a "Celebration of America" event on Tuesday.\xa0\n\n“We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.\n\nWe will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\nThe White House decision to disinvite the whole team marked the end of speculation over whether the Eagles would visit the White House in some capacity. The team reportedly wanted to send a small group of players.\xa0\n“The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!” Trump tweeted late Monday.\xa0\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP SWAYED NFL OWNERS ON ANTHEM RULES, KAEPERNICK CASE DEPOSITIONS REVEAL\xa0\nBut Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney blasted Trump as “not a true patriot” and a “fragile egomaniac” over the move.\xa0\n“Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend,” Kenney said in a statement.\nLast month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the league would fine teams and league personnel who do not “stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem.” Goodell said the league unanimously agreed to the vote, though San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York abstained. \nThe new overhaul does allow players to remain in the locker room for the anthem.\xa0\nTrump has praised the new policy, but his Eagles decision -- and swipe Tuesday at those who stay in the locker room -- reflects ongoing tension between his White House and players protesting police violence by sitting out the national anthem. \nTrump also used his Twitter account Tuesday to note past events the White House has held with other championship teams.\xa0\n“We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P.M.,” Trump tweeted, adding minutes later that “@NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House. It was a great day for a great sport!”\n\nWe have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others.

His cancellation of the meeting, not so much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou didn\'t have to be a master diplomat to discern that things were rapidly going downhill between the two countries. North Korea may well have backed him into a corner. And a president who places a premium on projecting strength was not going to stand for that.\nAmid indications that Kim might back out of the June 12 summit in Singapore, Trump decided to strike first.\n\nWhile experts analyze the verbal sniping that led up to the cancellation, I think that misses the larger point. When two world leaders want to meet, they ignore divisive rhetoric and sit down together. That was certainly the case with all those Soviet summits from Nikita Khrushchev to Mikhail Gorbachev.\nStill, the atmosphere turned chilly from the moment that Kim objected to the U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which he\'d previously said were fine. Then came North Korean objections to televised comments by John Bolton when the national security adviser said the administration would follow the Libya model for denuclearization—not exactly appealing words to the North Koreans, since Muammar Qaddafi wound up dead.\nAfter Vice President Pence told Fox\'s Martha MacCallum that "this will only end like the Libya model ended if Kim Jong Un doesn\'t make a deal," the North’s foreign vice minister called Pence a "political dummy" and said it was up to the White House "whether the U.S. will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown."\n\n\n\nThat may have been the last straw for Trump, who said earlier this week there was a "substantial chance" that the summit would not come off. Yesterday he pulled the plug. No matter that North Korea had just destroyed its nuclear test site, though some experts believe it had been damaged beyond repair.\nDonald Trump often walks away from the table, or threatens to, as he did as a New York businessman. He has spoken of pulling out of NAFTA several times. He vowed to pull out of the Iranian nuclear deal before finally doing so.\nThis is, to him, a negotiating style, all part of what he once called the art of the deal. He is, after all, the man who repeatedly denounced Kim as Little Rocket Man and threatened to destroy his country if necessary before becoming his negotiating partner.\nIndeed, Trump’s letter to Kim contained some conciliatory notes: "Someday, I look very much forward to meeting you ... If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write."\nThat is called leaving the door open.\nSome skeptics believed that Trump was giving Kim the world stature conferred by such a meeting without getting anything in return. Others said the U.S. wasn\'t ready for a nuclear summit, that enough groundwork hadn\'t been laid for successful talks. In this view, Trump was more interested in the optics of a splashy summit, and a potential Nobel Prize, than in doing the arduous work of negotiating a verifiable disarmament in exchange for the elimination of economic sanctions.\nIf that\'s true, the cancellation might buy more time for a successful summit down the road—if such a meeting ever materializes.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

Tom Garrett announced he won\'t seek re-election, blasting the Democratic candidate in the race as an anti-Semite and vowing to defeat her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrett cited his battle with alcoholism in\xa0stepping aside Monday, just days after reassuring voters he would stay in the race.\n“Any person – Republican, Democrat or independent—who has known me for any period of time and has any integrity knows two things: I am a good man and I’m an alcoholic,” Garrett said in a video recorded at the state Capitol in Richmond.\xa0\n\nVirginia GOP Chairman John Whitbeck thanked Garrett for his service -- and promptly took a shot at Democratic nominee Leslie Cockburn:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"Congressman Garrett’s decision not to seek re-election makes it even more imperative that we select the right nominee to defeat the anti-Semitic Democrat nominee, Leslie Cockburn."\nThe state party has been throwing barbs at Cockburn, a former producer for "60 Minutes" and reporter for Vanity Fair -- and mother of actress Olivia Wilde -- over past comments she made about Israel.\xa0\n\n\n\nVIRGINIA REP. TOM GARRETT WILL NOT SEEK RE-ELECTION: \'I\'M AN ALCOHOLIC\'\xa0\nIn a lengthy statement in early May, the party described her as a “virulent anti-Semite,” pointing specifically to a book she co-authored with her husband in the early 1990s: “Dangerous Liaison: The Inside Story of the U.S.-Israeli Covert Relationship.”\nThe statement cited a New York Times book review that accused the authors of “Israel-bashing for its own sake.”\n“Its first message is that, win or lose, smart or dumb, right or wrong, suave or boorish, Israelis are a menace,” the review said. “The second is that the Israeli-American connection is somewhere behind just about everything that ails us.”\nCockburn\'s campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News, but on Twitter she linked to an article that said claims her book was anti-Semitic were "completely unfounded, without evidence, and should be dismissed without hesitation."\xa0She also recently told the Rappahannock News, “This is what the Republicans do,” before describing the book as "a very serious book."\nWhile Republicans are certainly not writing off the race, the immediate challenge for the party will be to find a replacement candidate.\xa0\nA spokesperson for the state GOP said the members of the 5th Congressional District Republican Committee will meet soon to decide on a new nominee.\xa0The Washington Post reported that a string of potential candidates includes state Sen. William Stanley Jr. and tech executive Michael Del Rosso, although there appeared to be no clear favorite.\nBut while Republicans have expressed confidence in their chances, they were facing headwinds even before Garrett\'s decision.\xa0\nThe Washington Post reports that despite winning election by 16 points in 2016, Garrett had been outraised by Cockburn -- who also had more cash on hand.\xa0\nAdditionally, Politico reported last week that staffers had accused Garrett and his wife of forcing them to do personal chores including carrying groceries and walking their dog.\n"We became their gofers,” one former staffer told the outlet.\nGarrett had dismissed the claims as "a series of half truths and whole lies."\nFox News’ Madeline Fish and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Already, his investigation has led to charges for\xa0four Trump campaign associates, though none of the charges are directly related to any misconduct by the president\'s campaign.\nTrump has in the past expressed willingness to testify under oath as part of Mueller’s investigations and has repeatedly denied any “collusion” with Russians.\n\nWhy is Mueller overseeing the Russia investigation?\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller departs after a closed-door meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee about Russian meddling in the election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice\xa0announced the appointment\xa0of Mueller to oversee the federal investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election in May 2017.\nThe appointment came after a growing cry – mostly from Democrats – for someone outside the Justice Department to handle the probe. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had already recused himself from the investigation.\xa0\n\n\n\nMueller led the FBI through the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and served under presidential administrations of both parties.\nFor the inquiry into the 2016 election, Mueller has the authority to prosecute any crimes uncovered during this investigation, and he was given wide authority to investigate whether Trump or his associates colluded with the Kremlin to win the White House.\nHas anyone been charged?\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, one focus of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, hides behind a car visor as he leaves his home in Alexandria, Va., after being asked to surrender to federal authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)\n\n\n\nIn his leading role, Mueller took over an ongoing investigation into Paul Manafort\'s financial dealings in Ukraine.\nManafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and Richard Gates were indicted on Oct. 27 on multiple counts, including: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements and failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts.\xa0Manafort and Gates initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nNearly four months later, on Feb. 22, the pair was hit with additional tax evasion and bank fraud charges\xa0and the amount of money Manafort was accused of laundering through offshore accounts increased to $30 million.\nGates pleaded guilty\xa0to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges\xa0on Feb. 23.\xa0After the plea, Mueller moved to drop the 22 bank and tax fraud charges against Gates, possibly suggesting that the former Trump campaign official is cooperating and providing good information to Mueller\'s team.\xa0\nMueller also accused Manafort of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine. Manafort has continued to maintain his innocence, pleading\xa0not guilty to the charges in federal court on March 8.\nMichael Flynn, the administration’s short-lived national security adviser, was\xa0charged in December\xa0with lying to the FBI about certain conversations he had with a Russian ambassador. He pleaded guilty.\xa0\nAdditionally, George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to one count of making false statements to investigating FBI agents, according to\xa0court documents. Papadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser for Trump’s campaign.\nAlex van der Zwaan, an attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about Gates in the Russia inquiry. In April 2018, he was sentenced to 30 days in prison, making him the first to be sentenced in the investigation.\xa0He\xa0was\xa0released from prison\xa0on June 4 and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.\xa0\nRichard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election, pleaded guilty in February 2018 to using stolen identities to set up the accounts. The U.S. government said Pinedo was not aware he was dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts, however.\nThree Russian entities and 13 Russian nationals were indicted by a federal grand jury on Feb. 16\xa0for allegedly interfering in the election.\xa0Mueller\'s case alleged those involved had a\xa0sophisticated plot to wage “information warfare” on the U.S.\nHowever, the Justice Department did not say the actions had an impact on the outcome of the election. Deputy Attorney Gen. Rod Rosenstein said,\xa0"There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity."\nHas Trump been questioned?\nThe president has not been questioned by Mueller or his team yet.\nHowever, The New York Times has obtained questions Mueller has provided to Trump’s lawyers that he wants the president to answer. The questions include information related to Flynn, Sessions, fired FBI Director James Comey, former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe and his campaign’s connections to Russia, including the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting with Manafort,\xa0Donald Trump, Jr., the president’s oldest son and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n“So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were ‘leaked’ to the media. No questions on Collusion,” Trump said in a tweet. “Oh, I see … you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!”\n\nSo disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 1, 2018\n\n\nWhat\'s this we keep hearing about a controversy with Mueller’s staff?\nThe Trump administration has sharply criticized Mueller’s investigation, as several of his attorneys on staff\xa0donated to Democratic campaigns, including to Trump’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.\nAdditionally, two FBI officials – Peter Strzok and Lisa Page – are under fire for the anti-Trump text messages they exchanged during the election. Strzok was part of Mueller’s team but was removed after the text messages were revealed.\nWhat has Trump said about Mueller’s investigation?\nTrump has oftentimes dismissed the allegations that he colluded with Russia during the election. He said he is “looking forward” to eventually\xa0 being questioned under oath by Mueller.\nHe’s said the allegations are a “fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most of all demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.”\n"I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve," Trump said at a rally in West Virginia last year.\n\n"I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one..."\n- President Trump\n\nThe president also\xa0warned Mueller\xa0to stay within certain boundaries as he investigates.\nTrump and Mueller\xa0have sent messages\xa0“back and forth,” according to Trump’s outside counsel. A spokesman for Mueller told Fox News that the messages have been “very professional.”\nFox News\' Madeline Farber, Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Judge Napolitano breaks down the cases.\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration in the case of a pregnant immigrant teenager who was able to get an abortion after filing a lawsuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a unanimous decision issued Monday, the high court vacated a lower court decision, which was initially in favor of the teen.\xa0The decision is about the teen\'s individual case, however, and doesn\'t appear to disrupt ongoing litigation about the ability of immigrant teens in government custody to obtain abortions.\nThe teenager at the center of this case illegally entered the U.S. in September as a 17-year-old and was taken to a federally funded shelter in Texas for minors who enter the country without their parents.\n\nThe teen, referred to as Jane Doe, learned while in custody that she was pregnant and sought an abortion. A state court gave her permission, but federal officials, citing a policy of refusing to facilitate abortions for pregnant minors in its shelters, refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others could take her for the procedure.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union helped Doe sue the Trump administration and get a court order in her favor. But before the administration could try to block the procedure, she got the abortion.\xa0\nThe government’s lawyers argued that the ACLU lawyers did not alert them that the teen’s abortion would take place earlier than initially scheduled.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected the suggestion by the Trump administration that lawyers for the ACLU might deserve to be sanctioned, ruling only to scrap the lower court decision since the case became moot after the procedure.\n“Doe’s individual claim for injunctive relief—the only claim addressed by the D.C. Circuit—became moot after the abortion,” the Supreme Court opinion said. “It is undisputed that [her guardian] and her lawyers prevailed in the D.C. Circuit, took voluntary, unilateral action to have Doe undergo an abortion sooner than initially expected, and thus retained the benefit of that favorable judgment.”\xa0\nThe lawsuit could return to the Supreme Court at a later date.\xa0\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Bernie Sanders’ failed 2016 presidential run resigned Wednesday, raising concerns of a racial strain within the organization, a report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Revolution former co-vice chair Catalina Velasquez, an undocumented immigrant and transgender activist, said she left the group because it was insensitive to Latino and immigrant issues. The departure fueled worries of tension between Latinos and African-Americans within the group, Politico reported.\n“For the past month, we have been fighting divisive narratives targeting immigrants and pinning us against other oppressed peoples,” Velasquez wrote in\xa0a letter\xa0she posted on Twitter. “I have faced this with little to no support from the organizational leadership.”\n\n\nBelow is my public statement resigning from the Board of Directors at @OurRevolution. Thank you to everyone in these circles who have supported my leadership! May the progressive movement continue to engage and do right by immigrant, transgender, and queer communities! pic.twitter.com/XXknpENSik— Catalina Velasquez (@ConsultCatalina) May 24, 2018\n\n\nActivists within the group had reportedly complained that issues important to one group, such as immigration reform or Black Lives Matter, have failed to become a focus for the other.\nAdditional complaints reportedly lodged against the organization included its transparency concerns in making endorsements, a drop-off in fundraising and a failure to influence major elections.\nVelasquez’s resignation came a month after the departure of Lucy Flores, the group’s former political director, who left after claiming the group ignored Latino issues, the outlet reported. Insiders have labeled these issues as “growing pains” in the transition from presidential campaign to grass-roots organization.\n\n\n\nOur Revolution was formed by Sanders’ top campaign workers after his 2016 presidential primary loss, in a bid to keep his grass-roots army ready for a potential 2020 presidential bid, according to Politico.\nSanders, who was criticized in 2016 for failing to connect with black voters and earn their votes in Southern states, announced Monday that he will seek re-election to the U.S. Senate. The move has been largely viewed as preparation for the 2020 campaign.\nWhile Sanders has attempted to energize support across diverse groups, skeptical parties say he “struggled then and clearly now” reaching black voters.\n“The guy’s from Vermont, it’s not like he has a massive [black] constituency,” Ray McKinnon, a black pastor from Charlotte, N.C., told\xa0Vox\xa0about Sanders, a native of Brooklyn, N.Y. “He failed to connect on a visceral sense.”\nSanders will travel to California in June to meet with trade unionists and rally with Black Lives Matter activists.\nFox News’ Lukas Mikelionis contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, seen in an undated photo, traveled to California on Saturday in support of wage increases for workers.\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(Associated Press)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., rallied California’s Disneyland Resort workers in Anaheim on Saturday in support of a state wage-increase measure that some say would cost the state “thousands” of jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same speech, Sanders also praised Disney CEO Bob Iger for canceling ABC\'s “Roseanne” after its star\'s recent Twitter meltdown -- even though the sitcom\'s shutdown reportedly threw hundreds of crew members out of work.\nSo it may be no surprise that some observers were left skeptical of Sanders\' credentials as an advocate for working Americans.\n\n“While touting himself as a friend of the working man, Bernie has come all this way to support a measure that will result in thousands of lost jobs for the people of Anaheim,” Todd Ament, CEO of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, said in a written statement.\n\nBernie Sanders barnstorms Southern California, urges wage increases for Disney, port workers https://t.co/LQVr75Orql pic.twitter.com/CEbU2imC6y— O.C. Register (@ocregister) June 2, 2018\n\n\nAment has previously criticized minimum-wage hikes in Seattle and Los Angeles, saying they led to workers either losing their jobs or seeing their hours cut,\xa0the Orange County Register reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nTodd Ament, CEO, Anaheim Chamber of Commerce\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n"While touting himself as a friend of the working man, Bernie has come all this way to support a measure that will result in thousands of lost jobs."\n- Todd Ament, CEO, Anaheim Chamber of Commerce\n\nThe California proposal Sanders championed Saturday would raise the minimum wage for affected workers to at least $15 an hour beginning in 2019, with $1 increases annually until reaching $18 an hour by Jan. 1, 2022, the Register reported.\n\n\n\n“If a corporation like Disney has enough to pay its CEO over $400 million in a four-year period, it damn well has enough to pay its workers at least 15 bucks an hour,” Sanders said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose workers, however, apparently won\'t include as many as 300 Californians that\xa0TMZ\xa0reported likely lost their jobs in the "Roseanne" shutdown. Nevertheless, the socialist democrat praised Iger for ending the comedy series. The ABC network operates under the Disney umbrella.\n“Recently, Disney CEO Bob Iger did the right thing and canceled Roseanne after her racist tweet,” Sanders wrote, referring to comedian Roseanne Barr\'s post aimed at a former adviser to former President Barack Obama. He also called on Iger to “lead corporate America away” from the greed “destroying” the country.\n\nRecently, Disney CEO Bob Iger did the right thing and cancelled Roseanne after her racist tweet. I say to Mr. Iger: you have another opportunity to lead. Stand with working families by paying all your employees a living wage and making health care a right, not a privilege.— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) June 2, 2018\n\n\nWhile Sanders alternately criticized and praised Iger, Disney\'s corporate office seemed to take a more decisive position regarding Sanders.\n“While Mr. Sanders continues to criticize Disney to keep himself in the headlines, we continue to support our cast members through investments in wages and education," Disneyland spokeswoman Suzi Brown said.\n\n“While Mr. Sanders continues to criticize Disney to keep himself in the headlines, we continue to support our cast members through investments in wages and education." \n- Suzi Brown, Disneyland spokeswoman\n\nThe Disneyland Resort announced last week that it previously offered a 36 percent pay increase to about 9,500 resort workers over three years, the Los Angeles Times reported. The offer would provide a minimum salary of $15 an hour by 2020, one year later than the proposed measure.\n“We are proud of our commitment to our cast," Brown said, "and the fact that more people choose to work at Disneyland Resort than anywhere else in Orange County."\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Hogan discusses how cancer diagnosis changed him\n\n\n\n\nMaryland Democrats were shocked in 2014 that Republican Larry Hogan had won the governorship in their deep-blue state and have since been determined to deny him a second term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the notably-resilient Hogan is running strong in 2018 -- leading by double-digits against his closest Democrat challengers and amassing a war chest bigger than the combined total of the entire Democratic primary field.\nThe Hogan reelection campaign this week announced raising $1.2 million from April 10 to May 15 and having roughly $9 million in cash -- more than twice the total of his seven major Democratic challengers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer NAACP leader Ben Jealous was an early favorite to take a GOP-held gubernatorial seat in Maryland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nEven Hogan admitted that he pulled off a “nearly impossible” win four years ago -- becoming only the second Republican governor in the state in nearly five decades. And a Hogan win in November would mark the first time since 1954 and only the second time in Maryland history that a Republican was reelected governor.\xa0\nMaryland Democrats seemed ready in 2014 to extent their dominance in state-wide politics, with White House-seeking Gov. Martin O’Malley poised to hand off the governorship to Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown. But voters thought differently. Weary of increasing taxes and fees under O’Malley and uninspired by Brown’s campaign, they elected the pro-business Hogan.\n“O’Malley’s political ambitions coupled with Maryland’s economic environment really did create an opening for Hogan,” Todd Eberly, a St. Mary’s College of Maryland politics professor, told Fox News on Wednesday. “Hogan’s message was Maryland is business-friendly. And he made clear that the state had to dial back some regulations.”\n\n\n\nShortly after Hogan’s upset win, Democrats began lining up to defeat him.\nAnd they seem to have become more energized along the way by the liberal opposition to President Trump.\nEven before the official 2018 election cycle started, Maryland Democrats had a full slate of high-profile and experienced candidates -- including former NAACP leader Ben Jealous and Rushern Baker, the former county executive for Prince George’s County, one of the state’s biggest Democratic voting blocs.\nHowever, Hogan now leads all seven Democratic candidates by double digits in essentially every poll. And he will have much of his $9 million in cash for the general election, considering he has no primary challenger.\nVoters and political experts like Eberly argue that such a large field of Democrats -- swept into the race by the favorable political climate -- has handicapped the party’s chances of defeating Hogan. However, they expect the governor’s lead will narrow after state’s June 26 primary.\n“The race will tighten when Democrats pick their nominee,” Lou Jacobson, who handicaps gubernatorial races for Governing magazine, said Wednesday. “As the race sharpens, Democrats will come home. Hogan is certainly in good shape, especially in Maryland. But it’s going to be a close contest.”\nAmong the underlying indicators, Jacobson argues, are the polls’ high percentages of undecided voters and Hogan yet to cross the 50 percent threshold with likely voters, despite having a plus-60-percent approval rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrince George\'s County Executive Rushern Baker, who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor in Maryland, with running-mateElizabeth Embry\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\n“That means they might like what he’s doing, but they’re not necessarily going to vote for him,” Jacobson said.\nPolls show Hogan with at least a 13-point advantage over Baker. He is followed in the primary polls by Jealous, state Sen. Rich Madaleno, former Obama White House official Krishanti Vignarajah, lawyer Jim Shea and tech entrepreneur Alec Ross.\nBaltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz was in second place until he died on May 10 of heart attack. His campaign has since been taken over by running-mate Valerie Ervin.\nJealous emerged as an early favorite, in large part because of his national name recognition and an endorsement from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sander. Yet, Baker has in numerous candidate forums so far shown himself as an experienced legislator. A win would make Baker the state’s first black governor.\nReported fundraising totals released this week show Shea having raised nearly $700,000 over the past three months, with $1.4 million in cash. He’s followed by Jealous, who raised about $1 million, much of that from outside the state, and with about $660,000 in available cash. Baker, third in fundraising, reportedly took in just $543,000, with $577,000 cash on hand.\nJacobson and Eberly attribute Hogan’s favorable position headed into the general election largely to him governed like the moderate he vowed to be -- focusing on the economy, avoiding divisive social issues like abortion and gay marriage and swiftly addressing the state’s opioid crisis.\nHogan’s has also worked well with the Democrat-controlled legislature.\n“He’s different in both style and substance from what voters see in Washington with its partisan infighting and gridlock,” campaign manager Jim Barnett said Friday.\nHogan has also continued to distance himself from President Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign he did not support, though Democrats repeatedly try to tie Hogan to the president, who remains unpopular in liberal-leaning states.\nEarlier this week, they seized upon state Republican party Chairman and Hogan campaign legal adviser, Dirk Haire, saying that Trump has been “successful” in his roughly first 14 months in office.\n“The only thing Donald Trump has done for Maryland is raise health insurance premiums and increase taxes for middle class families,”\xa0said state Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathleen Matthews.\xa0“Maryland voters now know that Governor Hogan will defend and enable Donald Trump’s destructive policies, if elected to a second term.”\nMaryland Democratic Party spokesman Fabion Seaton said Saturday that the group has been organizing in Maryland for more than a year.\n“When Kathleen Matthews became chair of the party, she made clear there would be no more off-election years in Maryland,” he said.\nSeaton also touted a grassroots operation that he says has contacted more than 100,000 potential voters and has reached beyond the historically Democratic strongholds of Baltimore City and Montgomery and Prince George’s County to include parts of western Maryland.\n“It’s unprecedented, way beyond the point you’d expect by now,” he said. “We’re competing in every single county.”\nThe 62-year-old Hogan has shown incredible resilience in the face of challenge -- having been diagnosed in 2015 with cancer that is now in remission.\nHowever, he’ll have to overcome several other hurdles to win reelection -- including some daunting math.\nDemocrats have a 2-to-1 advantage over Republicans in registered voters in Maryland. In addition, the GOP hasn’t controlled the General Assembly since the early 1900s and the state’s last Republican senator was elected in 1970.\nHogan could also be at the mercy of the national electorate, which has the potential to create a wave election that could give Democrats control of the U.S. House, a handful of state legislatures across the country and the Maryland governorship.\n“I feel like we’re well positioned, but we’re still working hard. You can’t count your chickens before they hatch in a state like Maryland and in a year like this,” Barnett also said.\nRepublicans’ control of 33 governorships and roughly two-thirds of state legislatures.\n“The person Hogan really has to beat is Trump,” Eberly said. “If it’s a referendum on Hogan, he wins.

Today, he lives in the White House,” Helmer, who is challenging incumbent Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., said. In the video, an image of bin Laden is shown before the camera pans to the White House and Trump.\n“No one, not even the president, is above the law,” he continued.\n\n\nNo one, not even the President, is above the law. We need to elect leaders who will stand up to him and fight for our progressive values. #VA10 pic.twitter.com/YpUe0NvwT6— Dan Helmer (@HelmerVA10) May 30, 2018\n\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Raj Shah told Fox News the ad was "nothing short of reprehensible." He said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., should denounce the "abhorrent" ad.\xa0\n"While the Leader does not condone the end of this ad, if the President wants to join in raising the level of civility in politics he should begin with himself," a Pelosi spokesman said in response.\nOn his campaign website, Helmer said he and his wife “were shocked by the 2016 elections and alarmed at the actions of this Administration and Congress.”\n\n\n\nHelmer, who said he’s “different” and “not a politician” in the spot, released another ad earlier this month which showed him buying a rifle at a gun show without having to complete a background check. Federal background checks are required in order for someone to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer; private sales are not subjected to background checks.\xa0\nLast year, his campaign released a “Top Gun”-style ad that featured Helmer singing karaoke to a Comstock lookalike at a bar about her lack of town hall meetings and opposition to Planned Parenthood and ObamaCare.\nFox News\' Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

It gets worse here every day.” – Guns N’ Roses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California primary next Tuesday could serve as a sentinel indicating whether the House of Representatives is truly in play in the midterms.\xa0\nBut of late, Democrats are struggling in the Golden State. And if they can\'t deliver in next week\'s contests, their shot\xa0at reclaiming the House could suffer a major setback.\n\nIt starts in the “jungle.” More specifically, California’s “jungle primary.”\nCalifornia conducts a “top two” primary system. A “jungle.” That means a pair of candidates – regardless of party – matriculate to the general election in November. It’s not guaranteed that there will be one Democrat and one Republican to emerge Tuesday and face one another in autumn. It could be a Democrat and a Republican. Or it could be two Democrats. Or, it could be two Republicans.\xa0\nDEMS STRUGGLING TO FLIP KEY CALIF. HOUSE SEATS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats boast built-in advantages in California. This is why Democrats relish the the idea of a top-two system. On its face, this is a boon in liberal enclaves and left-leaning districts.\nBut strangely, Democrats could be a victim of their own success in the primary. President Trump fueled a flood of Democratic House candidates all over the country. Democratic interest surged in Democratic strongholds. Still, the party struggled to unify behind one or even two candidates in some of these districts. That means that Democratic voters will likely speckle their ballots for an array of candidates instead of just one. That dilutes Democratic votes. Yes, Democrats may collectively garner the most votes in some of these districts. But the fear is that two Republicans could squeak through as the top vote getters. Republicans could effectively block Democrats from the ballot in November as infighting splinters the left.\nIt\'s another sign of Democratic problems this cycle. In December, Democrats enjoyed a 13-point advantage over Republicans in the national generic ballot for Congress. That edge plummeted to just 3 or 4 points now. Chatter about a Democratic wave is diminishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the election were held today, Democrats would need to flip a net of 22 seats to secure control of the House. Democrats could make up a lot of that ground in California alone.\nCalifornia is a Democratic state. With immigration and DACA front and center, Democrats are angling for the seats held by retiring GOP Reps. Ed Royce and Darrell Issa. Democrats came close to knocking off Issa in 2016. Then there are also major races against GOP Reps. Steve Knight, David Valadao, Jeff Denham, Mimi Walters, Dana Rohrabacher and Duncan Hunter Jr.\nDemocrats hope to unseat Rohrabacher over perceptions he’s aligned too closely with Russia. Hillary Clinton narrowly carried Denham’s district and won Valadao’s district by 15 points. Clinton topped Trump by 17 points in Walters’ district. Ethics clouds loom over Hunter. Democrats are poised to excoriate California Republicans who voted yea on the tax reform bill. Rohrabacher voted nay on the final version of the tax package. Issa did, too, but he’s not running again.\xa0\nDemocrats likely need to flip at least five if not all of these California seats to have a legitimate path toward winning the House in November. But any shot Democrats could have may disintegrate if their supporters scatter their votes Tuesday. That could propel Republicans to the top two slots in the jungle primary and doom the Democrats long before November arrives.\nSuccess in California on either the Democratic or Republican side of the aisle could have consequences for leadership on Capitol Hill next year. Big Democratic wins in California could catapult House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., back to the speakership. Major losses could mean curtains for the San Francisco Democrat. There’s also risk for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Delivering GOP upsets in the jungle primary would solidify McCarthy as the odds-on successor to retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- should Republicans retain the House. The downside for McCarthy isn’t as significant as Pelosi’s. But a poor performance by Republicans in California certainly doesn’t help McCarthy’s leadership aspirations.\nNo one is quite sure which way the midterms could go. Any honest Republican will tell you that they were reasonably sure 2006 was going be a bloodbath for their party by late spring/early summer of that year. Republicans are certainly worried right now. But not petrified.\nIt’s also a stretch to divine too much from the results of recent House special elections. Democrats finally nabbed a special election victory in March with a win by Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa. Democrats didn’t capture special elections for House seats in Kansas, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and, more recently, Arizona. All were Republican seats to start with. But Democrats made all of those races more competitive than they should have been.\nHowever, there may be a singular, pertinent takeaway from those special elections and what they mean to the midterms: Democrats will likely run stronger on historic GOP turf than they have in the past. But like the special elections revealed, making those contests closer may not be enough to covert customary Republican seats into Democratic gains.\nTuesday’s jungle primary may not portend a total disaster for Democrats come November even if things don’t go their way. There are certainly lots of seats Democrats can try to flip in Pennsylvania. There are a few seats in play in North Carolina and Florida, along with various seats in Colorado, Indiana, New Mexico, Washington and Nevada. But California is California. No state delivers a prize as grand.\nIf Democrats botch the jungle primary, they may be destined to wander in the wilderness.\nCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!” Trump\xa0tweeted.\n“A U.S. delegation is in ongoing talks with North Korean officials at Panmunjom,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement about the meeting, reported first by\xa0The Washington Post. “We continue to prepare for a meeting between the President and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.”\n\n\nOur United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2018\n\n\nOn Sunday morning, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commended Trump for trying to get North Korea to meet and agree to dismantling its nuclear arsenal, but warned all sides must first agree on the terms and warned that tactics last week are “right out of the North Korean playbook.”\n“We’re in the three generations of that playbook now,” Blunt\xa0told “Fox News Sunday.”\xa0”Act like you want to negotiate and come up with some outlandish view of what that negotiation means.”\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nBlunt, Coons on Trump administration\'s North Korea strategy\n\n\nHe suggested the tactic is an attempt to extract a concession in exchange for a promise that isn’t kept.\n\n\n\nBlunt\xa0also said all three sides —\xa0the U.S., North Korea and South Korea —\xa0must first agree on the terms of the summit, including what exactly is the “denuclearization” of North Korea.\nAnd, he lauded Trump, whose presidential campaign he supported, for his efforts toward such an historic summit.\n“I think the president has got the North Koreans in a place that any other president might not have managed to get done,” Blunt said. “He’s very willing to reach out in new directions through the South Korean president, willing to meet with the North Korean president but also willing to walk away.”\nA meeting Saturday between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a U.S. ally, renewed optimism.\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nGordon Chang: The North Koreans need this summit\n\n\nTheir quickly arranged meeting, the second in a month, appeared to highlight a sense of urgency on both sides of the world’s most heavily armed border.\nMoon, who brokered the summit between Washington and Pyongyang, likely used Saturday’s meeting to confirm Kim’s willingness to enter nuclear negotiations with Trump and clarify what steps Kim has in mind in the process of denuclearization, said Hong Min, a senior analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification.\nTrump said Saturday\xa0that conversations about a potential summit were “going along very well.”\nThey were still “looking at June 12 in Singapore, that hasn’t changed,” Trump said at the White House Saturday.\nHe added that if “it would be a great thing” if they were “successful in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”\nHe announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the scheduled June summit in Singapore. The cancellation apparently followed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo setting some strict ground-rules ahead for the meeting, which in turn resulted in North Korea vice foreign minister reportedly saying that Pyongyang could make the United States “taste an appalling tragedy” and that a stalemate could lead to a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.”\n“Based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,”\xa0Trump wrote in his letter to Kim.\xa0”Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world, will not take place.”\nHe called the imploded summit a “sad moment in history.”\n“You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,” Trump wrote to Kim. “If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write.

Michelle Lujan Grisham leads the pack ahead of the primary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Mike Segar)\n\n\n\nDemocrats are hoping to turn New Mexico blue with the gubernatorial race this year with an electorate that has been tilting progressive. Susana Martinez, the current Republican governor, cannot seek re-election due to term limits.\nFor the Democrats, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, state Sen. Joseph Cervantes and entrepreneur Jeff Apodaca are contending for their party’s nomination. Both Lujan Grisham and Apodaca come from political families in the Land of Enchantment state.\nLujan Grisham, seen as the frontrunner among Democrats, has already secured endorsements from Planned Parenthood, EMILY’s List and a bevy of local labor unions, according to her campaign website. She’s also been endorsed by state Attorney General Hector Balderas.\n\n\n\nLonna Atkeson, a University of New Mexico political science professor, told the Albuquerque Journal that Grisham could have an “edge,” as she\'s the only woman in the race.\nFor Republicans, Rep. Steve Pearce is running unopposed. Pearce is known in Congress as a reserved, “low word-count guy.” He’s voted about 85 percent of time in agreement with President Trump -- although he’s publicly opposed the border wall.\nPearce’s campaign has placed an emphasis on job creation as New Mexico has the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation.\nDemocrats already control much of New Mexico politics, including the legislature and other statewide offices. A win for Democrats in this race could shut out Republicans from redistricting decisions made in 2021.\nClinton took New Mexico with 48 percent of the vote, compared to Trump\'s 40 percent.\nMontana Senate\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left, Russell Fagg, Troy Downing, Matt Rosendale and Al Olszewski are competing for the chance to challenge Democratic Sen. Jon Tester this fall. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Matt Volz)\n\n\n\nAlthough incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, has emphasized his record of voting for more than a dozen bills signed into law by Trump, November’s general election is considered a toss-up by Fox News.\nFour Republicans are vying for the Republican nomination to take on Tester in the fall: combat veteran Troy Downing, Judge Russ Fagg, state Sen. Albert Olszewski and state auditor Matt Rosendale.\nAll four GOP candidates, even Fagg, who is considered to be a favorite among the more establishment-type Republicans, have aligned themselves with the president.\n“It’s all been a competition to see who can be the most aligned with Trump. It’s a reflection of where these candidates think the Republican Party is in Montana,” Dr. Robert Saldin, a University of Montana political science professor, told Fox News.\nTrump won Montana with about 56 percent of the vote in 2016. In comparison, 2008 Republican nominee John McCain garnered about 50 percent.\nAlthough none of the four Republican candidates have star name recognition, Saldin said a Tester loss shouldn’t be ruled out.\n“Anytime you’re running as a Republican in Montana statewide, you’ve got a shot,” he said.\nWith endorsements from Sens. Mike Lee, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, Rosendale has emerged as a frontrunner in the primary, Dr. David C.W. Parker, a Montana State University political science professor told Fox News.\nSouth Dakota governor\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Kristi Noem faces state Attorney Gen. Marty Jackley in the Republican gubernatorial primary in South Dakota.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n\n\nRep. Kristi Noem and state Attorney Gen. Marty Jackley are facing off in the Republican gubernatorial primary in South Dakota.\nAlthough it started off cordial, the Republican primary has turned a bit volatile, The Argus Leader reported -- especially in campaign ads and a recent debate. Jackley has painted Noem as a Washington insider, while Noem has touted her relationship with Trump.\nThe primary is a close one:\xa0a recent poll from The Argus Leader and KELO-TV has Noem ahead by only one percentage point.\nWhoever wins the GOP primary will likely face state Sen. Billie Sutton, a Democrat who is running unopposed. The seat is currently held by Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who is term-limited.\nIn the presidential election, Trump won 62 percent of the vote, compared to Hillary Clinton, who won 32 percent. \xa0\nIowa congressional race\n\n\n\n\n\nIf elected, state Rep. Abby Finkenauer would be the youngest woman elected to Congress at 28 years old. Finkenauer faces three Democratic primary challengers all in a bid to unseat Republican incumbent Rep. Rod Blum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Tim Reid)\n\n\n\nOne of several competitive races where Democrats are hoping to flip a seat is the 1st congressional district in Iowa.\nRep. Rod Blum, a Republican, faces a tough re-election campaign in what Fox News’ has labeled a toss-up election. He’s running unopposed in the primary, but a group of energized Democrats are vying to take him on in the general election. His seat is one targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nFor Democrats, state Rep. Abby Finkenauer, Thomas Heckroth, Army veteran George Ramsey and aerospace engineer Courtney Rowe will face off in Tuesday’s primary election.\nSeen as the frontrunner among Democrats, Finkenauer has already gotten the endorsements of EMILY’s List, NARAL and several state lawmakers. She has also raised the most money with nearly $1.3 million, the Des Moines Register reported. Finkenauer, 28, would be the youngest woman elected to Congress if she wins. (Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., became the youngest woman to be elected in 2014 at the age of 30.)\nThe Democratic Party is ready and welcoming a challenging race in November, especially after Trump’s election. Linn County Democratic Party Chairman Bret Nilles previously told Fox News that he’s seen “more enthusiasm since the election results than we had prior to” the presidential election.\nNilles also said he hopes Blum’s support for Trump will help Democrats in November. Trump won about 51 percent of the vote in Iowa in the 2016 election -- compared to Clinton’s 42 percent -- but according to the Des Moines Register, “no party” voters make up a huge difference in the 1st congressional district. About 32 percent of voters in the district are registered Democrats, 29 percent are Republicans and the rest aren’t affiliated with a party, the newspaper reported.\n"No Party" voters hold the secret to understanding why incumbents do well in the district and why a conservative Republican continues to win a district in which Democrats outnumber Republicans,” Christopher Larimer, a University of Northern Iowa political scientist, wrote in a book about the district, according to the Des Moines Register.\nBlum, 63, was first elected to the seat in 2014.\nNew Jersey Senate\n\n\n\n\n\nSen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is expected to hang onto his seat, but his recent corruption and bribery trial could play a big role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\n\n\nThis Senate seat is almost sure to remain safely in the hands of Democrats -- but expect Sen. Bob Menendez’s corruption and bribery case to play a big role.\nFox News’ ranks the New Jersey Senate race as “likely Democrat.”\nBrian Goldberg, a business owner, and Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, are facing off in the Republican primary Tuesday in an effort to take on Menendez. Hugin, who is expected to win the primary, has distanced himself from Trump. Goldberg, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in 2014, has embraced Trump, on the other hand -- even holding a “Supporters of President Trump Rally” in April.\nClinton took New Jersey with 55 percent of the vote; Trump won 41 percent.\nWhoever Menendez faces in the general, it’s sure to be a “nasty” election cycle, Peter Woolley, a Fairleigh Dickinson University politics professor, told The Morning Call newspaper.\n“When the candidates go negative before the primary is even held, you can look forward to more of the same in the general election," he said.\nMenendez faces a primary challenger in publisher Lisa McCormick who has said she’s running just to give New Jersey Democrats another option. He is expected to beat her in the primary.\nMenendez was accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence. His case ended in a mistrial last year after a jury failed to deliver a verdict. He was formally admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee earlier this year.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!” the president tweeted.\xa0\n\nAs has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2018\n\n\nMoments later, the president decried the investigation as "UNCONSTITUTIONAL" -- the latest swipe at Special Counsel Robert Mueller amid negotiations over a possible interview with the president.\xa0\n\n\nThe appointment of the Special Councel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2018\n\n\nTrump weighed in after legal team member Rudy Giuliani fielded numerous questions on the self-pardon scenario on the Sunday shows.\n“The president of the United States pardoning himself would just be unthinkable. And it would lead to probably an immediate impeachment,” he said bluntly on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn ABC’s “This Week,” Giuliani said Trump “probably” has the power to pardon himself but has “no intention” of doing so. \xa0\n\n\n\nThe questions followed a newly revealed January letter from Trump’s legal team to Mueller. The correspondence cited the president’s pardon powers, while making the case against a Trump interview with Mueller and claiming the president could not have obstructed justice because of his broad presidential powers.\nCounselor Kellyanne Conway said on “Fox & Friends” that the question of whether Trump may pardon himself is “ridiculous” because “you would pardon yourself if you’ve done something wrong.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump critics, though, have raised alarm that the president’s recent pardon of conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza and consideration of other acts of clemency are a signal he could exercise his pardon power in connection with the Russia meddling investigation.\nPreet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney who was fired by Trump, told CNN’s “State of the Union” that a self-pardon would be “outrageous.”\n“I think if the president decided that he was going to pardon himself, I think that it is almost self-executing impeachment,” he said, adding that the framers did not intend for a president to be able to self-pardon.\nTrump, meanwhile, used his Twitter account Monday to boast of accomplishments for an administration now 500 days into office. He touted tax cuts and border security measures, as well as health care measures even though they fell short of a full ObamaCare repeal.\nHe tweeted: “This is my 500th. Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days. Massive Tax & Regulation Cuts, Military & Vets, Lower Crime & Illegal Immigration, Stronger Borders, Judgeships, Best Economy & Jobs EVER, and much more … We had Repeal & Replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. Individual Mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. Drug prices coming down & Right to Try!”\n\nThis is my 500th.

President Trump has often decried athletes\' protests during the Star-Spangled Banner.\n                                    \n                                        \xa0(Reuters/Eduardo Munoz)\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\nFor football fans, it was a season filled with upsets, dramatic game-deciding calls from referees – and politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump set his sights on the National Football League during the 2017 season when he lashed out at athletes who protest the national anthem before games.\nThe response from the NFL and its players was swift and unavoidable as games brought opposing teams together, united against a common opponent: the president.\n\nRead on for a look at Trump\'s gripes with the sport.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nTrump scraps White House visit\nTrump announced\xa0June 4\xa0that the Philadelphia Eagles would not visit the White House to celebrate the team\'s Super Bowl win amid the national anthem dispute.\n\n\n\nTrump, in a statement, said the team is "unable" to visit the ceremony because they don\'t agree with his belief that NFL players should "proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country."\nThe Eagles apparently wanted to send a smaller group of players\xa0—\xa0as a handful\xa0did not plan to attend\xa0— but Trump seemingly uninvited the entire team.\xa0\nA group of 1,000 fans, however, are still invited to attend a "different type" of event, one which Trump said "will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem."\nTrump cheers on the NFL\nAfter the NFL decided players should stand for the national anthem or face a fine in the future, Trump praised the league, telling Fox News the team owners “did the right thing with that.”\nThe league has adopted a new policy which mandates that players and personnel have to “stand and show respect for the flag and the anthem” or be fined. Those who do not wish to stand for the national anthem can stay in the locker room “or in a similar location off the field” until it’s over, the NFL said.\n“I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem,” Trump said. “You shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe they shouldn’t be in the country.”\nTrump credited “the people” for enacting the policy change at the NFL. “I brought it out. I think the people pushed it forward,” he said.\nPost-game problems\nSeveral Philadelphia Eagles players said they would skip the customary White House visit even before Trump made the June 4 announcement.\xa0\nSafety Malcolm Jenkins confirmed to a WTXF-TV reporter\xa0in May that he would not be visiting the White House. And in April, defensive end Brandon Graham reportedly commented,\xa0"as of right now, I won\'t be there."\xa0\nPrior to their Super Bowl win, both defensive end Chris Long and wide receiver Torrey Smith -- who is now with the Carolina Panthers -- said they, too, wouldn’t attend the usual celebration at the White House should the invitation be extended.\xa0\n"We are in the process of working through the logistics of a trip to Washington D.C., including a visit to the White House on June 5," an Eagles spokesman told NFL.com on May 17.\xa0\nPre-game announcement\xa0\nIn a Super Bowl LII presidential message, Trump spoke about U.S. service members and standing for “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\nTrump said, “We owe these heroes the greatest respect for defending our liberty and our American way of life. Their sacrifice is stitched into each star and every stripe of our Star-Spangled Banner. We hold them in our hearts and thank them for our freedom as we proudly stand for the National Anthem.”\n\nA special message from President @realDonaldTrump about #SuperBowlSunday. 🇺🇸 #SBLII pic.twitter.com/TWgs2QB1kh— GOP (@GOP) February 4, 2018\n\n\nState of the NFL\nDuring Trump’s first State of the Union address – less than a week before Super Bowl LII – Trump seemingly took a jab at those who protest the national anthem.\nWhile acknowledging White House guest Preston Sharp, a young boy who organized a campaign to put American flags on veterans’ graves, Trump said he “reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.”\xa0\nTrump takes on Roger Goodell\nTrump said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell “lost control of the hemorrhaging league,” on Twitter.\n“Can you believe that the disrespect for our Country, our Flag, our Anthem continues without penalty to the players,” Trump said. “The Commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss!”\n\nCan you believe that the disrespect for our Country, our Flag, our Anthem continues without penalty to the players. The Commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss! https://t.co/udXP5MR8BC— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017\n\n\nMarshawn Lynch’s defense\nAfter Trump publicly criticized Oakland Raiders’ running back Marshawn Lynch on social media, his mother and his coach’s wife jumped to his defense.\nTrump said on Twitter that Lynch should be suspended for the remainder of the football season if he does what he did before a game: sit in protest during the playing of the national anthem but\xa0stand for Mexico’s anthem.\n\nMarshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2017\n\n\nDelisa Lynch, the football player’s mother, fired back, hitting the president for his past failures to become an NFL team owner.\n\nwhat NFL team do Trump own ? oh yeah they wouldnt let him have one ,!! LMAO https://t.co/1rPa5jfMjE— Delisa Lynch (@MommaLynch24) November 20, 2017\n\n\nAnd Linda Del Rio, the wife of Raiders Coach Jack Del Rio,\xa0reportedly said on Twitter, “President Trump I voted for you, which I now regret. Football is a powerful platform – here’s the charitable work we did in Mexico City #NFLproud.” Her account appears to have been deactivated.\nPence out of the game\nVice President Mike Pence attended the Indianapolis Colts game in his home state in October – but not for very long.\nPence and his wife\xa0walked out of the game\xa0after players from the San Francisco 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.\nTrump later tweeted that he was “proud” of Pence and his wife, Karen, for leaving the stadium.\n\nThe trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2017\n\n\nJerry Jones’ play call\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\xa0said his players must stand for the national anthem\xa0– if they don’t want to remain seated on the bench for the game.\n"I know this, we cannot ... in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag," Jones said after a team loss. “We know that there is a serious debate in this country about those issues, but there is no question in my mind that the National Football League and the Dallas Cowboys are going to stand up for the flag. So we\'re clear."\nWhen pressed on other signs of protest, such as players holding up a fist at the end of the song, Jones reiterated that “if there’s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then [they] will not play.”\nCowboys gain ground with Trump\nAlong with Jones,\xa0the Cowboys briefly knelt together\xa0before the national anthem. But when the “Star-Spangled Banner” played, the Cowboys stood with locked arms. The Arizona Cardinals did the same.\n“The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was the loudest I have ever heard. Great anger,” Trump tweeted.\n“But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem,” he continued. “Big progress being made – we all love our country.”\n\nThe booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017\n\n\n\nBut while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017\n\n\nTrump has said that he had spoken to Jones, calling him a “winner who knows how to get things done.” He also said athletes “will stand for our Country!”\xa0\n\nSpoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2017\n\n\nSarah Sanders takes a shot\nWhite House press secretary\xa0Sarah Sanders defended Trump’s comments on the NFL and its players, saying it’s “always appropriate for the President of the United States to defend our flag, to defend the national anthem and to defend the men and women who fought and died to defend it.”\nSanders also suggested athletes protest “the [police] officers on the field who are protecting them instead of the American flag.”\xa0\nRace versus respect\nTrump said that his issue with athletes’ protests was about “respect” for the U.S. and not race.\n“The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our country, flag and national anthem. NFL must respect this!” he said.\n\nThe issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2017\n\n\nBrady breaks Trump’s tackle\nDespite his oft-reported friendship with Trump, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said he\xa0disagreed with the president’s remarks on the NFL.\n“I certainly disagree with what he said. I thought it was just divisive,” Brady said.\nGame time decisions\n\n\n\n\n\nPittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle and former Army Ranger Alejandro Villanueva (78) stands outside the tunnel alone during the National Anthem before an NFL game against the Chicago Bears Sunday, Sept. 24 in Chicago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\n\n\nAfter the president’s speech and tweets, multiple NFL teams and players decided to take a stand – by taking a knee or remaining in the locker room during the Sept. 24 games.\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers, Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans all\xa0remained in their locker rooms\xa0while “The Star-Spangled Banner” played.\nSteelers head coach Mike Tomlin said the decision was made by the team “not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from this circumstance.” However, Alejandro Villanueva, an offensive tackle and former Army Ranger,\xa0was outside when the anthem began to play and stood alone.\nMultiple teams, including the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars, took a knee or locked arms during the national anthem.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh stands with his arms locked with his daughter and players during the playing of the National Anthem before their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\n\n\n\nAnd while the locked arms was meant to be a display of unity among NFL players, Trump tweeted his support for the gesture.\n"Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!" he said.\n\nGreat solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\n\n\nTrump tweeted a total of six times that Sunday about the American flag and protests.\nTrump tackles athlete protesters\nWhile in Alabama to campaign for a Republican special Senate election candidate, Trump took a moment to\xa0slam athletes who kneel in protest\xa0during the national anthem.\n"Wouldn\'t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say \'get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out, he\'s fired,\'" Trump said to cheers.\n“You know, the NFL ratings are down massively, massively,” Trump said as he railed against the league’s officiating on certain tackles. “A referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she’s so proud of him. They’re ruining the game.”\nTrump accused "those people taking a knee" during the anthem of "hurting" football and encouraged people to "leave the stadium" if just one player protests.\nBuffalo Bills come up short\nBefore he became president, Trump owned the\xa0New Jersey Generals of the now-defunct United States Football League (USFL). Trump pushed for the league\'s games to be played in the fall, in competition with the NFL, and was\xa0widely blamed for the collapse\xa0of the league.\nAfter the USFL folded in 1985, Trump unsuccessfully tried to become a NFL team owner.\nTrump lost a bidding war to become the Buffalo Bills\' new owner in 2014. He was outbid by Terry Pegula, 66,\xa0who reportedly paid\xa0$1.4 billion for the team.\nTrump decried the NFL and the team on Twitter multiple times after losing the ownership fight.\n“The [NFL] games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills. Boring games, too many flags, too soft!” Trump said on Oct. 13, 2014.\n\nEven though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner. Now that won’t happen.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2014\n\n\n\nThe @nfl games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills. Boring games, too many flags, too soft!— Donald J.

Johnson fled the country after his conviction, but he agreed years later to return and serve a 10-month jail sentence.\nHe died in 1946.\n\nIn recent years, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have called for Jackson to be pardoned. But it wasn’t until Thursday when Trump, who was intimately involved with the promotions of Mike Tyson fights in Atlantic City in the 1980s, issued the pardon.\nMcCain said he applauded Trump’s decision. “This action finally rights a historical wrong, restores a great athlete\'s legacy & closes a shameful chapter in our history,” he wrote.\n\nI applaud @POTUS for issuing a posthumous pardon of boxing legend Jack Johnson for his racially charged conviction a century ago. This action finally rights a historical wrong, restores a great athlete\'s legacy & closes a shameful chapter in our history. https://t.co/rDxInwgLrz— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 24, 2018\n\n\n“Jack Johnson! It’s about time,” former heavyweight champion George Foreman tweeted. “2 things he loved Boxing and America. Now he will be rewarded by both.”\n\nJack Johnson! It’s about time, 2 things he loved Boxing and America. Now he will be rewarded by both https://t.co/F5qaZ8Qi43— George Foreman (@GeorgeForeman) May 24, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n“Thank you one and all,” actor Sylvester Stallone, who attended the White House ceremony and urged Trump to consider the pardon, said on Instagram. “Justice has been done! Keep punching.”\n\n    Thank you one and all! Justice has been done! Keep punching A post shared by  Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on May 24, 2018 at 11:00am PDT\n\n\nCurrent WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder, who joined Stallone and former champion Lennox Lewis at the White House Thursday, labeled Johnson “a pioneer, not just in this sport, but for African-Americans throughout the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The things that he had to endure, made it possible for me and my family to live the lives we lead today," Wilder said in a statement provided to Fox News. “Everything we do in this sport is in honor of the legacy that he left behind. In many ways, we’re still fighting that same fight that Johnson fought a century ago. We have to continue to try to speak truth to power and keep pushing towards a better tomorrow despite rhetoric that’s meant to split us apart. Hopefully this pardon is something symbolic that can help unify, but the most important thing we can do is stay engaged every day and live our values so that our culture doesn’t repeat these mistakes.”\nDocumentary filmmaker Ken Burns, who made a much lauded film about the former champion, said the “pardon reminds us of a racist past and how even today racist remarks and coded words are used to imperil African Americans and to advance an Un-American agenda.”\n\nJack Johnson pardon reminds us of a racist past and how even today racist remarks and coded words are used to imperil African Americans and to advance an Un-American agenda.

Sign up\xa0here.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the roster:\xa0Dems start to get serious about 2020 - Time Out:\xa0‘Since we\'re together, we might as well say…’ - Koch group boosts Heitkamp - Ryan running point on bid to block tariffs - Who has three thumbs and needs a lawyer? **This guy**\nDEMS START TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT 2020 Figuring out who your party should run for president is like trying to pack your bags for a trip to an unknown destination.\xa0\n\nHistory affords lots of opportunities to see parties botch these questions. Our personal favorite is how Democrats were\xa0certain\xa0that the way back from their 2004 presidential defeat was to find moderates who could connect with “NASCAR dads.”\xa0\nHaving concluded that\xa0George W. Bush\xa0had won re-election by hoodwinking blue-collar voters by deploying wedge social issues – “God, guns and gays” – Democrats set out to do the same. The presumptive frontrunners were Sen.\xa0Mark Warner, D-Va., and Sen.\xa0Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y.\xa0\nNot only were they deemed sufficiently hawkish to compete in an era of strong national security concerns but also had the ability – or in the case of Clinton had a spouse with the ability – to connect with middle-class Americans.\xa0\n\n\n\nNot mentioned: The African American Senate candidate from Illinois who would go on to amass one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate and launch his national political career with a speech at an anti-war rally.\xa0\nEight years later, Republicans did Democrats one better. They had concluded that the reason for their 2012 loss was due to insufficient outreach and accommodation for young voters, minority voters and female voters.\xa0\nThe Republican National Committee even ordered up a report memorializing those obvious conclusions. If you ever want to give yourself a good laugh, go back now and take a look at the so-called autopsy that party elders prepared. As you read it imagine the gif of a smirking\xa0Donald Trump\xa0mugging for cameras at the first presidential debate of that cycle.\xa0\nDemocrats’ quandary for the current presidential cycle is tougher than either of those. Not only were they the victims of the most shocking political upset in generations in 2016, but they can’t come to terms with the reasons for their defeat.\xa0\nFor Republicans, those who deny that interference by Russian agents and then-FBI Director James Comey\xa0played parts in Trump’s victory are naïve or willfully obtuse. Meanwhile Democrats overstate the importance of these factors, as well as the deficiencies of their nominee.\xa0\nYes, Hillary Clinton was the worst major party nominee in decades. And yes, her shortcomings were compounded by outside forces. But there were other factors at play too.\xa0\nDemocrats misunderstood – and still misunderstand – the demographic shape of the electorate and underestimated the enthusiasm among white working-class voters for radical change, even if it carried with it risk.\xa0\nIt is against this confused backdrop that the Blue Team is taking the first tentative steps toward picking their man or woman for 2020. You would have to say former Vice President\xa0Joe Biden\xa0is the frontrunner if he really is serious about running. Similarly, 2016 primary runner-up Sen.\xa0Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is undeniably close behind.\xa0\nThen there is a whole second tier to consider, including billionaire\xa0gadfly\xa0Tom Steyer, who is using his resources to assemble a mighty list by enticing Democrats to sign some symbolic petition about impeachment. You would also have to put rising star Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in these ranks; as well as her counterpart from Massachusetts, Sen.\xa0Elizabeth Warren.\xa0\nThe wildcard so far for Democrats is former Attorney General\xa0Eric Holder, who this week was dipping some digits in the cool waters of the New Hampshire primary.\xa0\nWe continue to be more bullish than most on Holder’s chances for a couple of reasons. First, he has the admiration of the party’s activist base while still remaining palatable to the more moderate corporate donor core. But more importantly, aside from Biden, he has the best claim to the legacy of\xa0Barack Obama.\xa0\nJust as Republican affection for the 43rd\xa0president grew strongly in the era of Obama, Democratic nostalgia for Obama is intensifying. And we haven’t even gotten to the part where Obama opens his presidential library and generally starts building out his post-presidential profile. When former first lady\xa0Michelle Obama’s book comes out, they’ll be swooning in the aisles of Barnes & Noble.\nNow, before Republican readers tell us what a bad choice Holder would be to oppose Trump in 2020, remember that the Red Team knows almost as little about the shape of things 30 months from now as Democrats do.\xa0\nObama looked like an easy out to Republicans when he started his run in 2007, but that was before the Bush administration hit bottom along with the world financial markets.\xa0\nThe moral of the story for presidential nominating contests since time immemorial is that political activists are as bad at predicting the future as anyone else.\xa0\nObama and Trump looked like weak choices when they started to run. But both revealed themselves to be canny candidates and, more importantly, the climate in which they were running changed dramatically as they went.\xa0\nTHE RULEBOOK: JUDGE NOT LEST YE JUDGE YOURSELF\xa0\xa0 “No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause, or in any cause in respect to which he has the least interest or bias.” –\xa0Alexander Hamilton,\xa0Federalist No. 80\nTIME OUT:\xa0‘SINCE WE\'RE TOGETHER, WE MIGHT AS WELL SAY…’ Time:\xa0“It’s been a big year for Mister Rogers… later this summer,\xa0Maxwell King’s\xa0The Good Neighbor: The Life and Work of\xa0Fred Rogers\xa0will add to that list, as the first full-length biography of the television icon. To celebrate June 1, which is Children’s Day in many countries around the world, here’s a sneak peek at the first pages of that book … ‘Rogers said he wanted no children — absolutely none — to be present when he appeared on The\xa0Oprah Winfrey\xa0Show in Chicago. No children? How could that be? … But Fred Rogers knew himself far better than even friends like [David Newell], who had worked with him for decades. He knew that if there were children in the studio audience, he wouldn’t focus on Winfrey’s questions, he wouldn’t pay heed to her legion of viewers, and he wouldn’t convey the great importance of his work. The children and their needs would come first. He couldn’t help it, never could help it.”  Flag on the play? -\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\xa0with your tips, comments or questions.\nSCOREBOARD Trump job performance\xa0 Average approval:\xa040.8 percent\xa0 Average disapproval:\xa054.2 percent\xa0 Net Score:\xa0-13.4 points Change from one week ago:\xa0down 0.6 points\xa0 [Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; IBD: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]  Control of House Republican average:\xa041.8 percent Democratic average:\xa048.4 percent Advantage:\xa0Democrats plus 6.6 points Change from one week ago:\xa0no change\xa0 [Average includes: CNN: 47% Dems - 44% GOP; CBS News: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; Pew Research Center: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Monmouth University: 49% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP.]  KOCH GROUP BOOSTS HEITKAMP Roll Call: “In an unusual move, Americans for Prosperity is launching digital ads on Friday thanking a vulnerable Democratic senator for sponsoring legislation that rolls back Dodd-Frank regulations. The ad campaign, first reported by CNBC, thanks North Dakota Sen.\xa0Heidi Heitkamp, who’s running for re-election in a state that President Donald Trump won by 36 points in 2016. Heitkamp will likely face Rep.\xa0Kevin Cramer\xa0in November. Inside Elections with\xa0Nathan L. Gonzales\xa0rates the race a Tossup. Earlier this spring, the conservative political network backed by the Koch brothers ran ads attacking Heitkamp for voting against the Republican tax plan. ‘While we don’t agree with Sen. Heitkamp on everything, particularly her vote against tax relief, we commend her for taking a stand against the leaders of her party to do the right thing,’ AFP President\xa0Tim Phillips\xa0said in a statement.”\nRyan still raising -\xa0Dayton Daily News: “House Speaker\xa0Paul Ryan\xa0raised around $700,000 for House Republicans during a swing through Ohio, including a private event in the Dayton area [Thursday]. Ryan was at an undisclosed private home [Thursday] and had events near Cincinnati and Columbus.\xa0Republicans insisted the fundraisers in Dayton and Cincinnati were for House Republicans in general, not Congressmen\xa0Mike Turner\xa0and\xa0Steve Chabot\xa0specifically. The Republican incumbents are facing Democratic opposition in the fall. The swing culminated Thursday in stop not far from Miami University, where Ryan went to school and got his political start volunteering for retired Speaker\xa0John Boehner.”  Estes v. Estes -\xa0The Wichita Eagle: “U.S. Rep.\xa0Ron Estes\xa0has a Republican primary opponent. His name is\xa0Ron Estes. Ron Estes — not the congressman, the other one — said Thursday he plans to run against the better-known Estes. The nonelected Estes, who filed as Ron M. Estes, lives in Wichita and is a first-time candidate. He said in a statement he is running because ‘our status quo elected leaders’ refuse to represent the congressional district by avoiding town halls and constituents. His campaign website calls him ‘The Real Ron Estes.’ … Both candidates have filed to run with the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office. ‘This is clearly an attempt to deceive Kansas voters,’ said Rep. Ron Estes spokesman\xa0Josh Bell.”\nState senator steps up to run after Virginia Republican suddenly steps down -\xa0Richmond Times-Dispatch: “Sen.\xa0Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, said Thursday night that he is ‘making myself available’ to run for the seat of retiring Rep.\xa0Tom Garrett, R-5th. Stanley’s 9 p.m. Facebook post came hours after Sen.\xa0Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, announced that he was passing up a bid for the seat. The 5th District Republican Committee will meet at 10 a.m. Saturday at Nelson County High School to pick a nominee to succeed Garrett. … Stanley said in the Facebook post: … ‘As the former 5th District chairman, I love this district, the rank and file of its members and the grassroots that have made it one of the most conservative congressional districts in the nation.’”\nDemocratic House candidate likens trump to bin Laden -\xa0WaPo: “The White House on Thursday denounced a campaign ad produced by a Democrat seeking the nomination to challenge Rep.\xa0Barbara Comstock\xa0(R-Va.) that compared President Trump to\xa0Osama bin Laden. The ad flashes an image of bin Laden followed by one of the White House as the candidate, Army veteran\xa0Dan Helmer, says, ‘After 9/11, the greatest threat to our democracy lived in a cave; today he lives in the White House.’ Helmer uses the line in nearly every public appearance, but the 30-second spot, slated to air on broadcast television from Thursday until the June 12 primary, provoked a response from the Trump administration.”  RYAN RUNNING POINT ON BID TO BLOCK TARIFFS\xa0 CBS News: “Speaker of the House\xa0Paul Ryan\xa0came out in opposition to\xa0President Trump\'s decision to move ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, saying the move ‘targets America\'s allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of China.’ The Trump administration announced Thursday it will be moving ahead with the tariffs on ally nations, despite those nations\' urging that he not do so, and fears of retaliatory tariffs. Commerce Secretary\xa0Wilbur Ross\xa0said Thursday the U.S. will impose the 25 percent tariffs on steel imports, and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, when a previous exemption expires at midnight. Mr. Trump originally proposed the tariffs in March, but deferred them as negotiations continued. Ryan, joining some fellow Republicans like Nebraska Sen.\xa0Ben Sasse, said in a statement Thursday afternoon that he disagrees with the administration\'s decision.”  Navarro says the tariffs are about ‘national security’ -\xa0Fox Business: “White House National Trade Council Director\xa0Peter Navarro\xa0said national security is the primary reason behind ending the two-month exemption from U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs for Europe, Canada and Mexico. ‘This particular action on steel and aluminum is not about unfair trade practices. It\'s about national security… without an aluminum steel industry, we don\'t have a country,’ Navarro said during a FOX Business interview on the ‘After the Bell’ program on Thursday. Navarro added that imposing tariffs on the nation\'s closest allies is an opportunity to create jobs. ‘All we are trying to do here with the 232 tariffs is to provide our domestic industries an opportunity to earn a decent rate of return and invest in this country,’ he said.”\nAdministration will cite security to force purchase of coal, nuclear power -\xa0Bloomberg: “Trump administration officials are making plans to order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal and nuclear plants in an effort to extend their life, a move that could represent an unprecedented intervention into U.S. energy markets. The Energy Department would exercise emergency authority under a pair of federal laws to direct the operators to purchase electricity or electric generation capacity from at-risk facilities, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The agency also is making plans to establish a \'Strategic Electric Generation Reserve\' with the aim of promoting the national defense and maximizing domestic energy supplies.”\nREPORT: MCCABE MAY FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES Fox News: “Former FBI Director\xa0James Comey\xa0was recently questioned by the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s office as part of a probe into whether\xa0Andrew McCabe, his former deputy, committed a crime by lying to federal agents, a Thursday report claimed. The Washington Post report indicated that McCabe, whom Attorney General\xa0Jeff Sessions\xa0fired earlier this year just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension, could be charged criminally, according to a person familiar with the matter. McCabe was fired after the Justice Department\'s watchdog said he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of\xa0Hillary Clinton’s email server. Justice Department Inspector General\xa0Michael Horowitz\xa0said McCabe had not been forthcoming in regard to the handling of the FBI’s probe. Horowitz said McCabe misled both investigators and Comey, multiple times, about a media disclosure authorization. Horowitz then passed those findings to the U.S. attorney’s office to decide if a criminal charge was necessary, although a referral doesn’t mean charges will be filed.”\nWarner connects\xa0Trump’s pardons to witnesses in investigation -\xa0The Hill: “Sen.\xa0Mark Warner\xa0(D-Va.) suggested on Thursday that President Trump may be seeking to send a message to witnesses in the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia by issuing a flurry of pardons. ‘The President’s ad hoc use of the pardon power is concerning enough,’ Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted. ‘But the possibility that he may also be sending a message to witnesses in a criminal investigation into his campaign is extremely dangerous. In the United States of America, no one is above the law.’ Warner\'s tweet came hours after Trump pardoned conservative writer\xa0Dinesh D\'Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to making illegal campaign contributions.”\nTrump grouses about price of probe -\xa0Fox News:\xa0“President Trump\xa0on Friday blasted the cost of Special Counsel\xa0Robert Mueller’s investigation, after a new filing revealed taxpayers have spent nearly $17 million on the Russia probe. ‘A.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!’ Trump tweeted.\xa0The price tag was revealed in a spending report released Thursday by the Justice Department. About $10 million was spent between October and March, the document states. That includes $4.5 million spent by Mueller’s team and another $5.5 million spent by the Justice Department on other expenditures attributable to the investigations. ‘The department will continue to dedicate and leverage resources to maintain strong program and financial management controls,’ the DOJ said in the report. ‘Management takes its program and financial accountability seriously and is dedicated to ensuring that funds are used in a responsible and transparent manner.’”  PLAY-BY-PLAY Trump says Singapore summit with Kim is back on after meeting with NoKo official\xa0-\xa0Fox News  Trump admin making plans to save coal power plants\xa0-\xa0Bloomberg\nUnemployment numbers stays at 17-year low -\xa0AP\nReport: Pruitt spent $1,560 on customized fountain pens\xa0-\xa0WaPo  Trudeau says no to\xa0NAFTA deal because of five-year sunset clause\xa0-\xa0WaPo  AUDIBLE: OH YOU SWEET TALKER “This individual will have the capacity as lieutenant governor to serve in a high level of management and efficiency, and that’s what our state needs.” –\xa0Kansas Republican gubernatorial candidate\xa0Jim Barnett\xa0announcing that he had selected his wife,\xa0Rosie, to be his running mate.\nANY GIVEN SUNDAY This Sunday Mr. Wallace will sit down with former Trump Campaign Manager,\xa0Corey Lewandowski.

Is Hawley still deteriorating from association/will he continue to? Also why did Greitens use taxpayer-funded lawyers to fight for his innocence but then abruptly resign when the chargers were dropped? Swamp level: stinky.” –\xa0Jack Whiteman,\xa0St. Louis  [Ed. note: Greitens’ departure is unambiguously good news for Hawley. Even in the most favorable light of Hawley being seen as standing up to corruption, the story is still a net-negative. We assume that Greitens’ replacement, the pride of Polk County, Gov.\xa0Mike Parson, will not have anything nearly so interesting to say or do as his predecessor. Presumably, state issues will now recede in Missouri, and that’s a very good thing for Hawley. Everything that Hawley can do to make this a national race will help him. If he can get voters thinking about generic Republicans and generic Democrats, Hawley will win with a walk-off in bright red Missouri. Sen.\xa0Claire McCaskill, on the other hand, needs the race to be about Missouri and about her accomplishments – ways in which she is different from national Democrats. You know, you really got me thinking, Mr. Whiteman, that I need to get out there and see the race first hand. I’ll be particularly interested to assess voter attitudes in the 700 block Clark Avenue in St. Louis…]  “Chris, It is duly noted that you told us about choking on your gum while walking into the studio to record your podcast the day before citing a scientific study about chewing gum and walking in the Halftime Report.

WHO HAS THREE THUMBS AND NEEDS A LAWYER? **THIS GUY** AP: “Federal authorities say a Delaware man snapped a selfie before stealing part of a $4.5 million statue at a Philadelphia museum. According to an arrest affidavit filed Friday, 24-year-old\xa0Michael Rohana\xa0was attending an Ugly Sweater Party at the Franklin Institute Dec. 21 when he entered the ‘Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor’ exhibit. Authorities say Rohana took photos while posing next to a statue known as ‘The Cavalryman,’ and then snapped off the statue’s left thumb.\xa0Museum staff noticed the missing thumb Jan. 8, and the FBI traced it to Rohana five days later. It is unclear if he has legal representation. A museum spokeswoman says the statue will be repaired. She says a security contractor did not follow standard procedures the night of the alleged theft.”\nChris Stirewalt\xa0is the politics editor for Fox News.\xa0Brianna McClelland\xa0contributed to this report.

"We\'d urge the Justice Department to re-evaluate, to acknowledge they made a mistake. It\'s a waste of $20 million of the taxpayers\' money. The whole thing is already a waste of money."\n\n" ... (T)he whole thing was a mistake and should never have happened. ... It\'s a waste of $20 million of the taxpayers\' money. The whole thing is already a waste of money."\n- Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s legal team may take what they learn to the Justice Department in hopes of stymieing the ongoing special counsel probe.\n\n\n\nTrump has dubbed the reported informant digging around during his presidential campaign as a “spy,” and said “it could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president has also made unproven claims of FBI misconduct and political bias.\nComey has stood by his decision to share details from one of his memos with a friend in hopes of getting it to the news media, and contends he has done nothing wrong.\nIf Giuliani files any complaints, they would presumably fall on the desk of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last year following Comey’s ousting. Rosenstein was also present for Thursday\'s briefings.\nThe FBI and Justice Department on Thursday held a pair of high-level briefings for lawmakers in an effort to ease Republican pressure over the Russia investigation, amid Trump’s outcry over revelations that a confidential informant made contact with several of his advisers during the 2016 campaign.\n"What motivated putting him in? What sort of information were they seeking from him? What did they get?" Giuliani asked Friday. "They clearly did not get incriminating information or we\'d have found out about it by now. And why did they hide it for so long? There\'s a big concealment that went on here for over a year since the president said he had been surveilled."\n\n"What did they get? They clearly did not get incriminating information or we\'d have found out about it by now."\n- Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump\n\nSo far, 19 people, including Trump\'s former campaign chairman and former national security adviser, have been charged in Mueller\'s investigation. Three former Trump aides have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the investigation.\nFollowing the meetings -- which were initially offered to Republicans, but expanded to include an afternoon session for bipartisan members of Congress -- Democrats claimed they saw no evidence to believe that the FBI acted inappropriately.\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was not in the meetings but, in a radio interview Friday, broke with the president to say a "confidential informant is not a spy," though he cautioned about investigations into campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of a White House lawyer, Emmet Flood, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, alarmed Democrats at the briefing over concerns the officials would share information from the meetings for Trump’s legal advantage. But Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said both left “as planned before the substantive portion of the meeting began,” and "were there to relay the president\'s desire for as much openness as possible under the law.”\nGiuliani said it would be appropriate for Trump to be briefed on the findings.\n"He\'s not the subject or target of that investigation. He should know what is discussed," said Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and a former federal prosecutor. "Moreover, I assume President Obama knew about it. And if Obama knew about it, why can\'t Trump?"\n\n"(I)f Obama knew about it, why can\'t Trump?"\n- Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump\n\nGiuliani also said the president would wait to decide on whether to sit down for an interview with Mueller until after they have seen a report on the briefings.\nThe White House has yet to provide any evidence to support Trump’s claim that President Barack Obama\'s administration was trying to spy on his 2016 campaign for political reasons – and it remained unclear whether any spying took place.\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., an ardent Trump supporter, originally demanded the information on an FBI source in the Russia investigation.\nLate Sunday, the DOJ asked its watchdog to investigate whether there was inappropriate surveillance.\n"If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action," Rosenstein said in a statement announcing the move.\nFox News’ Alex Pappas, Jake Gibson and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\nBenjamin Brown is a reporter for Fox News.

Mitch McConnell announces plans to cancel August recess\nMajority Leader McConnell announces plans to cancel most of the August recess; Mike Emanuel reports from Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he’s canceled most of the chamber\'s traditional August recess, citing Democrats\' "obstruction" and the need to pass spending bills.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a brief written statement, he said: “Senators should expect to remain in session in August to pass legislation, including appropriations bills, and to make additional progress on the president’s nominees.”\nMcConnell\'s announcement had been expected, as he\'s faced pressure for weeks from fellow Republicans to keep members in session over the hot summer stretch.\xa0\n\nTheir appeal focused on the need to wrap up spending bills and confirm President Trump’s nominees to various positions. McConnell cited exactly that in his statement Tuesday.\xa0\n"Due to the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats of the president’s nominees, and the goal of passing appropriations bills prior to the end of the fiscal year, the August recess has been canceled," McConnell said.\xa0\nBut the decision also keeps lawmakers in Washington during a critical period in the runup to November\'s midterm elections -- a controversial move.\n\n\n\nOn one hand, the recess cancellation allows senators of both parties to show they\'re working hard. But Democrats may suggest there’s an ulterior motive -- as it keeps several endangered members of their party off the campaign trail.\nRepublicans hold a narrow, 51-49 seat edge in the Senate. In a strange electoral alignment, however, the overwhelming majority of seats up for election this year are held by Democrats -- many in states President Trump won.\xa0\nSens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. and others are considered vulnerable this election cycle, and could suffer from time off the campaign trail.\xa0\nAt the same time, Congress is facing very real deadlines.\xa0\nCongress and the president must come to terms with the next round of spending before Sept. 30. Democrats and Republicans are working feverishly behind the scenes to reach an accord before then.\xa0\nBut another factor could scramble the appropriations process. Republicans recently cobbled together a “rescissions” bill, which cancels spending Congress already allocated. The administration recently sent an updated version of that plan to Capitol Hill.\xa0\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has warned that the rescissions effort “is going to make it harder to get the appropriations process moving forward in a bipartisan way.”\xa0\nSchumer said Tuesday, though, that Democrats welcome the additional time to work on urgent matters in Washington – and called on Trump to stay in D.C. along with Congress.\xa0\nNot all is lost for senators, aides and other Capitol denizens hoping to relax. McConnell\'s office said senators will likely be on a break for the first full week of August before returning for the rest of the month.\nFox News\' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

And he argued that the investigation has moved beyond its original intent to include the business dealings of the president’s business associates.\n“This is rigged, you’ve got 13 Democrats, no collusion,” Giuliani said. “They are focused on things that didn\'t happen.”\nHe also said the president is "not going to fire anybody" because that would make him look like a victim.\nGiuliani also said that the former administration should have informed Trump that it was looking at Russia meddling during the 2016 race and was surveilling his campaign.\n“Some of it is Mueller\'s fault (but) it completely taints his investigation,” Giuliani said.\xa0“The whole thing with this investigation that was going on, which we consider spying, was done before Mueller got involved. But it completely taints his investigation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\nThe "Right to Try" bill allows terminally ill patients to request access to experimental medicines that have passed Phase 1 of the Food and Drug Administration approval process.\n\n\n\nIt authorizes patients diagnosed with life-ending illnesses to use unapproved medications — so long as they have undergone early testing on humans and are under continual evaluation. Patients also would have to have tried other treatment options.\n\'RIGHT TO TRY\' BILL HEADS TO TRUMP\'S DESK AFTER HOUSE OK\nIn August, the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent.\n“The Senate took a strong stand in support of the millions of Americans and their families suffering from terminal illness,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said in a statement following the vote. “Patients with terminal diseases ought to have a right to access treatments that have demonstrated a level of safety and could potentially save their lives.”\n"Right to Try" laws were already enacted in 40 states by the time the bill was passed, according to\xa0righttotry.org. Supporters called for federal legislation.\n"FDA regulations cannot preempt state laws that preserve constitutionally protected rights, such as the fundamental right to life and medical self-preservation," the website explained. "The United States Supreme Court has never addressed Right To Try specifically, but it has held that states have great latitude in regulating health and safety, including medical standards, which are primarily and historically a matter of local concern."\nFox News\' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

But during a feisty hearing Wednesday, federal Judge Kimba Wood said the lawyer -- who has been a fixture on CNN and other outlets -- would have to first stop his “publicity tour.”\xa0\nThe show, it appears, will go on.\xa0\n\nAfter the hearing, Avenatti withdrew his motion to intervene -- at least until the court rules whether Daniels is allowed to participate in the case.\xa0\nJudge Wood had warned him about the "publicity tour," since he would be subject to New York laws and procedures if he were allowed on the case -- meaning he\'d have to pull back on his attacks against Cohen.\xa0\nAvenatti has made countless appearances on cable outlets blasting President Trump and Cohen while defending his client, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\xa0\n\n\n\nCohen and Avenatti -- as well as attorneys for Trump and federal prosecutors -- appeared in federal court on Wednesday for the hearing related to the April 9\xa0FBI raid of Cohen’s personal properties.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCohen\'s attorneys fought to keep Avenatti out of the case, citing a California State Bar investigation\xa0into him.\n“I’ve never seen an attorney conduct himself in a manner that Avenatti has,” Cohen’s attorney Stephen Ryan said in court Wednesday, arguing that Avenatti’s promotion of Cohen’s bank records and other materials earlier this month was “reckless and improper.” Earlier this month, Avenatti tweeted bombshell allegations against Cohen, citing financial records to accuse him of receiving $500,000 from a Russian oligarch-tied company, as well as other dealings. The records suggest Cohen\'s firm was paid huge sums for insight into the Trump administration.\nEarlier this month, Avenatti also filed the motion to participate in the Cohen case.\xa0\nJudge Wood did not rule whether Avenatti could intervene in the case.\xa0\nIn court, meanwhile, Avenatti suggested he received a call from a member of the press last week for comment on audio recordings between Daniels’ former attorney Keith Davidson and Cohen. Avenatti argued that the two exchanged privileged information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Cohen’s attorney said he was unaware of the release of any audio file, noting that if it had been released, they would be “everywhere” and that “if” the audio files existed, they would be “under lock and key at my law firm.”\nFollowing the hearing, Avenatti also said that Cohen\'s attorneys had "audio tapes" of Cohen and the president, with some of the recordings "relating to my client."\xa0\n"Mr. Cohen and his attorney Mr. Ryan should release all of those audio recordings to the American people and to Congress," Avenatti said, suggesting if the recordings did relate to Daniels, it could be a violation of attorney-client privilege.\xa0\nCohen is under criminal investigation as part of a grand jury probe into his personal business dealings. One topic at issue is Cohen’s payment of $130,000 to Daniels weeks before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.\nThe president filed a financial disclosure earlier this month which included confirmation that he reimbursed Cohen for unspecified “expenses” -- apparently the payment to Daniels.\nPrior to the release of the disclosure, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that Trump reimbursed Cohen the $130,000 he paid to Daniels.\xa0\nThe judge in the case last month appointed independent special master Barbara Jones to review the material seized in the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s properties. The judge ruled Wednesday that Cohen’s attorneys’ review of the materials must be concluded by June 15, or the remaining materials will be sent to a team of lawyers not connected to the case.\nFox News’ Jennifer Oliva and Tara Prindiville contributed to this report.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Bush on \'Fox News @ Night with Shannon Bream.\'\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump blamed Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday for the ongoing “Russian Witch Hunt Hoax,” noting that he “would have quickly picked someone else” as the nation\'s chief law officer if he knew of Sessions’ decision to “recuse himself.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president suggested that Sessions, who was involved in the Trump campaign, “knew better than most that there was No Collusion.”\n“The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself…I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined…and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.\n\n\nThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018\n\n\nThe president’s tweet is just the latest blow to Sessions. Last week, Trump said he wished he had appointed someone else to lead the Justice Department, following comments made by House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who suggested there “are lots of really good lawyers in the country. He could have picked someone else.”\nTrump quoted Gowdy’s remarks, and concluded: “And I wish I did!”\nTrump has been highly critical of Sessions ever since his recusal, blasting the former senator for not launching full-blown investigations into Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and officials like fired FBI Director James Comey and fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n\n\n\nUpon Sessions’ recusal, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took control of the Russia probe, ultimately appointing Mueller to investigate allegations of potential collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\nLast month, the president demanded that the Justice Department investigate revelations that an FBI informant was in communication with at least three Trump campaign associates — George Papadopoulos, Sam Clovis, and Carter Page. The president has dubbed these new revelations as “Spygate.”\nRosenstein instructed the Justice Department inspector general to investigate any alleged “impropriety or political motivation” in the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates.\n\nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

It\'s so sought after it crashed the White House gift shop website.\n\n\n\n\nCollectors jumping on Thursday’s news that President Trump canceled his long-anticipated meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un crashed the White House Gift Shop website trying to buy the post-summit coin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gift shop was selling the “unique heirloom of political history” for $19.95 and was even offering a refund initially if the June 12 summit didn’t end up taking place, according to the\xa0New York Post. The coin was going for a robust $24.95 before the cancellation was revealed.\n“Most supporters have said they want this heirloom of political history regardless of outcome,” the shop said on its website, according to\xa0BBC.\n\nThe website was up and running as of Friday afternoon.\nThe commemorative item features the silhouettes of Trump, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, according to the gift shop website. The coin comes in a black velvet case with a plastic protective cover set. \xa0\nThe White House has said it didn’t create the coin and the gift shop notes that the token is different from the one created by the White House Communications Agency.\n\n\n\nNow, with Trump telling reporters Friday that the summit might be back on after all, it’s unclear what the value of the coin could possibly be.\nA quick scan of eBay and Amazon yielded no results of anyone selling the challenge coin.\n\nRyan Gaydos is an editor for Fox News.

Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Wednesday to reporters in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Rick Santorum appears behind an effort by conservative groups to try during the 2018 midterms to repel and replace ObamaCare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nHe spoke one day after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said ObamaCare premiums were projected to increase next year by an average 15 percent, in part because of the repeal of the law’s individual mandate. The mandate imposed a tax penalty on Americans who failed to buy health insurance.\n\n\n\nThe full details of the new repeal-replace effort by the coalition -- known as the Health Policy Consensus Group -- are expected to be released soon, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nHowever, the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, which has helped spearhead the effort, has already put out a “path forward” document on health care in 2018 that appears to be the legislative blueprint.\nThe highlights include lowering costs and improving patient choices, giving states wide flexibility in offering plans, and establishing “federal guardrails” so Americans can choose private coverage if they don’t like the state options. \xa0\nThe foundation also says the “new path” would build on the reform plan offered last year by GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Dean Heller of Nevada.\nThe plan is also reportedly backed by former Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Rick Santorum and was crafted with the help of the American Enterprise Institute and the Galen Institute.\nSources said last week that the plan would include financial help to low-income residents, an effort that could help garner some Democratic support, especially from senators facing re-election in swing states or conservative-leaning ones.\nYet supporters will also face the challenge of getting Republican leaders of the GOP-controlled Senate to vote on such legislation, considering the chamber has repeatedly failed to pass such legislation after it has cleared the House.\n“Lawmakers don’t like to own failure,” said one source familiar with the effort.\nThe GOP leaders have also indicated that they don’t intend to address any more major legislation during the midterms.\nRepublicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate. Democrats will have to win some 23 seats to take control of the House.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

But then President Trump took it a step further yesterday. So there is clearly an aggressive strategy in place to attack the Mueller investigation and claim broad powers for the president to resist any effort to interview or subpoena him.\nHow much of this is saber-rattling and how much is active resistance is hard to determine. But the ramped-up rhetoric clearly has the press up in arms.\n\nOn ABC’s “This Week,” George Stephanopoulos asked Rudy Giuliani if the president has the power to pardon himself.\n“He’s not, but he probably does,” Giuliani said. “He has no intention of pardoning himself.”\nChuck Todd asked the same question on “Meet the Press.” “Well, it\'s not going to happen,” Giuliani said. “So it’s a hypothetical point. I think the presidential power, there\'s nothing that limits the presidential power of pardon from a federal crime—not a state crime. President Trump is not going to do that.”\n\n\n\nThose didn’t seem like particularly inflammatory answers, but the press was on fire with “TRUMP COULD PARDON HIMSELF” headlines, even though his lawyer said it’s not happening.\nNow Rudy could have deflected it entirely as a hypothetical not worth answering, but the former prosecutor enjoys the back-and-forth.\nThe other part of the Sunday interviews dealt with the Trump team memo to Bob Mueller, leaked to the New York Times, asserting that the president can’t commit obstruction of justice because he can fire anyone in the executive branch. Therefore, the lawyers argued, he could blow off a Mueller subpoena to testify.\nGiuliani didn’t go quite that far, saying: “I look at the obstruction part of the argument this way, he didn\'t obstruct. And we can win it on the facts. So, he wants to testify. Every lawyer he has, including this one, always wants their client not to testify.”\nGiuliani also cited a previous DOJ opinion that a sitting president can’t be indicted.\nBut what really opened the floodgates was a separate interview with the Huffington Post.\n“If he shot James Comey, he\'d be impeached the next day,” Giuliani said. “Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him.”\nOkay, he really stepped in it. Of course it was an analogy based on an extreme example, but Giuliani allowed the president’s detractors to say his people were claiming he had the right to commit murder.\n“Literally out of a tyrant’s playbook,” Joe Scarborough said.\n(On his new prime-time show, CNN\'s Chris Cuomo asked Giuliani whether he regretted making the eye-popping comment about shooting Comey. Giuliani laughed, said that was the hypothetical question he was asked and called the notion "totally ridiculous.")\nAnd then the president took to the Twitter.\nCiting “numerous legal scholars,” Trump said: “I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?”\nThat of course escalated the story—now it wasn’t just Rudy on talk shows—and the president followed up with this:\n“The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!”\nI see no evidence of any unconstitutionality. Trump’s own deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Mueller under existing DOJ procedures and has said he is staying within his mandate.\nThere used to be a debate over the constitutionality of the old independent counsel law, but Congress let that die more than a decade ago.\nSo why are Trump and Giuliani going there? My theory is that the president knows this sort of language drives the media crazy, guaranteeing denunciations and debates. This creates partisan warfare that almost drowns out the underlying issues—is he guilty of anything?—and makes many people tune out the high-decibel rhetoric.\nTrump has the constitutional right to do that. Whether it will work politically is another question.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of "MediaBuzz" (Sundays 11 a.m.).

But the large field of Democratic candidates in several of these races threatens to split the vote, in turn allowing at least one Republican to advance to the general election.\xa0\nThe Democratic Party establishment has tried for months to winnow its candidate field to avoid that scenario -- particularly in races for four seats representing Orange County where Hillary Clinton in 2016 became the first Democratic presidential nominee since the mid-1930s to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, more than $8 million in so-called “outside money” has reportedly been spent on three of the races, much of it by Democratic groups, targeting seats held by GOP Reps. Darrell Issa, Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce.\xa0\n\n\n\nDemocrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, will need to win 23 House seats this year to take control of the chamber, and California is key to that plan.\xa0\nBut early Democratic efforts to reduce their California rosters -- including purported promises of future support to low-tier candidates -- have yielded only limited success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race to unseat Rohrabacher still has 13 candidates, including five Democrats, with voters going to the polls in just six days. Rohrabacher has won his race more than a dozen consecutive times, and the glut of Democratic candidates could work to his advantage.\xa0\nFurther, the name of at least one of the dropout candidates, Laura Oatman, will reportedly remain on Tuesday’s ballot. And the rise of Republican candidate Scott Baugh, a former state legislator, could give the GOP a one-two finish next week.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, whose mission is to get party candidates elected and re-elected to the House, in recent days has gotten fully behind businessman Harley Rouda in the Rohrabacher race. The group promoted Rouda to its “top-tier” Red to Blue program. But whether the step is enough to rally voters behind Rouda remains unclear.\nWashington Democrats, who have sent teams of staffers to work at an Irvine field office and to help with get-out-the-vote efforts, find themselves in a similar situation with the House seats held by Issa and Royce, who are retiring.\n“Moving out West is one of the improvements that we’re making at the DCCC in order to maximize gains in the midterms,” New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Luján, chairman of the DCCC, said near the start of the midterm cycle.\nOn Wednesday, the group acknowledged that its excess of qualified and well-funded candidates poses a “serious risk” of Democrats being “shut out” in multiple races. However, the DCCC also said its 18-month investment in California has expanded Democrats’ battlefield to 10 of the 14 GOP-held House seats.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrat Andy Thorburn is vying for GOP Rep. Ed Royce\'s open California seat. But a crowded field and damaging attacks by Democratic rival Gil Cisneros are hurting the party\'s chances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n“The DCCC is proud to have invested in and opened up new territory for California Democrats ahead of next week’s primary,” group spokeswoman Meredith Kelly said. “California Democrats have organized, marched and fought like hell to hold California Republicans accountable.”\nDemocrats were excited this winter when Royce, amid a changing district electorate and an energized Democratic base, decided to leave the House after 13 terms. But their chances of winning his open seat also have been dimmed by too many candidates seeking what they considered a golden opportunity to get elected to Congress.\nThe race still has 17 candidates including six Democrats. Sources told Fox News that the DCCC tried unsuccessfully to get at least one of the candidates, former Obama administration staffer Sam Jammal, to quit the race.\nThe top two candidates now appear to be Gil Cisneros and Andy Thorburn.\nCisneros is a $266 million lottery winner and Navy veteran who has also been named to the DCCC’s select group of candidates.\nThorburn is a former insurance executive who appears a favorite among liberals, with endorsements from nurses who want universal health care and Our Revolution, a Bernie Sanders-inspired political committee.\nHowever, the attacks that the campaigns have launched at each other became so damaging that the state party in recent days intervened to broker a truce.\nThe region’s changing demographics, including immigrants moving in from Los Angeles, contributed to Issa deciding not to seek a 10th term. He survived by 1,600 votes in 2016.\nMore than a dozen candidates are on the ballot Tuesday to replace him, including Marine-turned-lawyer Doug Applegate, the Democrat who nearly won in 2016.\nMeanwhile, some Republicans believe the threat of a Democratic upset is overrated for Rohrabacher and Rep. Mimi Walters, the fourth House Republican they\'ve targeted in Orange County.\nBoth won by double digits in 2016, even though Clinton carried their districts. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the Walters race as “likely Republican,” and puts none of the three other targeted races in Democrats’ or even tossup columns.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

News also broke Sunday night that the first lady will not join her husband at the G7 summit in Quebec later this week, and there are “no plans” for her to travel to Singapore to meet with North Korea’s leader later this month.\xa0\nThe liberal, anti-Trump corners of the Internet have seized on that news, and spread conspiracy theories ranging from a more serious health issue to speculation of\xa0domestic violence.\xa0\n\nI wish that I didn’t suspect that the prolonged, poorly explained public absence of Melania Trump could be about concealing abuse. I wish that it was a ludicrous prospect. I wish that the @POTUS wasn’t a man with a history of abusing women, including those to whom he is married.— Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) June 3, 2018\n\n\nRolling Stone senior writer Jamil Smith on Sunday wrote, “I wish that I didn’t suspect that the prolonged, poorly explained public absence of Melania Trump could be about concealing abuse. I wish that it was a ludicrous prospect.”\n\n\n\nABC News’ “The View”\xa0spent a segment\xa0on Monday speculating that her kidney procedure was worse than reported before co-host Whoopi Goldberg declared, “She’s fine. Sometimes people just don’t want to be out in the public.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN also has focused in recent days on questions about the first lady’s whereabouts.\nThe liberal network’s “Reliable Sources” newsletter led with a giant graphic of a calendar, placing question marks on each date since Mrs. Trump was “last seen” on May 10. Beneath the graphic, the newsletter specifically stated that she is expected to attend an event on Monday to honor Gold Star families.\n“BUT BUT: The event is closed to the press, so Monday evening may not resolve the mystery,” CNN’s Brian Stelter wrote. He made a similar argument on Twitter, writing “if the event is closed press, it means the ‘Melania hasn’t been seen in public’ issue will linger.”\nThe first lady took to Twitter last week herself to dispel rumors circulating about her whereabouts.\n“I see the media is working overtime speculating where I am & what I’m doing,” Mrs. Trump\xa0tweeted. “Rest assured, I’m here at the\xa0@WhiteHouse\xa0w my family, feeling great, & working hard on behalf of children & the American people!”\nFox News’ John Roberts and Brian Flood contributed to this report.\n\nAlex Pappas is a politics reporter at FoxNews.com.

On \'America\'s Newsroom,\' Blackburn says she is excited about the momentum in her state.\n\n\n\n\nAs President Trump travels to Tennessee, his presence is expected to give a boost to Senate hopeful Marsha Blackburn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican congressman is vying for her party’s nomination to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican. Blackburn and former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen have emerged as their parties’ leaders and are expected to face off in a general election that is considered a toss-up by Fox News.\nBredesen is leading Blackburn by 5 points, according to Real Clear Politics’ polling average.\n\nTrump is traveling to Nashville, Tennessee on Tuesday to raise campaign cash for Blackburn, the GOP’s leading U.S. Senate hopeful in Tennessee, and headline a rally with his most loyal supporters. The Tennessee campaign is among several races crucial to Trump’s plans to maintain control of the Senate, where Republicans are defending a narrow two-seat majority.\nTrump won Tennessee with more than 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 presidential election.\nPrimaries are scheduled for Aug. 2.\n\n\n\nRead on for a look at the top candidates.\nMarsha Blackburn\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn has served in Congress since 2003.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Reuters/Mike Segar)\n\n\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn, 65, has served in Congress since 2003.\nBlackburn was the first woman in the state to win a congressional seat without following a husband in the post, her U.S. House biography states. She serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nTrump has already endorsed Blackburn, calling her a “wonderful woman who has always been there when we needed her.” He praised her work on military issues and border security.\n\n.@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2018\n\n\nBlackburn served on Trump’s transition team and has not shied away from embracing the president. She is one of the lawmakers who signed onto a letter nominating the president for the Nobel Peace Prize. She’s called herself a “hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.”\n“Things are shaping up so well” for her Senate campaign, Blackburn told Fox News, adding that she’s excited about the “momentum.” She said she’s confident that a “great red wall” in Tennessee will prevent a “blue wave” of Democrats taking over her state in the midterm elections.\nAside from Trump, Blackburn has also gotten an assist from the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a nonprofit advocacy group. AFP thanked Blackburn in a full-page ad in The Tennessean over Memorial Day weekend for voting against a $1.3 trillion spending bill earlier this year.\nIf elected, Blackburn said on her campaign website\xa0she would focus on anti-abortion and pro-gun rights issues. Additionally, her focus would be on veterans and supporting Trump’s “immigration ban.”\nPrior to her tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives, Blackburn served as a state senator and chair of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment and Music Commission, according to Memphis Magazine.\nShe is a graduate of Mississippi State University. \xa0\nPhil Bredesen\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Bredesen is a former Democratic governor of Tennessee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(AP)\n\n\n\nFormer Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen is vying to become the first Democrat to win a Senate campaign in The Volunteer State since Al Gore in 1990.\nBredesen, 74, is not hyper-partisan and has promised in campaign ads that he is not “running against” the president.\n“I’ve been upset with what’s going on in Washington, D.C. It’s been going on for a while; it’s not just Trump or anything like that,” Bredesen told the Johnson City Press. “Most particularly, it just seems [Washington, D.C.] has got to a place where nothing gets done, everyone stands around and yells at the other person.”\nBredesen was first elected governor in 2002, having served as Nashville’s mayor before that. He led Tennessee until 2011. When he won re-election in 2006, Bredesen became the first governor to win all 95 counties in Tennessee, according to his campaign website, which also touts his penchant for working across the aisle on legislative issues. Additionally, Bredesen created a health care management company.\nOutgoing Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican, gave a boost to Bredesen in the race as he said the former governor is sure to appeal to at least some GOP voters.\n"He was a very good mayor, a very good governor, a very good business person,” Corker told reporters in April. “Look, I’m not going to campaign against someone who I’ve been friends with and worked with.”\nBredesen has said he does “well” with those he called “economic Republicans, the more traditional-minded Republicans,” given his business background.\n“Bob Corker is a perfect example of what I’d call an economic Republican,” he told the Johnson City Press. “He’s sensible, out of the business world and is focused on getting things done. I think there are a lot of people who have voted for him, who still would and who I believe I can attract.”\nIf elected, Bredesen, who graduated from Harvard University with a physics degree, would be one of the richest members in Congress, The Tennessean reported. Recent financial disclosures showed he has between $88.9 million and $358 million in total investment assets from January 2017 to February 2018.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nKaitlyn Schallhorn is a Reporter for Fox News.

Nixon is running to be governor of the state.\nThe messages were “sent in error,” Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Nixon\'s campaign, told the Post.\xa0\n\n“Something like this obviously would have been caught through our normal review process,” she explained. “The proper steps have been taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”\nThe AP pointed out that Lis Smith, a campaign aide for incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo, took to Twitter. She referenced Nixon’s role as lawyer Miranda Hobbes on “Sex and the City” in a Friday tweet.\xa0\n\nI know the character @cynthianixon played on TV never left the island of Manhattan, but you\'d think someone trying to play the role of NY gubernatorial candidate could hire better writers than this #Ithica https://t.co/9GL94o1P4k— Lis Smith (@Lis_Smith) June 1, 2018\n\n\nBERNIE SANDERS TAKES JOB-KILLING STANDS AT DISNEY WORKERS\' RALLY, CRITICS SAY\n\n\n\n“I know the character @cynthianixon played on TV never left the island of Manhattan, but you\'d think someone trying to play the role of NY gubernatorial candidate could hire better writers than this #Ithica,” she said.\xa0\nCuomo and Nixon are slated to go up against one another in a Democratic primary, the Democrat & Chronicle reports.\n“We all make typos,” Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick, a Cuomo supporter, told the paper.\nMyrick said he believes the typo “exposes the two things that I most worry about with her candidacy: their campaign’s lack of knowledge with issues outside of New York City and their inexperience.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending in Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats nominate Rep.

The Daily Calller first reported on the error.\nFormer Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted one of the pictures showing kids in one of the enclosures, criticized the government for neglecting the children.\n\n“This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible,” Favreau reportedly said before deleting the tweet.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted one of the pictures showing kids in enclosed cages, noting that “this is happening right now” and criticized the government for neglecting the children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\xa0(Twitter)\n\n\n\nThe pictures follow a controversy over the Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy of separating parents and children when they cross the border illegally.\n“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”\n\n\n\nTrump fired back on Saturday, suggesting the “horrible law” isn’t new and urged Democrats to support its repeal. “Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” he tweeted.\n\nPut pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!

At the time of writing, the tweet has still not been deleted.\n“I saw this photo floating around and didn’t know if it was real. It is,” King wrote. “Children of immigrants are being held in cages, like dogs, at ICE detention centers, sleeping on the floor. It’s an abomination.”\n\nI saw this photo floating around and didn’t know if it was real. It is.

Still disturbing, of course, but only indirectly related to current situation. My bad (and a good reminder not to RT things while distracted w family on the weekend),” he wrote.\nFox News’ Adam Shaw contributed to this report. \n\nLukas Mikelionis is a reporter for FoxNews.com.
