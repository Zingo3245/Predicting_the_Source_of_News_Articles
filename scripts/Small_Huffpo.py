Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who demanded that DeVos give a yes or no answer to whether the law allows this. DeVos first told Murphy that the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe “says students that are not documented have the right to an education.” When pressed for clarification, DeVos said she thinks “a school is a sacrosanct place for students to be able to learn, and they should be protected there.”\nMurphy accused DeVos of ducking the question. “I think educators know in their hearts that they need to ensure that students have a safe place to learn,” DeVos responded.\nFinally, after multiple rounds of prodding and Murphy’s question,\xa0“So they can’t call ICE?” DeVos responded:\xa0“I don’t think they can.”\xa0\nExchange between Sen. @ChrisMurphyCT & Secretary Betsy DeVos on whether teachers should refer undocumented students to @ICEgov.Sen.

A week ago, in an exchange with Rep.\xa0Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) while testifying before the House Education and the Workforce Committee, DeVos said she thinks it’s “a school decision, it’s a local community decision” whether school leaders should call ICE on undocumented students or families.\nThe Education Department subsequently said DeVos believes that schools should follow the principles established by Plyler v. Doe, which requires public schools to educate all students. Many critics of the education secretary, however, demanded a more public correction.\xa0By Monday,\xa0over 100 members of Congress had signed a letter reiterating the need for a “swift, decisive, and widely disseminated correction.”\nEspaillat said Tuesday, after DeVos’ appearance before the Senate subcommitee, that he doesn’t believe her new statement goes far enough.\n″I would like to see from her a more definitive answer, as opposed to ‘I think,’” Espaillat told HuffPost. “I think is in the right direction, but it’s not a definitive answer.”\nEspaillat said he is “perplexed” that DeVos hasn’t clarified the issue.\n“This only lends itself to people feeling afraid or skeptical about things and it doesn’t help matters,” said Espaillat. ”We would like to have a definitive answer, and it should be more along the lines of, this is what the law says, therefore they cannot do it.”\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

But Don Fox, who headed the federal Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama, told the Post\xa0that the call raised concerns about the “misuse of public office.”\nPruitt brushed off the report on Wednesday and signaled his and his wife’s enthusiasm for the fast-food chain.\n“I love, she loves, we love [Chick-fil-A],” he said. “Chick-fil-A is a franchise of faith, and it’s one of the best in the country.

  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with.

  'sub_title': 'Your favorites are coming back.',
  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on\xa0Netflix.\n\xa0\n“Sense8: The Series Finale”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Sense8" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A group of eight people across the world realize they’re telepathically linked. Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'sub_title': '"Civility is just nice words. Maybe we should all worry a little bit more about the niceness of our actions."',
  'body': '\nLate-night host Samantha Bee issued an on-air apology to Ivanka Trump on Wednesday evening, a week after she called the president’s daughter a “feckless c**t” during a segment on her program.\n“A lot of people were offended and angry that I used an epithet to describe the president’s daughter and adviser last week,” Bee said at the beginning of her show, “Full Frontal.” “It is a word I have used on the show many times hoping to reclaim it. This time I used it as an insult; I crossed the line and I regret it, and I do apologize for that.”\nThe apology echoed another that Bee made last week, a day after her comment caused a firestorm that led to advertisers dropping the program and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders labeling the host “vile and vicious.”\nBee elaborated that she’d attempted to normalize the use of the term with her humor but noted that “many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives.”\n“A lot of them don’t want that word reclaimed. They want it gone, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want to inflict more pain on them. I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest, and I never intended it to hurt anyone except Ted Cruz,” she quipped. “Many men were also offended by my use of the word. I do not care about that.”\nThe host ended her monologue with another apology, to children currently being held in juvenile detention centers under a new Trump administration policy that has seen an increase in families being separated after crossing the border illegally.\n“I hate that this distracted from more important issues. I hate that I did something to contribute to the nightmare of 24-hours news cycles that were all white-knuckling through,” Bee said. “I should’ve known that a potty-mouthed insult would’ve been inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy. I would do anything to help those kids, I hate that this distracted from them,\xa0so to them, I am also sorry.”\n“But you know what? Civility is just nice words.

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},
 {'title': "Republicans Look Ready To Force A Vote On Democrats' DACA Proposal",
  'sub_title': 'A petition could bring compromise measures to the House floor.',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― Unable to reach consensus on a GOP-only bill, Republican immigration proponents in the U.S. House of Representatives are getting close to forcing votes on legislation to protect immigrants brought to the United States when they were children.\nGOP leaders continue to express optimism that they can come up with a bill addressing President Donald Trump’s four pillars on immigration: border security, renewing the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program, eliminating the diversity visa lottery program, and curbing family-based immigration.\n“I feel good about the kind of conversations that we’re having,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Wednesday morning, adding that he thought there was a “sweet spot” for Republicans on immigration. \nBut throughout multiple meetings Wednesday that leaders described in vague terms like “productive,” the sweet spot seemed to elude lawmakers.\n“I don’t think there will be a deal today,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Wednesday. He said there were a number of issues Republicans still hadn’t reached consensus on, like a question of whether there would be a special pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients ― or something akin to citizenship, like permanent legal status ― and he didn’t see Republicans coalescing behind a bill before enough members signed onto a discharge petition that is currently just three members short of forcing a vote.\nWhen 218 lawmakers sign a discharge petition, they can force a vote on a bill ― or, in this case, a number of bills ― on the second or fourth Monday of a month.\nWhen Meadows was asked if there were some Republicans who just could never get behind a special pathway, even if the legislation included the border security measures like a wall that conservatives want, the Freedom Caucus chairman said that was a “thornier question.”\n“A special pathway is almost as bad as the ‘amnesty’ word, and so we’re looking at ways for citizenship that does not disadvantage people who have been in line for a long time,” Meadows said.\nBut for the GOP moderates who are on the verge of forcing a vote, that special pathway is a key component of any immigration bill ― and that makes a compromise difficult.\nThere are plenty of Republicans who are willing to compromise. Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Wednesday that even though he opposes a special pathway to legal permanent residence, he was open to discussion on the issue if the other priorities like a wall were satisfied.\n“But if you’re coming to me with a special pathway, you gotta have these other categories before I’m willing to negotiate,” Walker said.\n\n\n\n\nReuters\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address in January. He used the speech to lay out the "four pillars" of any immigration deal he\'d be willing to sign.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for Republicans, there are a critical number of GOP lawmakers who aren’t willing to negotiate on that topic. For the moderates who want to address immigration, a pathway has to be part of the discussion. If it’s not, they might as well force a vote with Democrats through the discharge petition, score the political points associated with posturing on the issue, and wait for the dynamics of Congress to change ― perhaps for Democrats to take the majority ― before lawmakers actually find a solution.\nAnd for the immigration hard-liners, like Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), there’s no compromise to be had.\nKing told reporters Wednesday that he wanted to avoid all votes on any immigration bill. \n“A majority of the Republicans here have never voted for amnesty,” King said, using an immigration term favored by hard-liners. “You put a compromise bill up on the floor, and all but 10 or 12 Republicans vote for amnesty? They’re forever marked by that and they can never get their virtue back.”\nFor those immigration opponents, it’s better to have a couple dozen Republicans side with Democrats than have 218 Republicans find consensus on an immigration measure, even if it is more GOP-friendly. Hard-liners don’t see the Senate taking up any immigration legislation that is the result of a discharge petition, and they don’t think Trump would sign such a bill.\nBut while those far-right lawmakers look to blow up a compromise, there are some Republicans who believe they could potentially come up with a bill that would win broad support from Republicans and Democrats ― or at least the support of enough Democrats to get it through the House.\nRep. John Faso (R-N.Y.), who has signed the discharge petition, told HuffPost Wednesday that he believes any bill on immigration will have to be bipartisan.\n“Some Republicans won’t vote for anything because some of the talking heads on the right will call it amnesty, and some Democrats won’t vote for anything because they want no border security at all,” Faso said.\nDemocrats have so far shown a willingness to give Republicans border security money, even a border wall, if it means a permanent solution for DACA recipients. But Faso’s own sweet spot, he said, would likely be an immigration bill that meets Trump’s four pillars and wins the support of 60-80 Democrats.\nThat level of support seems unrealistic, given the hold that House Democratic leaders seem to have on their caucus. Perhaps a few, maybe even a dozen, Democrats would defect on an immigration proposal, but Democrats largely seem intent on voting as a bloc.\nWith that in mind, the most likely scenario is still one where almost all Democrats join about 25 or 26 Republicans in signing the discharge petition and forcing a vote.\xa0GOP leaders have so far been able to keep enough Republicans off the petition, partly with the promise that they’re working on a solution and that lawmakers should wait for this special conference meeting on Thursday where Republicans will discuss the topic. But time may finally be up.\nRep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), one of Trump’s staunchest supporters in Congress, has also signed the discharge petition. He told HuffPost on Wednesday that there was “a plethora” of Republicans ready to sign the petition if leaders couldn’t find consensus on a bill by Thursday.\n“We got the names,” he said.\nArthur Delaney contributed reporting.\n\n\n\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images\n\n\nHouse Speaker\xa0Paul Ryan\xa0(R-Wis.), pictured in May, said Wednesday,\xa0“I feel good about the kind of conversations that we’re having.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

And so that’s something we were very excited about ... We need more of them across the country.”\n“It’s an exciting time,” he added.\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to requests for clarification whether a business deal between Marlyn Pruitt and Chick-fil-A was still a possibility.\nTuesday’s revelation is the latest in a string of controversies involving Scott Pruitt in recent weeks.

  'sub_title': 'Your favorites are coming back.',
  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on\xa0Netflix.\n\xa0\n“Sense8: The Series Finale”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Sense8" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A group of eight people across the world realize they’re telepathically linked. Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

His sites were terminated by their domain host on Tuesday.\nOn the phone, he was open about his pedophilia\xa0and\xa0seemingly unfazed about his long odds of attaining government office.\n“A lot of people are tired of political correctness and being constrained by it,” he said.\xa0“People prefer when there’s an outsider who doesn’t have anything to lose and is willing to say what’s on a lot of people’s minds.”\nWhen asked whether he’s a pedophile or just writes about pedophilia, he said, “It’s a mix of both. When people go over the top there’s a grain of truth to what they say.”\nAsked whether there was a “grain of truth” in his essay about father-daughter incest and another about raping his ex-wife repeatedly, he said yes, offering that plenty of women have rape fantasies.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nNathanLarsonorg\n\n\nNathan Larson is running for Congress as an independent in Virginia. In an interview with HuffPost, he was open about his pedophilia.\n\n\n\nAccording to Larson’s campaign manifesto, his platform as a “quasi-neoreactionary libertarian” candidate includes protecting gun ownership rights, establishing free trade and protecting “benevolent white supremacy,” as well as legalizing incestuous marriage and child pornography.\nIn the manifesto, Larson called Nazi leader Adolf Hitler a “white supremacist hero.” He urged Congress to repeal the Violence Against Women Act, adding, “We need to switch to a system that classifies women as property, initially of their fathers and later of their husbands.” He also showed sympathy for men who identify as involuntary celibates, or incels, suggesting it is unfair that they “are forced to pay taxes for schools, welfare, and other support for other men’s children.”\nUsing the pseudonyms Leucosticte and Lysander, Larson frequently participated in conversations on his own message boards, he confirmed to HuffPost.\n\n\n\n\nsuiped org\n\n\nLarson posted as "Lysander" on his now-defunct website, suiped.org.\n\n\n\nAs Lysander on suiped.org, a forum for “suicidal pedophiles,” Larson wrote numerous posts endorsing child rape and other forms of sexual abuse.\n“Why doesn’t every pedo just focus on making money so they can get a pedo-wife and then either impregnate her with some fucktoys or adopt some fucktoys?” he wrote on the platform in October. “That would accommodate both those who are and aren’t into incest. And of course, the adoption process lets you pick a boy or a girl.” \nLarson has a 3-year-old daughter who lives with relatives. He told HuffPost that he relinquished his parental rights during a custody battle. His ex-wife got a court-ordered restraining order against him in 2015 before she died by suicide. He has since remarried, he says, and is now living in Catlett, Virginia.\nLarson used the moniker “Leucosticte” on incelocalypse.today ― a forum for incels who are pedophiles that was removed this week after the website Babe contacted the domain host. There, he\xa0identified as a “hebephilic rapist,” noting that he’s not a typical incel because he’d had sex by raping his ex-wife. \nAccording to the site, which HuffPost viewed before it was taken down, “incelocalypse” refers to “the day we make the jailbaits our rape-slaves.” (The term “jailbait” is slang for a person who is under the legal age of consent for sex.)\n\n\n\n\nincelocalypse today\n\n\nLarson posted as "Leucosticte" on incelocalypse.today.\n\n\n\nHuffPost did not view any posts explicitly stating that he has engaged in sexual activity with minors, although he repeatedly expressed a desire to have sex with infants and children, including his own daughter. In the phone call, Larson said that the word “pedophile” is “vague” and “just a label,” adding that it’s “normal” for men to be attracted to underage women. He said he did not commit any crimes.\nIn a 3,300-word essay on incelocalypse.today, titled “Here’s How to Psyche Yourself Up to Feel Entitled to Rape,” Larson tells other members: “Don’t forget: feminism is the problem, and rape is the solution.” On the platform, he also advocated for father-daughter marriage, killing women and raping virgins.\nLarson is less worried about his run for Congress than about his sites coming down. He told HuffPost that the termination of his websites is an affront to his freedom of speech and that he’s going to try to get them hosted elsewhere. Not that it’ll matter ― there are still plenty of forums where incels and other such communities can congregate. The removal of Larson’s sites caused an uproar on incels.me, a separate, much larger forum for incels.\nLarson’s political ambitions span more than a decade. He first ran for Congress in Virginia’s 1st District in 2008 on what he described as an “anarcho-capitalist” platform. That same year, he sent a letter to the Secret Service threatening to kill the president, which landed him in federal prison for 14 months and barred him from seeking public office\xa0in Virginia (convicted felons are free to run for federal office).\nBut in 2016, then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) restored voting and other civil rights to thousands of felons, allowing Larson to run for state office. In 2017 he ran in Virginia’s House of Delegates District 31 and secured less than 2 percent of the vote. Now he is gunning for a seat in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District.\n\n\n\n\nNathan Larson\n\n\nOn websites, Nathan Larson, 37, has advocated for rape, pedophilia, incest and kidnapping.\n\n\n\nUntil it was pulled down, Larson’s site Nathania.org, a wiki page with details about his latest candidacy, featured posts titled “A Man Should Be Allowed to Choke His Wife to Death as Punishment for Cutting Her Hair Short Without Permission, or Other Acts of Gross Insubordination,” “Advantages of Father-Daughter Incest” and “The Justifiability of an Incel’s Kidnapping a Girl and Keeping Her as His Rape-Slave for Sex and Babymaking.” Wiki pages can be edited by other people, but Larson confirmed he wrote these posts as well as several other disturbing entries.\nIn “Let’s Define What Rape Is,” a 3,000-word essay posted on Nathania.org as well as other incel sites, Larson wrote: “Women are objects, to be taken care of by men like any other property, and for powerful men to insert themselves into as it pleases them, and as they believe will be in women’s own interests. In most cases, their interests are aligned, as long as the man is strong. Female sex-slaves actually get a much better deal than animals, because in most cases, they are allowed to reproduce, unlike animals raised for meat or companionship.”\nWhen asked what his constituents would think about his pedophiliac writings, he said, “People are open-minded.”\nHe continued, “A lot of people who disagreed with someone like Trump … might vote for them anyway just because the establishment doesn’t like them.”\nClarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that, until 2016, Larson was barred only from running for state office. He was always eligible to run for federal office.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the\xa0National\xa0Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

This time I used it as an insult; I crossed the line and I regret it, and I do apologize for that.”\nThe apology echoed another that Bee made last week, a day after her comment caused a firestorm that led to advertisers dropping the program and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders labeling the host “vile and vicious.”\nBee elaborated that she’d attempted to normalize the use of the term with her humor but noted that “many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives.”\n“A lot of them don’t want that word reclaimed. They want it gone, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want to inflict more pain on them.

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

 {'title': 'Kate Spade Suffered From Mental Illness For Years, Her Family Says',
  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

And so that’s something we were very excited about ... We need more of them across the country.”\n“It’s an exciting time,” he added.\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to requests for clarification whether a business deal between Marlyn Pruitt and Chick-fil-A was still a possibility.\nTuesday’s revelation is the latest in a string of controversies involving Scott Pruitt in recent weeks.

  'sub_title': 'Your favorites are coming back.',
  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on\xa0Netflix.\n\xa0\n“Sense8: The Series Finale”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Sense8" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A group of eight people across the world realize they’re telepathically linked. Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

This time I used it as an insult; I crossed the line and I regret it, and I do apologize for that.”\nThe apology echoed another that Bee made last week, a day after her comment caused a firestorm that led to advertisers dropping the program and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders labeling the host “vile and vicious.”\nBee elaborated that she’d attempted to normalize the use of the term with her humor but noted that “many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives.”\n“A lot of them don’t want that word reclaimed. They want it gone, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want to inflict more pain on them. I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest, and I never intended it to hurt anyone except Ted Cruz,” she quipped. “Many men were also offended by my use of the word. I do not care about that.”\nThe host ended her monologue with another apology, to children currently being held in juvenile detention centers under a new Trump administration policy that has seen an increase in families being separated after crossing the border illegally.\n“I hate that this distracted from more important issues. I hate that I did something to contribute to the nightmare of 24-hours news cycles that were all white-knuckling through,” Bee said. “I should’ve known that a potty-mouthed insult would’ve been inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy. I would do anything to help those kids, I hate that this distracted from them,\xa0so to them, I am also sorry.”\n“But you know what? Civility is just nice words.

  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J.

The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004.

(The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Kate Spade Suffered From Mental Illness For Years, Her Family Says',
  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

This time I used it as an insult; I crossed the line and I regret it, and I do apologize for that.”\nThe apology echoed another that Bee made last week, a day after her comment caused a firestorm that led to advertisers dropping the program and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders labeling the host “vile and vicious.”\nBee elaborated that she’d attempted to normalize the use of the term with her humor but noted that “many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives.”\n“A lot of them don’t want that word reclaimed. They want it gone, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want to inflict more pain on them.

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

 {'title': 'Kate Spade Suffered From Mental Illness For Years, Her Family Says',
  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

And so that’s something we were very excited about ... We need more of them across the country.”\n“It’s an exciting time,” he added.\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to requests for clarification whether a business deal between Marlyn Pruitt and Chick-fil-A was still a possibility.\nTuesday’s revelation is the latest in a string of controversies involving Scott Pruitt in recent weeks.

  'sub_title': 'Your favorites are coming back.',
  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on\xa0Netflix.\n\xa0\n“Sense8: The Series Finale”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Sense8" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A group of eight people across the world realize they’re telepathically linked. Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'body': "\nPresident Donald Trump uses a cellphone not equipped with top security features and has rejected repeated attempts by his staff to harden his devices against hackers, Politico reported on Monday.\nTrump regularly uses at least two government-issued iPhones — one a “burner” device capable only of making calls, and another that’s loaded with a Twitter app and “a handful of news sites,” according to Politico, which said former government security experts criticized the president’s phone practices.\nTrump’s call-only phone has a camera and microphone — features that can be exploited by hackers, Politico reported, citing two senior administration officials as sources. As for the phone Trump uses for Twitter, the president reportedly has rebuffed his staff’s advice to swap the device every month, saying it would be “too inconvenient.”\xa0\nTrump’s attitude toward his own communications security contrasts with Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state ― something Trump and his allies have\xa0assailed for years. \xa0\nPolitico said Trump has gone for as long as five months without getting his Twitter phone checked by security experts. The GPS trackers on both of Trump’s devices have reportedly been deactivated.\xa0\nBarack Obama's transition team gave him a bare bones phone that he joked was essentially useless.

A senior West Wing official told the outlet that the call-only phones “are seamlessly swapped out on a regular basis through routine support operations.

Security experts expressed concern that the president was exposing himself to security risks, including hacking and eavesdropping by foreign governments.\xa0\n“Use of personal smartphones, which may not have all of the security features of government-issued smartphones or be regularly updated to address newly discovered vulnerabilities, present an obvious potential security risk,”\xa0Mary McCord,\xa0a former head of the Justice Department’s national security division, told CNN.\xa0\nSimilar warnings were repeated this week.\n“Foreign adversaries seeking intelligence about the U.S. are relentless in their pursuit of vulnerabilities in our government’s communications networks, and there is no more sought-after intelligence target than the president of the United States,” Nate Jones, a former director of counterterrorism on the National Security Council during the Obama era, told Politico.\xa0\nIgnoring phone security for the sake of convenience,\xa0“could pose significant risks to the country,” Jones added.\nThe White House announced in January that staff and guests would be banned from using personal cellphones in the West Wing for security reasons.\xa0Press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to say whether the restriction would apply to Trump’s personal devices, reported NBC News.\nPeople on social media expressed alarm at the reported security shortcomings of the president’s phone use. Some were also quick to point out Trump’s repeated criticism of Clinton’s use of a private email server.\n“Will\xa0[Trump’s] supporters cheer ‘lock him up’?

  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with.

  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

This time I used it as an insult; I crossed the line and I regret it, and I do apologize for that.”\nThe apology echoed another that Bee made last week, a day after her comment caused a firestorm that led to advertisers dropping the program and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders labeling the host “vile and vicious.”\nBee elaborated that she’d attempted to normalize the use of the term with her humor but noted that “many women have heard that word at the worst moments of their lives.”\n“A lot of them don’t want that word reclaimed. They want it gone, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want to inflict more pain on them.

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

  'sub_title': 'Your favorites are coming back.',
  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on\xa0Netflix.\n\xa0\n“Sense8: The Series Finale”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Sense8" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A group of eight people across the world realize they’re telepathically linked. Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better.

And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

  'body': "\nLegendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov delivered a one-two punch Monday against Russian President Vladimir Putin — and Donald Trump — as he warned of the very serious threat to American democracy that the Kremlin “dictator” continues to pose to America.\n“Trump has more Russian connections than Aeroflot,” Kasparov said, referring to the Russian airline in a speech Monday at the Common Good Forum in New York. “I believe in coincidences, but I also believe in the KGB.”\nThe Russian dissident and human rights activist also accused Trump on MSNBC Monday of “trying to divert” the investigation of Russian interference into the U.S. presidential election to “minor details.” Trump’s “attempts to move away from the core of this investigation into some foolish stories just demonstrates that he is quite desperate, and that he wants to control this process by tweeting and by shouting,” Kasparov added.\nTrump’s new fury has been directed at his latest claim that the FBI planted a mole in his campaign, and he ordered the Justice Department to investigate. Last year, he claimed that the Obama administration had ordered the FBI to wiretap meetings in Trump Tower. There is no evidence that happened.\nTrump is more outraged about the FBI investigating Russian interference in his campaign & the election than he is about the interference.

America’s experience now with incendiary fake news campaigns is “nothing new for us in Russia,” he said, according to Yahoo News.\nHe underscored his belief that Putin is “a dictator,” and Russia’s leaders and oligarchs are corrupt.\n“Every country has its own mafia,” he said. “In Russia, the mafia has its own country.”\nHe said Americans can only defend themselves against a Kremlin onslaught if they fight for values they believe in, like truth and democracy.\n“You can’t defend yourself against Putin and the Putins of this world if you don’t believe what they are attacking is worth defending,” he warned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

 {'title': 'Kate Spade Suffered From Mental Illness For Years, Her Family Says',
  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'sub_title': 'The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, about three times more than the coal industry.',
  'body': "\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump's Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump's Wall, Let's Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

And so that’s something we were very excited about ... We need more of them across the country.”\n“It’s an exciting time,” he added.\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to requests for clarification whether a business deal between Marlyn Pruitt and Chick-fil-A was still a possibility.\nTuesday’s revelation is the latest in a string of controversies involving Scott Pruitt in recent weeks.

  'sub_title': 'Designer\'s husband said he and his daughter are "deeply heartbroken."',
  'body': '\nA day after the apparent suicide of fashion designer Kate Spade, her family spoke publicly about her death – acknowledging that she faced mental health issues – even as they tried to cope with their grief.\n“My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her,”\xa0Spade’s husband, Andy, said in a statement that was published by\xa0The New York Times. “We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.”\nKate Spade, who grew up in Kansas City, was found dead on Tuesday in her Park Avenue apartment in New York. She was 55. Authorities said her death was an apparent suicide by hanging and that neither her husband nor her daughter was home at the time.\nCalling his wife “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Andy Spade acknowledged that the couple had been living apart for the last 10 months.\n“We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce,” he said. “We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how.”\nAndy Spade also indicated that Kate had suffered from mental illness.\n“She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last five years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety,” he said.\xa0\nThe designer’s older sister, Reta Saffo of Santa Fe, New Mexico, said in an email to the Kansas City Star\xa0that Kate’s apparent suicide “was not unexpected by me.” Saffo said her sister had been deeply affected by the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who hanged himself in 2014.\xa0\n“We were freaked out/saddened,” Saffo said of Williams’ death, “but she kept watching it and watching it over and over. I think the plan was already in motion even as far back as then.”\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Toth via Getty Images\n\n\nKate Spade attending the AOL Build Series in April 2017.\n\n\n\nSaffo also said she had tried to persuade her sister to get in-patient treatment for mental health issues.\xa0\n“After numerous attempts, I finally let go,” Saffo wrote to the Star. “Sometimes you simply cannot SAVE people from themselves! One of the last things she said to me was, ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you PLEASE come to MINE, at least. Please!’ I know she perhaps had a plan, but she insisted she did not.”\nOther family members disputed Saffo’s account.\n“Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years,” Andy Spade said in his statement. “She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock.”\nThe designer’s 90-year-old father,\xa0Frank Brosnahan, who lives in Kansas City, told the Star that he had been aware of his daughter’s problems but that her death still came as a shock.\n“The last I talked with her, the night before last, she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges. She doted on her daughter,” Brosnahan said.\nHe also said he thought his daughter would be gratified if she knew that her death had shed light on mental illness.\n“One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that,” Brosnahan said. “She was always giving and charitable. If that helped anybody avoid anything — fine, she’d be delighted.”\xa0\xa0\nDavid Spade, the brother of Kate’s husband, said on Instagram, “I still can’t believe it. It’s a rough world out there people, try to hang on.”\xa0\nActress Rachel Brosnahan, Kate’s niece and the star of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,”\xa0also posted a tribute on Instagram:\xa0\n    Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered. She had a light that words can’t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent. Hug your loved ones extra tight today.

 {'title': 'ACLU Suit Over Family Separations At Border Allowed To Advance',
  'sub_title': 'The federal judge dealt a blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit.',
  'body': '\nA federal judge struck a blow Wednesday against the Trump administration\xa0and handed a victory to civil rights advocates who are fighting to end separations of migrant parents and children at the U.S. border.\nU.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San Diego denied the Trump administration’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, which seeks to halt the government’s policy of separating families. \nIn the ruling, which allowed the suit to move forward, the judge wrote that the practice described in the suit “arbitrarily tears at the sacred bond between parent and child.” \n“Such conduct, if true... is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency,” he wrote. “The facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue ‘shocks the conscience’ and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity.” \nThe ACLU filed the suit in February on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed into the U.S. with her 7-year-old daughter to seek asylum only to then be separated and detained over 1,000 miles apart, according to the group. The ACLU’s suit is seeking a nationwide injunction to stop the government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process.\nThe Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents and children at the border has sparked nationwide outrage in recent weeks and brought condemnation Tuesday from the United Nations human rights office.\nMr. President, the only “horrible law” is YOUR policy. YOU have the power to change it. If you saw what I saw today, you would. Never before has America deliberately inflicted cruelty on children to deter asylum seekers from finding refuge here. Never. And we never should. https://t.co/WRTUyNOesr— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) June 4, 2018\n\n\nAs early as December, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering a policy of separating migrant parents from children in detention centers. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the new policy, through which the administration would increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who crossed the border illegally ― even if that meant splitting children from parents, regardless of whether they were seeking safety in the U.S.\nPreviously, families that crossed illegally together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But under the new policy, all people who cross illegally are referred for prosecution ― meaning parents get sent to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service and children are placed in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for finding unaccompanied minors a sponsor to live with but now is taking charge of these children too. Some parents who have been separated from their kids through this process have then been unable to locate their children. \n“In the most forceful language, the court rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Constitution permits it to engage in the inhumane practice of tearing little children away from their parents,” the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said of Wednesday’s ruling in a statement to the media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},

They want it gone, and I don’t blame them. I don’t want to inflict more pain on them. I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest, and I never intended it to hurt anyone except Ted Cruz,” she quipped. “Many men were also offended by my use of the word. I do not care about that.”\nThe host ended her monologue with another apology, to children currently being held in juvenile detention centers under a new Trump administration policy that has seen an increase in families being separated after crossing the border illegally.\n“I hate that this distracted from more important issues. I hate that I did something to contribute to the nightmare of 24-hours news cycles that were all white-knuckling through,” Bee said. “I should’ve known that a potty-mouthed insult would’ve been inherently more interesting to them than juvenile immigration policy. I would do anything to help those kids, I hate that this distracted from them,\xa0so to them, I am also sorry.”\n“But you know what? Civility is just nice words.

 {'title': 'The White House Is Getting Pounded On Its Lies Again, So It’s Blaming The Media Again',
  'sub_title': 'Asked about Trump’s repeated untruths, Kellyanne Conway replied, What about Benghazi?',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON\xa0—\xa0With both new and newly revealed falsehoods providing fresh evidence undercutting the credibility of President Donald Trump and his staff, one top aide has turned to familiar scapegoats: the news media.\n“You neither wanted nor expected him to be the president,” Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. “The president says plenty of things that are true and right and important to America ... He’s not serially untruthful.”\nForeign policy experts, foreign diplomats, communications experts and even other Republican press staffers have long warned that the willingness of those in Trump’s White House to say untrue things (and at times to do so knowing what they are saying is untrue — that is, to lie) will eventually come back to haunt the country.\n“I worry about the loss of credibility in the institution,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center. “There may be a situation that’s consequential where the public needs to do something, and the president says to take action, and the public says, ‘Yeah, right.’”\nOne GOP consultant who spoke on condition of anonymity said Trump’s falsehoods seem deliberate. “Trump understands that voters expect that all politicians lie. He’s made the calculation that he can talk himself out of any situation,” the consultant said.\nTrump typically says or writes several things each day that are provably false. In the past week,\xa0he has claimed that he has started building his wall on the border with Mexico, that the military hadn’t received a pay raise in 10 years before he took office and that his stewardship has created the “Best Economy & Jobs EVER” — all of which are not true.\nBut the falsehood that has refocused attention on his credibility took place nearly a year ago, as Trump flew back to Washington from Germany after attending the G-20 meeting. Aboard Air Force One, Trump crafted a statement for release by his son Donald Trump Jr., saying that a June 2016 meeting between members of his campaign and a Russian lawyer was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\nThat Trump Tower meeting has become a focus of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible cooperation by Donald Trump Sr.’s campaign and Russian intelligence agencies, which were working to help him win the presidency.\nA 20-page letter from his lawyers to Mueller’s office in January acknowledged that Trump “dictated” that statement — flatly contradicting previous statements from Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\nSanders this week refused to explain the discrepancy, instead referring questions to Trump’s outside lawyers, and eventually said she tries to be truthful. “I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information,” she said Tuesday. “I think you all know I’m an honest person.”\nTen months earlier, though,\xa0she not only denied that Trump had done anything more than “weigh in” on the writing of the statement “like any father would,” but she attacked the media for even asking the question.\n“You guys are focused on a meeting that Don Jr. had of no consequence, when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine,” Sanders said at a press briefing on Aug. 1, 2017. “The Democrat-linked firm Fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that’s been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news. And if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia, look no further than the Clintons.”\nAt a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, Conway took the same approach when asked why Trump continued his habit of falsehoods and whether anyone in the White House had advised him against it.\n“Has the president said something that even comes close to ‘It was a videotape that caused the loss of life for people in Benghazi?’” Conway said in an 850-word response that answered neither of the questions posed. “I mean, why was I the campaign manager for the winning part of the campaign and talking to people in McComb County, Michigan, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and not Moscow? Why have I never met George Papadopoulos or Carter Page?”\nThe Trump White House’s strained relationship with facts began on his first full day as president. During a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Trump claimed that his inauguration drew some 1.5 million people — when in reality, it had attracted only a fraction of that. Trump that evening sent his then–press secretary Sean Spicer into the White House briefing room to scold reporters. Spicer did that, falsely claimed that Trump’s inaugural had the largest audience ever and left without taking questions.\nConway, the following day, famously labeled Spicer’s falsehoods “alternative facts” and then launched into unrelated topics and ultimately attacked her NBC News interviewer. “You want to talk about things the media doesn’t want to cover. You totally missed Brexit and Theresa May,” Conway said. “You totally missed Trump’s campaign. You want to talk about provable facts? You’ve missed it all along. America doesn’t really ― I mean, look, you got 14 percent approval rating in the media that you’ve earned. You want to push back on us.”\nShort of a national emergency, how much the White House’s propensity for untruths matters is unclear.\n“The fact is that Trump’s supporters don’t believe what the press says about him. They believe the press distorts his positions and twists what he says,” said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, estimating that 35 to 38 percent of voters are hard-core Trump supporters. “Continuing attacks on his credibility simply harden his base.”\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that while 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they believe Trump is less honest than most previous presidents, 27 percent believe he is about as honest, and 26 percent believe he is more honest. Those numbers have been relatively stable over the past year.\n“When the economy is doing well, people feel it. When a politician lies, people move on,” the GOP consultant said. “If the economy goes down or if we’re attacked, then it will matter.”\nIn the meantime, Trump’s White House continued dealing with his untruths. Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow — asked about Trump’s false claim that the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is the “best ever” — said the rate was among the lowest but would not acknowledge that Trump was incorrect. “The facts stand on their own. I’m not going to quibble with you about such things,” he said.\nAnd Conway, at the Christian Science Monitor breakfast, dealt with Trump’s repeated false claim that the military had not had a pay raise in 10 years before he became president — by repeating it.\n“Its first pay raise in quite a while,” she said during a rundown of Trump’s various accomplishments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Maine Is About To Try Out A New Way Of Electing Politicians',
  'sub_title': 'For the first time, people across the state can rank the candidates they want to represent them in the general election.',
  'body': '\nMark Eves wants to be the next governor of Maine, but in May he did something unusual for a candidate actively seeking office: He told voters who his second choice would be. \nBetsy Sweet, the fellow Democrat Eaves said was his second choice, returned the favor and said Eaves would be her second choice. \nPoliticians in primary races often endorse their former opponents after they end their campaigns, but the comments from Eves and Sweet have a much deeper significance ahead of Maine’s June 12 primaries. For the first time, people across the state won’t just choose one person to go on and represent them in the general election, but will get to rank the candidates in their preferred order. \nMaine will be the first place to use the system, called ranked-choice voting, in statewide races this June (it’s already used in some\xa0local elections). The system kicks in for contests that have three or more candidates. Here’s how it works:\n\n\nVoters rank the candidates in their party’s primary in order of preference. \n\n\nIf no candidate gets an outright majority, the candidate who got the fewest first-place votes is eliminated. \n\n\nThe second-place votes of those who supported the eliminated candidate then get distributed to the remaining candidates. \n\n\nThe process continues until one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the first-place votes and is declared the winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Maine Democratic primary indicating how voters can rank their choices instead of choosing just one.\n\n\n\nSupporters of the new system say that giving voters more choices encourages politicians to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, reducing extremism and polarization. They also say it makes races more competitive and gives voters more of a voice because they can choose the candidate they want ― even if that candidate doesn’t have much support ― without worrying that their ballot will be wasted. \nDetractors say the system is confusing and potentially unconstitutional.\nThe system is particularly appealing in Maine, a state with a strong tradition of independent candidates who can affect the outcomes of races and lead to a winner receiving less than a majority of votes. Gov. Paul LePage (R) won in 2010 with just 38.2 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2014 with 48.2 percent. As of March, the number of voters unenrolled in a party in Maine outnumbered those in a political party. In nine of the state’s 11 gubernatorial races, the winner has gotten less than 50 percent of the vote.\nEves, a former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, says the new way of voting hasn’t changed much about the way he’s campaigning, but when he meets a voter whose mind is already made up in favor of someone else, he asks to be considered as a second choice. \n“What I like about is you’re still in the game,” Eves said in an interview. “You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical, so you still have any opportunity to persuade somebody to be [their] second-choice vote.”\n\nWhat I like about is you’re still in the game. You’re still earning people’s votes. It might not be their first vote, but those second votes are going to be extraordinarily critical.\nMaine gubernatorial candidate Mark Eves, a Democrat\n\nThe seven Democrats and four Republicans vying to be the nominees of their respective parties have still exchanged plenty of political attacks. But candidates have to be more calculating and weigh the effectiveness of a counterattack that would potentially lose them the second-place votes of an opponent’s supporters.\nMonica Castellanos, a spokeswoman for Adam Cote, another Democratic candidate for governor, said ranked-choice voting hadn’t really affected campaign strategy, because it’s unclear what impact it will have on the electorate.\n“I think we just don’t know. We have nothing to compare it to,” she said.\nNot everyone is a fan of ranked-choice voting.\nWhile Democrats have embraced the new system, Republicans have opposed it. They say it’s confusing, and point to a provision in the Maine Constitution that says candidates for office only have to be elected by a plurality, not a majority. \nMaine’s Supreme Judicial Court issued\xa0an advisory opinion in 2017 that, based on that constitutional provision, ranked-choice voting could not be used in general elections for state offices.\xa0Despite that opinion, the court issued a separate order this year\xa0instructing the state to use it in its primary elections.\n\n\n\n\nMaine Secretary of State\n\n\nA sample ballot for the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maine.\xa0\n\n\n\nRepublicans have fought hard to block the new system in court, saying Democrats are pushing the measure to ensure that a conservative governor can’t get elected to office. And even Democrats in other states have opposed a ranked-choice system. California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) blocked its wider use, saying ranked-choice voting is “overly complicated and confusing” and “deprives voters of genuinely informed choice.”\n“I think you outright win these things. With ranked choice, you could be No. 2 and win. I don’t think that makes sense in an office where any degree of strength is required,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. \nNone of the Republicans running for governor in Maine responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Garrett Mason, the state Senate’s majority leader and a Republican candidate for governor,\xa0told PBS in May that ranked-choice voting was illegal. \n“The word plurality is very specific in Maine’s constitution. It means first past the post, whoever has the most votes wins, and that was deliberate and on purpose. I took an oath to uphold the constitution and the constitution is clear on this matter. It’s illegal,” Mason said. \n“This was a way to make sure that Paul LePage never got elected again, or someone like Paul LePage never got elected again,” he added. “It’s mean-spirited, it is partisan.”\n\nWill Maine try ranked-choice voting again?\xa0\nEven as Maine becomes the first state to use ranked-choice voting statewide, it’s unclear whether it will continue to do so after the June election. When Maine voters approved a referendum to use ranked-choice voting in 2016, lawmakers voted to delay implementing it until 2021, citing concerns that it conflicted with the state’s constitution. But the law also said that if the state failed to amend the constitution by 2021 to accommodate ranked-choice voting, implementing the new system would be postponed indefinitely. Republicans sought to block using the system in the June 12 primary, but were rebuffed in both federal and state court.\nOrganizers were able to gather enough signatures to place a second referendum on the June ballot ― a “people’s veto” that would block the legislature’s move to delay implementing ranked-choice voting in other future elections.\nThe timing means that on June 12, Mainers will vote using the ranked-choice system while also voting on whether to keep using it. If the “people’s veto” passes, the system would be used in all primary elections with more than two candidates as well as in federal general elections. But absent a constitutional amendment, the system will not be used for general elections of state offices, because of the provision in the Maine Constitution that state races need to be decided by a plurality.\nThe unique timing also means ranked-choice voting advocates are engaged in a campaign to simultaneously teach people across Maine how ranked-choice voting works while also making a case to keep it. The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting and groups like the League of Women Voters have launched television advertisements and conducted mock elections on voters’ favorite beers and pizzas to show them how the system works. \nKyle Bailey, campaign manager for the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting, told HuffPost he hopes the attention surrounding the new system will encourage people to rethink the way they elect candidates. \n“I don’t think most people are familiar with the election system they have because it’s probably been used for 50, 100, 150 years,” Bailey said. “I think there’s an opportunity with what’s happening in Maine to tell the story of ‘There are different ways to go about electing our politicians.’”\nEven though ranked-choice voting is new, John Brautigam, a senior policy and legal adviser to the Maine chapter of the League of Women Voters, said he thinks it will increase trust in the electoral process amid heightened concerns about hacking and integrity. \n“It will be a general boost to the whole faith in the democratic process,” Brautigam said. “People will look at voting in a new way and they will look at campaigns in a new way that sort of goes beyond the tribalism ...They’ll expect more out of candidates and they’ll expect more out of voters.”\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

  'sub_title': 'Your favorites are coming back.',
  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies. Every Saturday, Streamline ranks the best shows to watch online, including a focus on\xa0Netflix.\n\xa0\n“Sense8: The Series Finale”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Sense8" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A group of eight people across the world realize they’re telepathically linked. Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n"The Staircase" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Queer Eye" on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n"Set It Up" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n"Luke Cage" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n"Glow" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n"Nailed It!" on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n\n\n\n\n<div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60">\n<div class="ad_share_box">\r\n<div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label">ADVERTISEMENT</div>\r\n<style>#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}</style>\r\n<div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"><div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function() {\r\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\r\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\r\n  // enableQueue: ""\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        waitForGlobal(function() {\r\n          return window.htmlAdWH && window.adSetSyncCalled;\r\n        }, function() {\r\n          // override adsPl in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // override ads NetId in template\r\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\r\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\r\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\r\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\r\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId && recoveryId.length && kraken__adBlock && kraken__adBlock.active;\r\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415661\';\r\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          // Override adtech_call_type\r\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\r\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\r\n          switch (delivery_type) {\r\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\r\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\r\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\r\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\r\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n          \r\n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\r\n\r\n          \r\n          \r\n\r\n          if(needsRecovery) {\r\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\r\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\r\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\r\n          \r\n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\r\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\r\n              if (elem && !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\r\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \r\n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\r\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 && typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n              \r\n          adSetInView(\'0\');\r\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\r\n      \r\n    \r\n   //modulous queue closing\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt></div></div>\r\n<script>\r\n(function(){\r\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\r\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\r\nfunction resize() {\r\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\r\n  if ((!ifr && box.offsetWidth > 10 && box.offsetHeight > 10) || \r\n      (ifr && ifr.offsetWidth > 10 && ifr.offsetHeight > 10)) {\r\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\r\n    label.style.display = \'\';\r\n  } else {\r\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\r\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (i=0; i<10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\r\n}());\r\n</scr+ipt>\r\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'},
 {'title': 'Betsy DeVos Says School Safety Commission Won’t Look At Role Of Guns In School Shootings',
  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nTestifying before the Senate appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said the Federal Commission on School Safety, which she chairs, will not look at the role of guns in a recent spate of school shootings.\nIn an exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy\xa0(D-Vt.), DeVos said it is “not part of the commission’s charge per se” to look at the role of firearms as it relates to gun violence. Instead, DeVos said the commission will study “school safety and how we can ensure our students are safe at school.”\nLeahy asked DeVos if she thinks an 18-year-old should be able to buy AR-15-style guns and ammunition.\n“I believe that’s very much a matter for debate, and I know that’s been debated within this body and will continue to be,” DeVos replied. “Our focus is on raising up successful proven techniques and approaches to ensuring schools are safe for students to attend.”\n\n\n\nThe White House charged DeVos with leading a federal commission on school safety after a shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February left 17 dead. In a March press release, the White House said the commission will study and make recommendations on issues including “age restrictions for certain firearm purchases.”\xa0\nHuffPost reached out to the Education Department to see if the commission still plans to make recommendations in this area, given DeVos’ comments Tuesday.\nIn response, department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill clarified that the commission will still be making such recommendations.\n“It is one of the 27 items to be addressed by the report,” Hill said in an email.\nShe also noted “that the commission cannot create or amend current gun laws — that is the Congress’ job.”\nWhile speaking with Leahy, DeVos also said the commission will not look at countries where teens spend similar amounts of time playing video games or on social media but that do not have the same high rates of gun violence in schools as the U.S.\nLeahy ended the exchange by noting that the commission “will look at gun violence in schools but not look at guns ― an interesting concept.”\nDeVos has been holding listening sessions and events for her commission in recent weeks. On Wednesday,\xa0the commission is scheduled to hold a public listening session.\xa0\n',

 {'title': 'Donald Trump’s Fight With NFL Players Has Never Been About The National Anthem',
  'body': "\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump wants the world to believe his decision to cancel a White House visit from the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles was about the team’s ― and the NFL’s ― supposed refusal to stand for the national anthem. Trump abruptly canceled the visit, which was scheduled for Tuesday, via a White House statement on Monday evening, before returning to his favorite medium to drive home his point. \n“Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!” Trump tweeted Monday night, a reference to the NFL’s new policy requiring teams and their players to stand for the national anthem or stay in the locker room while it is played before games. If the new policy was driven by the cowardice of NFL owners who wanted to appease the president, this was the latest sign they had predictably and miserably failed.\n\n\n\nBut while the Trump tweet was more red meat for his base, it was also a useful reminder that his fight with NFL players ― from the Eagles, or any other team ― has never been about the national anthem or the kneeling itself, no matter his insistence to the contrary.\nOnly one Eagles player kneeled during the anthem in 2017, before a preseason game in August. That player was cut before the season began, and not a single Philadelphia Eagle kneeled during the anthem through the entirety of the regular season. The Eagles players who protested at all during the anthem stopped once the Players Coalition, of which Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins was a vocal leader, reached an agreement with the NFL in November. No member of the Eagles or any other team protested during the anthem throughout the NFL playoffs this winter. Before the NFL revived the issue with its new policy in May, in fact, it seemed likely that the protests that had taken place over the past two seasons would not have occurred this fall.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the fact that fewer than 10 of Philadelphia’s 53 players planned to make the trip to Washington was rooted in substantive opposition to the president’s policies, words and actions. As much as Trump would like the dispute to be a culture war skirmish about the anthem and the ungrateful athletes who won’t stand for it, the Eagles players’ renunciation was about his presidency\xa0― and their lack of belief that anything positive could come from a glorified “photo op.”\xa0\nAside from one weekend of symbolic but ultimately toothless protests driven by those same scared NFL owners ―\xa0some of whom appeared next to players in a cynical show of “solidarity” against the president’s targeting of their business ― little of the sports world’s opposition to Trump, in fact, has been centered on the anthem. And hardly any of his own actions have actually concerned the song, either. Trump’s fight with the sports figures who have criticized him ― the majority of whom are black ― is not about what takes place during 100 seconds of music, but about power and fealty, and his belief that NFL players and other black athletes are displaying too much of one and not enough of the other.\nThis should have been clear from Trump’s “cancellation” of a White House visit the Golden State Warriors never planned to make last year, after superstar Stephen Curry criticized the president. It should have been clear from the White House’s fight with ESPN anchor Jemele Hill shortly thereafter, or from Trump’s blasting of LaVar Ball. No one on the Warriors had protested during the anthem; neither had Hill or Ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they had challenged the president over the views he had espoused and the policies he had sought to enact; they had pointed out (correctly) that many of those policies were based in racism and white supremacy; they had refused, in Ball’s case, to show deference to a president who hadn’t actually done anything to help Ball free his son from potential incarceration in China.\nThat hasn’t stopped Trump’s supporters and even some in the media ― especially, but not only, his friends at Fox News ― from adopting Trump’s frame that the problem with the Eagles, and with the NFL, is that this is a legitimate dispute over proper anthem protocol. But the anthem is not the issue here. Not for the majority of the NFL’s protesters, who like Jenkins want to talk about racial inequality, a racist criminal justice system, or the nearly 400 black Americans who have been killed by police since Colin Kaepernick first began his demonstration nearly two years ago. And not for Trump, who along with Vice President Mike Pence has bastardized the anthem for his own political ends, blatantly committing the same perceived crime the players stand accused of.\n\n\n\nFor the president, who may or may not even know the words to the song, the anthem is only a useful weapon in his broader campaign of silencing black athletes, black sports figures and black people who would dare challenge him. At bottom, it has nothing to do with who is and isn’t kneeling for the anthem. It’s about who is and isn’t kneeling to him.\n\n\n\n\nCarlo Allegri/Reuters\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s cancellation of a White House event to honor the Philadelphia Eagles was a reminder that his fight with the NFL has nothing to do with the national anthem.\n\n\n\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s A Reason Powerful Americans Love To Attack Black Sports Figures\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Can’t Stop Attacking Black Sports Figures\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Colin Kaepernick Have A First Amendment Case Against Donald Trump?\n\n\n\n",

  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON ― Once again, does anyone know what kind of porn Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) is watching?\nHuffPost reported last week that the 67-year-old Black, who is running for governor of Tennessee, told pastors in a private meeting that pornography is a “big part” of what is driving the spike in school shootings in recent years.\n“It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,”\xa0she said at the meeting. “All of this is available without parental guidance. I think that is a big part of the root cause.”\nWhen a TV reporter from Memphis’ Local 24 News\xa0followed up with her on Friday and asked her to explain the connection, Black stood by her claim.\n“Why is it that we’re seeing this surge of this violence with these young people? And when they’re looking at videos and they’re not getting good parental guidance?” she asked. “Why is it, 20, 25, 30 years ago, when there were just as many weapons around, that we didn’t have this happening?”\nHere’s a video clip from Local 24 News. Her comments on porn begin around the 52-second mark.\n\nSo there you have it.\xa0Per Black’s logic, porn did not exist 20 years ago,\xa0and now that it does,\xa0teenagers are buying naughty pictures at grocery stories, illegally obtaining guns and shooting up their schools.\nA request for clarification was not returned by Black’s congressional spokesman.\n',

 {'title': 'Republican Senators Are Drafting A Bill To Fight Trump On Tariffs',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― Republicans are finally standing up to President Donald Trump, but not for the reason you might think.\nRather than, say, taking action to protect the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election, GOP senators are working on a plan this week to curb the president’s authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. They argue that Trump’s recently announced steel and aluminum tariffs on U.S. allies will hamstring the nation’s humming economy and cost Americans jobs.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nProponents of the effort face a big hurdle, however ― convincing GOP leaders to support a measure that would directly challenge Trump on trade and open an intraparty clash just months before the crucial November midterm elections.\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Senate Republican, poured cold water over the prospect of reining in the president’s trade powers in interviews on Capitol Hill this week.\n“I think that is primarily an executive branch function, and I don’t really see Congress passing and getting a presidential signature on something constraining his authority,”\xa0Cornyn told reporters Monday.\nLawmakers could, of course, override a presidential veto on a potential measure that limited Trump’s ability to impose tariffs. But it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate ― a gargantuan task in the sharply divided Congress.\xa0\nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who is spearheading the effort alongside Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), said he received a “very positive” reaction from members when he brought up the matter during a weekly GOP caucus lunch Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence, who was also in the room, did not react or make any comment, Corker said.\nThe retiring Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman is planning on introducing a bill challenging Trump’s tariffs on imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The measure would curtail the president’s authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to levy tariffs based on “national security grounds” ―\xa0a provision Trump has invoked several times.\xa0\n“What this would do is redefine that and say that the president would go through the same steps that he goes through, but at the end of the day, if he decides that he wants to put tariffs in place, Congress would have to approve those,”\xa0Corker said Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorker declined to say how many senators supported the legislation but said that was working with “a big list” of Republicans and Democrats.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a China trade hawk who has openly supported Trump’s policies with respect to the communist nation, said Tuesday he was waiting to see the bill before commenting on it.\n“I told him to send me the bill,” Schumer said during a weekly press briefing. “I haven’t seen it yet.”\nThe effort to push back on Trump’s tariffs follows sharp criticism and even retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports from leaders in the European Union, Canada and Mexico on American products from steel to pork and bourbon.\xa0\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Trump’s recent tariffs on imported vehicles over the weekend, stating that he found it “insulting” that his administration views Canada ― a longtime U.S. ally ― as a national security risk.\n“The fact that the president has moved forward with these tariffs is not just going to hurt Canadian jobs, it’s going to hurt U.S. jobs as well and neither of those things is something Canada wants to see,” Trudeau said.\nTrump defended his actions on trade Monday,\xa0arguing that the U.S. farm industry will benefit overall in the future as a result of his policies.\n\n\n\nCorker said he is considering offering his bill as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a defense spending bill Congress must pass each year. Doing so would give it the best opportunity for passage this year, given that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remains opposed to allowing a vote on the trade measure as a standalone bill.\n“The NDAA is going to be open, we’ll see what amendments are offered,” McConnell said Tuesday when asked about the Corker bill.\nOther GOP senators, however, seemed more skeptical about the prospect of attaching an unrelated measure to a must-pass defense bill, arguing that such a strategy risked holding up funding for the military.\n“I’m not sure the NDAA is the right vehicle,” Cornyn said Tuesday. “I don’t know how he\xa0[Trump] might respond to that, and we really have to pass the NDAA.”\nSen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), meanwhile, argued that it would be unwise to limit the president’s ability to unilaterally impose tariffs at a time when China is aggressively exerting its influence on the world stage.\n“Yes, I agree that the legislative branch gave up a lot of authority in 1962 but the world’s different,” he said, referring to the Trade Expansion Act. “My first reaction to that is we need to protect the executive branch to move quickly and have flexibility.”\n",

 {'title': 'Philadelphia Eagles And NFL Players Hit Back At Trump’s Disinvitation',
  'body': "\nCurrent and former NFL players hit back at President Donald Trump\xa0on Tuesday, calling him “cowardly” and asking when he will be impeached, after he\xa0abruptly disinvited\xa0the Philadelphia Eagles from a White House event.\nThe Trump administration released a statement Monday night that implied the players were not welcome at the White House celebration of the Super Bowl champion team planned for Tuesday. Trump, in a tweet late Monday night, reiterated the decision,\xa0citing athletes’ protests\xa0during the national anthem and the small number of Eagles players who planned to attend as reasons for the last-minute cancellation.\nWide receiver Torrey Smith, who played for the Eagles last season, spoke out against the president in a series of tweets, saying the issue was never about standing for the national anthem.\xa0\nEagles players were not among the NFL athletes who took a knee or remained in the locker room during the 2017 regular season while the national anthem was played, according to ESPN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don’t want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish,” he tweeted.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith had previously said that he would not be attending the event at Trump’s White House. In a statement shared Monday night by Dave Zirin of The Nation, Smith explained that his decision was because of Trump’s record of disrespect toward women, minority groups and Smith’s peers.\n\n\n\nMalcolm Jenkins, safety for the Eagles, released a statement on Tuesday that defended him and his teammates against what he described as a smear attack by those who question their patriotism.\nJenkins, in addition to mentioning that Eagles defensive end Chris Long donated his entire salary last year to charity, shared a list of charitable acts he and his fellow teammates have accomplished.\n“No one elected us to do this. We do it because we love this country and our communities. Everyone, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, deserves to be treated equally. We are fighting for racial and social equality,” he said.\nInstead of his teammates being recognized for their good work, Jenkins said, “the decision was made to lie, and paint the picture that these players are anti-America, anti-flag and anti-military.”\n\n\n\nThe NFL Players Association also said it is “disappointed” by Trump’s decision.\xa0\n“NFL players love their country, support our troops, give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place,” it said in a statement.\n\n\n\nTight end\xa0Zach Ertz\xa0and Long spoke out against Fox News’ coverage of the president’s announcement after the network showed photos of Eagles players kneeling ― but doing so in prayer, not during the national anthem. Fox News later\xa0apologized,\xa0admitting its coverage included “unrelated footage.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErtz slammed the network for using athletes’ prayer as “propaganda.” Long called it a “please the boss” effort that misrepresented Christian men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong also shared a point similar to Smith’s in which he said “most players” who wanted to skip the White House visit had made their decision before the NFL made it mandatory for players to stand during the anthem.\n\n\n\nFormer Eagles wide receiver Cris Carter suggested in light of Trump’s decision that former President Barack Obama “should invite the Eagles to his house for a barbecue” instead. That idea drew more than 100,000 likes.\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney also spoke out about the president’s cancellation, saying it “only proves that our President is not a true patriot.”\n“These are players who stand up for the causes they believe in and who contribute in meaningful ways to their community. They represent the diversity of our nation ― a nation in which we are free to express our opinions,” he said in a statement. “Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our President is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend.”\n\n\n\nOther football players, both current and retired, also joined in with responses to Trump’s decision.\xa0Joshua Norman, cornerback for the Washington NFL team, tweeted: “Why is this impeachment taking so Damn Long.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  'body': '\nDavid Koch, who with his brother Charles has built a powerful conservative political network, is stepping down from his family’s conglomerate and his leadership of Americans for Prosperity, the network’s signature political organization.\nThe 78-year-old is retiring due to declining health, his brother wrote to Koch Industries employees Tuesday. In October 2016, David Koch announced to employees that his health was declining and he had been hospitalized over the summer.\xa0\n“Unfortunately, these issues have not been resolved and his health has continued to deteriorate,” Charles Koch wrote in the letter. “As a result, he is unable to be involved in business and other organizational activities.”\nThe Koch brothers have used their political network to move the Republican Party and the whole of American politics in a libertarian direction, and David Koch was the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee in 1980. They have founded and heavily funded multiple groups backing the Republican Party and conservative ideas, becoming the bête noire of many Democrats.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two brothers are among America’s wealthiest men, with Forbes magazine recently estimating their net worth to be about $52 billion\xa0 each. Koch Industries is the United States’ second-largest privately held company and makes everything from toilet paper to fertilizer.\xa0\nMark Holden, the chairman of Kochs’ donor network, confirmed David Koch’s resignation from Americans for Prosperity.\xa0\n“Due to health reasons, David Koch will be resigning from the board of Americans for Prosperity Foundation,” Holden said. “We greatly appreciate his vital role on the board and all that he has done to help us build a strong foundation for our future success.”\xa0\nDavid Koch has also donated hundreds of millions to apolitical causes, including $185 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his alma mater, and $150 million to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\xa0\nIt’s unclear how David Koch’s retirement will change the brothers’ political activities, if at all. In an April interview with the conservative Washington Examiner, Charles Koch described the difference between the two brothers: “David is a much better engineer than I am and is much more into the arts and social life. Obviously he’s got to be or he wouldn’t live in Manhattan. And David is much more into elective politics than I am.”\xa0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the estimated wealth of the Koch brothers as $80 billion each.\n\n\n\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters\n\n\n\n',

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is running for attorney general of Minnesota, setting off a potentially history-making battle that is sure to attract national attention.\nHe officially filed the paperwork for his candidacy on Tuesday afternoon.\nIn a statement explaining his decision, Ellison promised to continue the work he began in Congress fighting for consumer rights, labor rights, immigrant rights,\xa0antitrust reform and a clean environment.\n“I am running to be the People’s Lawyer to hold those in power accountable and to protect and defend all Minnesotans,” he said.\n\n\n\nEllison, one of the staunchest progressives in Congress and the current deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, would likely be the first Muslim statewide elected official in the country’s history. Ellison was the first-ever Muslim member of Congress when he took office in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe six-term Minneapolis congressman would also be one of Minnesota’s first black statewide officials. (Alan Page, a black attorney and former professional football player, was elected to the state’s supreme court in 1992.)\n“Keith Ellison continues to create watershed moments for the American Muslim community with his ascension in American politics,” said Robert McCaw, government affairs director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. (McCaw believes that Ellison would be the country’s first Muslim statewide elected official, but could not say so with certainty.)\nThe election is likely to test the versatility of Ellison’s progressive convictions and unique background on considerably more conservative and less diverse terrain than his reliably liberal home district.\nAlthough the current attorney general, Lori Swanson, is a Democrat, she hails from the blue-collar Iron Range and holds more moderate views than Ellison.\nSwanson on Monday announced she would run for governor\xa0after the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party convention declined to endorse her re-election at its Saturday\xa0convention.\nThe DFL, as the Democratic Party is known in Minnesota, decided to back the more progressive challenger Matt Pelikan for attorney general.\nBut Pelikan, 36, lacks major legal or political experience, creating the space for a more experienced challenger.\nEllison’s decision to run is motivated as much by the availability of the post as by his desire to marshal the forces of the state to resist the agenda of President Donald Trump, according to a Democrat familiar with his thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEllison, 54, practiced law in Minneapolis from 1990 to 2007, when he began his tenure as a member of Congress. He spent the bulk of his legal career at Minneapolis’ Legal Rights Center, a nonprofit that provided legal defense to the city’s underprivileged minority communities. He developed a reputation for employing assertive legal tactics to help his clients, including filing multiple motions at a time on relatively small claims matters, according to a Mother Jones profile.\nEllison also faces former Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch, a more moderate competitor, in the DFL primary on Aug. 14.\nIf Ellison prevails in the primary, he will likely face state Rep. Doug Wardlow, the attorney general candidate endorsed by the Minnesota Republican Party.\nEllison plans to stay on as second-in-command at the DNC. DNC Chairman Tom Perez named him to the newly created post after prevailing in a closely fought race for the chairmanship that mobilized competing wings of the party.\n“I have come to know Keith as someone who is passionate about finding every possible way to help the greatest number of Americans achieve a better quality of life,” Perez said in a statement about Ellison’s bid. “And I have witnessed that passion in every single decision he has made,\xa0including whether to continue the fight in Congress or to run and serve as Minnesota’s chief law enforcement official.”\xa0\nHowever, while Ellison has publicly professed his satisfaction with his role as deputy chair, he has privately chafed under Perez’s leadership, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking.\nIn October, Perez removed several Ellison backers from DNC leadership posts.\xa0Perez also recently endorsed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) against Ellison’s wishes.\nEllison’s decision not to seek re-election for Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District has prompted several new candidates to jump into the race before the filing deadline at the end of the day on Tuesday.\nThe contender with the most national name recognition is state Rep.

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is more or less assured a place in California’s general election after the state votes Tuesday. The race to challenge her, however, remains relatively up for grabs. Most polls of the state’s crowded open primary\xa0find progressive Kevin de León the most likely competitor, but a sizable chunk of the electorate, especially on the GOP side, remains undecided.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this spring, one survey suggested that the person going up against her could be an obscure neo-Nazi named Patrick Little. The online poll from the firm SurveyUSA had Little taking second place behind Feinstein with 18 percent of the vote. The finding, which wasn’t reflected in other surveys, still made a flurry of headlines, prompting swift denunciations from the GOP and a round of anti-Semitic robocalls directed at the senator by a white supremacist group.\nThe end result: an inconsequential, hate-spewing candidate got a round of unexpected publicity that may have, if anything, boosted his name recognition in a race with no real Republican frontrunners.\nBut Little’s supposed rise was a quirk of the poll’s design, not an actual groundswell of support. Over the course of the year, SurveyUSA had gradually pared down the “weakest, non-performing candidates” from previous polls. In January, they polled 20 candidates and found Little at just 5 percent, tied for third place with two other little-known Republicans. In March, out of a field of 17, he was again tied for third at 5 percent. In April, with just six names listed ― and with Little and perennial candidate Rocky De La Fuente the only two Republicans ― he jumped to 18 percent.\nIn their final poll, the survey house reverted to a question that more closely mirrors the California ballot, listing all 32 candidates along with their titles and party IDs, a change that they said in a statement “reflect SurveyUSA’s best current methodological thinking.” Little’s support plunged to 0.\nFiguring out which candidates to include is a tricky question for pollsters in nearly every election, but it’s an especially colorful problem in California, where a faithful recreation of the ballot means including longshot candidates with occupations like “puppeteer/musician,” “entrepreneur/transhumanist lecturer” and “blockchain startup CEO,” alongside those with jobs like “lieutenant governor” and “United States Senator.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying to reflect the ballot as closely as possible might seem like the obvious solution. But research has found, for instance, that listing third-party candidates on a survey tends to over-exaggerate their share of the vote, while omitting them understates it. And that’s to say nothing of the challenges faced by pollsters using telephone surveys, who understandably tend to shy away from the idea of having their interviewers read dozens of names and titles over the phone.\nHere’s how some of the other pollsters working in California handled the issue:\n-The Public Policy Institute of California, which conducts polling by phone, narrowed down the list to “serious” candidates, a process the pollsters have honed going back to the state’s 2003 gubernatorial recall. The criteria, said Mark Baldassare, PPIC’s president and CEO, required candidates to have some financial resources ― at least $100,000 by May ― along with a campaign website, credible endorsements and “some level of media coverage.” That meant a field of six for California’s gubernatorial race, and of just two, Feinstein and De Leon, on the Senate side. Very few survey respondents this year, Baldassare said, have volunteered that they’ll be voting for someone else. PPIC’s May poll found Feinstein leading De Leon, 41 percent to 17 percent, with 36 percent undecided.\n-The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, which is conducted using an online panel, tried to make their survey mimic the ballot as closely as possible. “We were happy to be able to do this because, generally speaking, polling gets a lot of criticism from minor candidates,” said Jill Darling, the survey’s director. “They always say, ‘Well, if you were polling us, you’d see that we have support.’ So we were happy to be able to let anyone who had a preference for anybody on the ballot participate.” Their final survey gave Feinstein 31 percent and De Leon 7 percent, with the remaining candidates polling below 4 percent and 41 percent of voters still undecided.\n-The Berkeley IGS poll, which is also conducted online, included the full list of candidates as well. “We had a sense that there’d be lots of candidates running,” poll director Mark DiCamillo said. “We wanted a method that would enable us to get a sense of how voters would choose in that environment.” Limiting the candidate list, he argued, would also have worked perfectly well in races ranging from the 2003 recall up through this year’s gubernatorial race, but the lack of a strong GOP contender made it a trickier proposition on the Senate side. “The Republicans didn’t know what to do ― it’s very artificial.” The final Berkeley poll put Feinstein at 36 percent, with de Leon at 11 percent and Republican James Bradley at 7 percent. A quarter of voters were undecided.\nThe good news for California pollsters: come the general election, there’ll only be two candidates to worry about. But the top-two format offers other quirks. If Republicans get locked out of the top-of-the-ticket contests, a feat that doesn’t seem impossible, many Republicans may simply decide not to weigh in.\nIn 2016, when two Democrats faced off for Senate, Baldassare said, nearly two million people voted for president but not in the senatorial race. “So that’s the interesting twist,” he said, “in the one-party races: how do you evaluate those ‘don’t-know’s’ or ‘I-won’t-vote’s.’”\n',

The jury was deadlocked on a single misdemeanor charge of engaging in a riot. The judge told the jury to continue deliberating on the charges against the other two defendants at trial.\nPREVIOUSLY:\xa0\nWASHINGTON ― A D.C. jury deciding the fate of three people facing felony charges in connection with destruction during protests against President Donald Trump’s inauguration appears to be deadlocked.\nThe jury foreman wrote a note to the judge on Tuesday, saying jurors couldn’t reach a verdict on any count and that their views seemed unlikely to change.\nThe government originally charged more than 200 people with\nfelonies,\nbut has yet to convict any defendant at trial.\xa0Forty-seven individuals are still facing felonies, including the three defendants currently on trial.\xa0\nAfter closing arguments last week,\xa0a juror passed a note to the judge saying she had seen graffiti in a bathroom stall reading “Google jury nullification,” referring to the concept of jurors voting defendants not guilty because they don’t support a law or the potential punishment for the crime. The juror said she had looked up the term,\xa0then discussed jury nullification with other jurors.\nThe concept of jury nullification could be particularly powerful in this trial because of the severity of the charges and the potential penalties against defendants who might otherwise be facing only misdemeanors.\nIf the jury convicts the defendants of conspiracy to riot, they could be held responsible for several counts of felony destruction of property even if they didn’t personally destroy the property. Theoretically, the defendants could face decades in prison if convicted on all charges, although such a sentence is unlikely.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nJury Finds Yet Another Trump Inauguration Protester Not Guilty Of Felony Charges\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Inauguration Charges Dismissed Because Prosecutors Withheld Evidence\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Prosecutors Still Trying To Turn Trump Inauguration Protesters Into Felons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Horton beat incumbent Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin in Alabama’s GOP primary election on Tuesday, following reports that Entrekin was pocketing money intended to feed inmates in the local county jail he oversees.\nHorton announced he’d received a call from Entrekin on Tuesday night conceding the election. \nWith no Democratic candidates on the ballot, Horton now becomes the new county sheriff. He celebrated by holding up a T-shirt that read, “There’s A New Sheriff In Town.”\n\n\n\nAL.com reported in March that Entrekin had kept more $750,000 of the food budget of the Etowah County jail he oversaw. According to AL.com, Entrekin kept a personal account he called his “Food Provision” fund that contained money allocated by federal, state and municipal governments to feed the jail’s inmates. \nInstead of using the money for its intended purpose, Entrekin admitted to AL.com that he kept the money for himself.\nEntrekin had been taking advantage of Alabama state law allowing sheriffs to keep any excess taxpayer dollars intended to feed inmates in their jails.\xa0He is one of 49 Alabama sheriffs named in a January lawsuit by two civil rights groups, the Southern Center for Human Rights and Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, alleging abuse of the state’s law. \nThe civil rights groups said in their suit that they were concerned about the sheriffs converting jail food funds for their own personal use,\xa0since the law creates a “perverse incentive”\xa0for the sheriffs to spend as little as possible on food for inmates.\nIn response to the headlines that AL.com’s reporting generated, Entrekin claimed he was a victim of “fake news” and said that while the inmates don’t like the food being served in his jail, the meals are designed by a licensed dietitian. \n',

CNN reported that he was employed as a contractor for the National Security Council and that his badge only gave him access to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, but not the West Wing.\n“Edwards was promptly arrested by Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers at a checkpoint outside of the White House complex when he was reporting to work as a contractor. Edwards was transported to MPD Second District for processing,” the Secret Service said in a statement provided to CBS News.\nEdwards, 29, had a warrant issued for his arrest on May 17. The Secret Service did not say what charges he faces, although authorities told The Washington Post that a man with the same name was wanted for attempted first-degree murder.\nEdwards has been charged with being a fugitive from justice and could be extradited to Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Gov.\xa0Gavin Newsom\xa0and Republican businessman John Cox\xa0placed first and second, respectively, in California’s gubernatorial primary Tuesday, according to projections from Fox News and NBC, easing Republican fears that their party would be entirely shut out of the general election in November.\xa0\nNewsom and Cox competed in a crowded field to replace outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown (D) in the state’s “jungle” primary, in which the top two vote-getters advance to the general election. Other candidates included former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D), state Treasurer John Chiang (D), former state public schools chief Delanie Eastin (D) and state Assemblyman Travis Allen (R).\nAs the results of the primary were called Tuesday evening, Villaraigosa asked officials to keep some polling stations in Los Angeles County open through Friday because of a printing error that had left more than 118,000 names off the voter rolls. “We’ve been told that a number of people were turned away and weren’t allowed to cast a provisional ballot,” he said at his election night event. “We’ve got to figure that out.”\xa0\nLater in the evening, Villaraigosa conceded the race and threw his support behind Newsom.\xa0\nNewsom announced his candidacy in February 2015 — more than three years before the primary — and has dominated the race in both the polls and fundraising ever since. He’s widely expected to defeat Cox in the general election: Republicans haven’t won a statewide race in California since 2006, and the GOP businessman is not nearly as well known statewide as the lieutenant governor. Cox is also a relatively recent California transplant, having lived in Chicago most of his life, and has never been elected to public office.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsom pitched himself to voters as a bold advocate for California and offered support for progressive policies like Medicare for all and universal preschool while looking to convince more moderate voters he’d continue in Brown’s budget-conscious path. He’s also said he’d be a more pro-active governor than Brown, who largely does not comment on legislation until it’s time for him to sign or veto it.\xa0\n“I’m going to pull a lot more things into the governor’s office and not just see them fester in the Legislature,” Newsom told reporters last week.\nCox, meanwhile,\xa0has vowed to reform the state’s taxation system if elected, particularly taking issue with the state’s high income taxes. He’s also taken on the state’s gas tax — a favorite punching bag of California Republicans — as well as California’s newly implemented “sanctuary” state policy. He’s also pushed a plan to reduce the size of the state’s legislative districts, which he’s argued would reduce corruption by cutting down on the need for special interest money in campaigns.\xa0\nFor most of the campaign, Villaraigosa was seen as the most viable threat to Newsom’s candidacy. He has strong ties to Southern California, having served as Los Angeles mayor for two terms, and serving on the Los Angeles City Council as well as in the California Assembly prior to that. Newsom, who was the mayor of San Francisco before assuming his current statewide post, is a Bay Area native with a deep support base in the northern part of the state.\xa0\nVillaraigosa, who is Mexican-American, also had strong support from Latino voters, who made up roughly 18 percent of likely voters.\xa0\nBut in the last month of the campaign, Cox, a San Diego County resident who supported Libertarian Gary Johnson in the 2016 presidential race, earned the support of President Donald Trump, which pushed him over the edge to best Villaraigosa in the race for second place.\xa0\nTrump’s endorsement, however, may work against Cox in the general election: In a statewide UC Berkeley IGS Poll conducted in April, just 31 percent of voters said they approved of the president’s job performance.\nCalifornia’s top-two primary system prompted some unusual maneuvers in the late stages of the campaign. Hoping for the opportunity to run against a Republican rather than waging a costly campaign against a fellow Democrat, Newsom’s campaign ran “attack ads” against Cox that likely endeared GOP voters to the businessman by playing up his ties to the National Rifle Association as well as his Trump endorsement.\xa0\nA super PAC supporting Villaraigosa’s campaign, meanwhile, spent more than $1 million boosting Allen’s candidacy in hopes of splitting the GOP vote.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nGetty Images; Reuters\n\n\nJohn Cox, a Republican businessman, and Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor, are projected to be the rivals for California governor in November.\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nBig Tobacco appeared to take a blow Tuesday night as San Franciscans were projected to move forward with a city ordinance outlawing the sale of flavored tobacco and nicotine products.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle called the vote Tuesday evening with over half of city precincts reporting results.\xa0\nProposition E, which asked voters whether the sale of products like menthol cigarettes or cotton candy-flavored e-cigarettes should continue in San Francisco,\xa0was funded by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company after the city’s Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a ban on such products last year. Voters decided Tuesday to let the ordinance go forward, siding with health advocates who say the flavored products target children.\xa0\n“Tobacco products are flavored to taste like candy, fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, cocoa, menthol, mint, win\xadtergreen, herb, or spice and many of the packages are designed to look\xa0exactly\xa0like popular kids candies like Sour Patch kids, Jolly Ranchers and Gummy Bears,” the ban’s supporters wrote in an appeal to voters.\nGroups who supported the sale restrictions included the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nDavid Becker/Reuters\n\n\nAttendees at the Vape Summit 3 in Las Vegas sample vape pens alongside e-cigarette liquid packaged to look like Cracker Jack candy.\n\n\n\nThe ban’s inclusion of flavored e-cigarettes, which contain nicotine but not tobacco,\xa0sparked some debate. Advocates for including them in the ban pointed to\xa0research\xa0finding that youths who smoke e-cigarettes are more likely to pick up a tobacco cigarette habit. The Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, says that likelihood is\xa0increased\xa0by a factor of three or four.\nBut those against such a broad ban said flavored e-cigarettes encourage conventional smokers to transition to the tobacco-free option, which is perceived to be safer. However, the\xa0U.S. surgeon general warns\xa0that e-cigarettes are just as addictive as regular ones and can still contain chemicals linked to lung disease, heavy metals and other components potentially harmful to one’s health.\nThe ban’s critics focused more on claims that such an ordinance would have other unforeseen consequences and be as ineffective as past attempts at alcohol and marijuana prohibition.\n“Prohibition leads to underground markets and crime,” the ordinance’s opponents wrote in their official argument. “When politicians banned alcohol, it happened. When they banned cannabis, we got a decades-long ‘War on Drugs’ with mass incarceration.”\nSanta Clara County and Oakland, both near San Francisco, have passed similar laws. The Food and Drug Administration is also considering a broader ban on flavored tobacco and nicotine products.\xa0\n',

And final tallies could take weeks.\xa0\nThe question of who advances is most crucial in California’s 39th, 48th and 49th Congressional Districts, where a glut of Democratic candidates has the party fearing it could be locked out of a Republican vs. Republican general election. A lockout could hurt Democratic chances of winning the U.S. House in November.\nBut early returns might not be indicative of the final results. In the 2016 primary, nearly 60 percent of voters cast their ballot by mail ― and the ballots, which can be postmarked as late as election day, don’t even need to arrive until Friday to be counted.\nIn the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had a 13-point lead on election night. After every ballot was counted, she defeated Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont by just 7 percentage points.\xa0\nIn the general election in 2016, it took nearly three weeks for The Associated Press to declare GOP Rep. Darrell Issa the winner over Democrat Doug Applegate. Issa won by just over 1,500 votes.\xa0\nWith multiple serious candidates running in each district, the margins between second and third place could be tight, so don’t expect news organizations to make final calls quickly.\xa0\nAdding to the confusion? The names of about 120,000 voters in Los Angeles County were left off the voter rolls, according to the Los Angeles Times. That’s equal to about 2 percent of all of the voters in the county. Voters were supposed to be allowed to cast a provisional ballot if their name wasn’t on the rolls.\nHeck, even the Fonz had to cast a provisional ballot.\xa0\n\n\n\n',

Finkenauer, currently a member of the Iowa House of Representatives, overcame three other candidates for the state’s 1st District.\nBoth will face incumbent Republican candidates holding vulnerable seats in Congress in the November midterm elections, but the two women have garnered widespread support in Iowa and the country at large. Axne and Finkenauer have each secured endorsements from the progressive political action group EMILY’s List and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations.\n“We did it! I’m honored to be your Democratic nominee for #IA03,” Axne wrote on Twitter after the primary was called. “Everyone played a critical role in this victory & I couldn’t be more grateful for your support.”\xa0\n\n\n\nFinkenauer posted her own note to social media, saying she was “honored to be your nominee in the First District.”\n\n\n\nIf either wins in November, they would become the first woman or women Iowa has sent to the U.S. House in history. And Finkenauer, at age 29, would be the youngest woman ever sent to Congress in the country’s history.\xa0Sen. Joni Ernst (R) became the first woman sent to Congress\xa0from Iowa in the 2014 midterm elections.\nAxne and Finkenauer’s candidacy is emblematic of a growing wave of women running for public office this year, and a record number filed to run for U.S. House seats in 2018.\n',

Tester has proved a thorn in Trump’s side, and toppling Tester is one of the president’s top priorities in this year’s Senate battles.\nThe Montana race is one of the crucial battles in the fight for Senate control. Republicans want to add to the 51 seats they hold in the 100-member chamber, targeting Tester and nine other Democrats in states Trump won. Democrats hope to pick up seats in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Texas. A Tester loss would deal a serious blow to any hopes the Democrats have of gaining a Senate majority.\xa0\nRosendale defeated former judge Russ Fagg, businessman and Air Force veteran Troy Downing and state Sen. Albert Olszewski to win his party’s nomination. He had the backing of the Club for Growth and GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\xa0\nThe Club for Growth aired ads attacking Fagg and Downing, Rosendale’s two main rivals in Tuesday’s vote. Rosendale focused on positive advertising, selling himself as a political outsider in the mold of Trump.\xa0\n“Montana needs a conservative who’s willing to back the Trump agenda, and not kowtow to [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi,” Rosendale said in one ad, in which he also kicked a TV with Tester’s face on it into the mud.\xa0\n\nIn other ads, he boasted of cutting his auditor office’s budget and backed Trump’s hardline\xa0immigration policies.\xa0\nRosendale’s campaign hopes to benefit from Trump’s pledge to defeat Tester after the senator, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, played a key role in sinking the nomination of White House Doctor Ronny Jackson to lead the Veterans’ Affairs Department.\nMontana Democrats have made clear they plan to attack Rosendale, who was born and raised in Maryland, as a carpetbagger. They’ve questioned his credentials as a rancher and dubbed him “Maryland Matt.”\nA new digital ad from the Democratic group American Bridge features one of his GOP primary opponents, Fagg, attacking Rosendale.\xa0\n″They don’t trust Matt Rosendale,” the ad concludes. “Neither can Montana.\n\n',

  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― There’s plenty of evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system. But there’s another piece to this that hasn’t been detailed until now: Judges nominated by Republican presidents give black defendants harsher sentences.\nAn exhaustive new Harvard study analyzed data on more than half a million defendants and about 1,400 U.S. district court judges over 15 years.\xa0It found that, compared with Democrat-nominated judges, GOP-nominated judges sentence black defendants to three more months than\xa0nonblack defendants for similar crimes.\n“These differences cannot be explained by other judge characteristics and grow substantially larger when judges are granted more discretion,” concludes the study, which was first reported last week by The New York Times.\nIt’s too early to tell what effect, if any, President Donald Trump’s judges are having on racial disparities in sentencing. But given that some of his judicial nominees have records of being racist, and others have extreme views on crime and punishment, civil rights advocates say the study’s findings only add to their concerns that black people won’t be treated fairly by Trump’s judges.\n“Trump’s judicial nominees in particular are demonstrating what we see as a breathtaking hostility toward equal rights,” said Todd Cox, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\nTake Thomas Farr, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. He drafted North Carolina’s voter suppression law, defended racially discriminatory gerrymandering and may have lied to the Senate\xa0about his role in disenfranchising black voters when he worked for the late Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nWendy Vitter and Andrew Oldham, two other pending judicial nominees, refused to say during their confirmation hearings if they supported the outcome of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 ruling that struck down school segregation.\n“I found it very revealing and scary in light of her record,” Kristine Lucius, executive vice president for policy at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said of Vitter’s non-response on the issue.\n\n\n\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images\n\n\nBrown v. Board of Education? That landmark\xa0ruling that ended school segregation? Wendy Vitter, who’s in line to become a lifetime federal judge, said she had no thoughts on the case.\n\n\n\nVitter, who is\xa0awaiting Senate confirmation\xa0to the\xa0U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, has also\xa0been criticized\xa0for buying a house in 2004 with a deed stating the house could only be sold “to people of the white race.”\xa0She and her husband, former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.),\xa0said they were not aware of the racially restrictive covenant.\n“Brown v. Board of Education is just one of those things that people don’t hedge on,”\xa0Lucius said. “I have to read it in the context of her record: She is an extreme ideologue.”\nOne of Trump’s judges couldn’t say if racial bias exists at all in the criminal justice system. Michael Brennan, whom Republicans\xa0confirmed last month\xa0to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, stunned Democrats during his confirmation hearing by\xa0refusing to answer that question. He had already been a county trial judge for nine years.\n“You’re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal justice system?” asked an incredulous Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). “I find this astonishing.”\nElectric shocks for prisoners?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of Trump’s other confirmed judges have taken harsh positions on criminal justice.\nStephanos Bibas, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, once advocated punishing prisoners with “non-disfiguring corporal punishment, such as electric shocks.” Kyle Duncan, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, defended mandatory life sentences for minors with no possibility for parole. Kevin Newsom, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, has argued that the execution of minors doesn’t violate the Constitution.\n“In fact, the Trump administration is naming judges with the express purpose of being harsher on criminal defendants who are coming to the courts,” said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, a left-leaning judicial advocacy group.\nA major factor in all this, she argued, is that Trump hasn’t picked any criminal defense lawyers or public defenders to be judges ― people who have a richer understanding of the criminal justice system. Instead, Trump is going to great lengths to nominate people for ideological reasons or because of their ties to conservative groups like the Federalist Society, she said.\n“It’s hardly surprising that they will in the future rule against individuals who are in the criminal justice system or on the civil rights plank,” said Aron.\n\n\n\n\nCSPAN\n\n\nStephanos Bibas, now a lifetime judge on\xa0the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, said in his confirmation hearing he now thinks it was a bad idea to call for electric shocks for prisoners. OK, great!\n\n\n\nTrump has been nominating judges at a breakneck pace, and Senate Republicans have broken records in their race to confirm them. To date, Trump has confirmed\xa021 circuit court judges ― more than any other president, ever, at this point in their presidency ― as well as 18 district judges and a Supreme Court justice.\nThe Harvard study estimated that a Republican president has the potential over four years to alter the partisan composition of district courts by more than 15 percentage points, potentially increasing the racial disparities in sentencing by 7.5 percent.\nBut Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and an expert on judicial nominations, said it’s tricky to gauge how much Trump’s judges will exacerbate racial inequality in the justice system.\nFor one thing,\xa0Tobias said, Trump has been heavily focused on confirming circuit court judges, and the study only looked at district court judges.\xa0And while the president’s circuit court picks are very conservative, his district court picks may not be as extreme. The White House is largely deferring to home-state senators to pick these nominees, he said, and senators “seem to stress competence.”\nStill, Tobias said he understands why many are worried that Trump’s judges may perpetuate\xa0sentencing disparities “at least as troubling” as the existing ones the new study found. One area worth close attention, he said, is how\xa0the president’s judges rule in cases involving LGBTQ matters, since nearly\xa0one-third of Trump’s picks\xa0have records of being anti-LGBTQ.\n“It will be important to monitor Trump judges’ rulings on LGBT issues to detect whether there will be disparities in this area that resemble those involving race and gender,” he said.\n",

Jeff Van Drew easily won the Democratic nomination for New Jersey’s 2nd Congressional District on Tuesday, pleasing Democratic officials who backed him and disappointing progressive activists wary of his voting record.\nVan Drew, who has represented the southernmost tip of New Jersey in the state Legislature for the past 16 years, is no ordinary moderate.\nThe 64-year-old dentist has taken positions on a range of social and economic issues that are far outside the Democratic mainstream. He has voted against basic gun control measures, legalizing same-sex marriage and increasing the state’s minimum wage above the federal minimum of $7.25.\nHe has also backed legislation withdrawing New Jersey from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and a state constitutional amendment requiring parental notification for abortions.\nBut when veteran Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo announced his plans to retire, national and state Democratic officials encouraged Van Drew to jump in, reasoning that he would have the least trouble of any Democrat with the district’s Republican-leaning voters.\nThat was not a bad bet, according to Brigid Harrison, a New Jersey politics expert at Montclair State University.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“Van Drew’s victory is indicative of the importance of political parties in New Jersey, and this is a clear win, not just for Sen. Van Drew, but for Democrats in the district because it makes it quite likely they will take this congressional seat from the Republicans,” Harrison said. \nBut some of the district’s Democrats might be less motivated to turn out for Van Drew in light of his conservative voting record and the state and national parties’ decision to back him in lieu of more progressive contenders.\nAlison Arne, a preschool teacher and co-chair of the Atlantic County chapter of the progressive group Action Together New Jersey, is one of them. Arne, who will vote third party or leave the top of the ballot blank, said she does not want to continue to “enable” what she considers the Democratic Party’s unduly cautious, donor-centered political approach when it has repeatedly failed to yield results for struggling residents of her working-class district.\n“My job at Action Together New Jersey is to bring in voters and support candidates and to go full force and make change. But I just don’t know how I can look people in the eye and tell them to vote for him when I know I can’t,” she said.\xa0\nVan Drew defeated three more progressive rivals: Tanzie Youngblood, a retired African-American teacher; Will Cunningham, an openly gay African-American attorney and former Obama administration official; and Nate Kleinman, a left-leaning farmer and nonprofit executive. \nVan Drew prevailed with the help of southern New Jersey’s Democratic political machine, run by state power broker George Norcross III. \nHe also vastly outraised his Democratic competitors with a haul that topped $631,000. Major contributors included the campaign of Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.); Hoyer’s\xa0AmeriPAC; the New Democrat PAC, which supports business-friendly Democrats; and the Blue Dog PAC, which backs centrist Democrats.\nVan Drew will now face Republican Seth Grossman, an attorney and veteran conservative activist who defeated two better-funded rivals on Tuesday.\nIn a district that Trump won by less than 5 percentage points, Grossman might well be too hardline to win.\xa0Well before Grossman’s upset, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio,), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, let slip that the district was something of a “recruiting hole” for the GOP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossman last won an election in 1988 ― for Atlantic County freeholder. He also had a meager $10,810 in cash on hand at the end of his campaign.\n\nThere have been a lot of people who have gotten engaged this year, and what they wanted is not what Van Drew has offered.\nAlison Arne\n\nBut Arne does not see that as a given. Grossman’s unexpected primary win is more evidence to her that Democratic leaders have misread the political tea leaves. Democratic and Republican voters both want political outsiders, she maintained.\n“I feel like it’s 2016 again, when they weren’t listening,” said Arne, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary and Hillary Clinton in the general election. “There have been a lot of people who have gotten engaged this year, and what they wanted is not what Van Drew has offered.”\nArne, who supported Youngblood, was disappointed both with Van Drew’s conservative record and with his disregard for the district’s energized progressive activists. His campaign did not respond to an invitation to a February candidate forum co-hosted by ATNJ and South Jersey Women for Progressive Change, she said.\nAs it turns out, Van Drew had reason to be wary of settings where constituents could openly confront him. After a candidate debate in February,\xa0Emily McGrath, 17, confronted Van Drew about getting a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association and receiving a $1,000 donation from the group in 2008. Van Drew had denied the latter a day earlier when speaking to McGrath’s high school class.\n“Senator, you lied,” McGrath said to him in an exchange caught on camera.\nIt is difficult to know what kind of general-election campaign Van Drew plans to run, let alone how he would vote as a member of the House Democratic Caucus. In lieu of an “issues” page detailing his views on a broad array of policies, Van Drew features an “about” page that is partly a biography and partly a kind of centrist manifesto, replete with paeans to the virtues of bipartisanship and “common sense.”\n“Moderation for the good of our nation and our children is a virtue,” he states. “It seems obvious to most of us, but unfortunately, extreme elements on both ends of the political spectrum are preventing that in Washington.”\nThe campaign website is not completely bereft of policy detail. On the homepage, Van Drew advertises his opposition to offshore oil drilling, fully funding the Children’s Health Insurance Program and protecting net neutrality.\xa0\nAnd Van Drew took steps earlier this year to inoculate himself from at least some progressive criticism. He withdrew his sponsorship from the amendment requiring parental notification for abortion and from legislation reinstating New Jersey’s death penalty for certain cases.\xa0\nThose gestures ― and the prospect of helping Democrats retake Congress ― may ultimately be enough for the district’s Democrats to back Van Drew.\nChris Perez, a Landisville-based forklift operator, college student and a self-described socialist, plans to vote for Van Drew as the least worst option.\n“The Democratic Party has deep systemic problems, but the Republican Party is a regressive party,”\xa0Perez said.\nHowever, Amie Maria Babischkin, a nurse active in Action New Jersey Together, said she currently plans to leave the congressional part of the ballot blank. Among other concerns, his vote against same-sex marriage legalization offends Babischkin personally, since she is a lesbian.\nVan Drew has also blocked her from his campaign Facebook page. She claims that Rep. LoBiondo, and failed Republican candidate Robert Turkavage both made themselves more available to her than Van Drew.\n“As of right now,\xa0Van Drew has five months to really win my vote,” Babisckin said. ”He doesn’t stand for a lot of the things that I stand for.”\n',

Videos on his\xa0YouTube page\xa0show that he marched in the\xa0“Unite the Right”\xa0white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last August and attended a free speech rally in Washington, D.C., last year that featured speakers including white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.\nAllsup is also aligned with Identity Evropa, an American group that has been labeled a white supremacist organization by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.\xa0\n\nHe has worked to advance his agenda\xa0“through the infiltration of the Republican Party rather than by the radical, revolutionary action favored by vanguardist groups on the extreme fringe,” according to the SPLC.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year Allsup told the white nationalist podcast “Fash the Nation”\xa0that a college student with “three or four fashy goy friends” could take over their College Republicans group and “move it to essentially being an alt-right club.” He also talked about forcing the “cucks” out of the GOP.\xa0\nHe told Identity Evropa’s podcast\xa0last week that he expects the infiltration of mainstream politics by white nationalists to take a little time, but he’s confident they can make significant inroads.\n“You have a seat at the table,” he said. “And that’s the most important thing, getting that seat at the table, and you can get that seat at the table by, yes, showing up, yes, by bringing people in.”\nAllsup told HuffPost he wasn’t interested in discussing the matter further.\nBut Keegan Hankes, senior research analyst at the SPLC, said, “Anytime that someone who holds extreme political positions has any foothold in mainstream politics, it’s a problem.”\nAllsup’s election to this kind of hyperlocal position is “disappointing but not surprising,” Hankes added. It has long been a strategy, he said, for white nationalists to seek power in uncontested elections.\xa0The SPLC counted\xa0eight white nationalists running for office this year, more than ever before.\xa0\n',

But all the late drama was ultimately for naught as Noem cruised to victory.\nFew substantive policy differences emerged between the two candidates during the campaign, and both pledged fealty to President Donald Trump’s agenda.\nNoem and her team went on offense by repeatedly calling Jackley a “government lawyer” tied to the state’s capital, Pierre. Jackley followed suit by casting the congresswoman as an establishment figure in Washington, which many GOP voters view in a negative light.\nJackley, 47, previously served as U.S. attorney for the district of South Dakota. He has extensive experience in prosecuting criminal and civil cases, including murder, assault, financial crimes and other felony cases.\nNoem,\xa046, previously served in the South Dakota House. She was first elected to her House seat,\xa0which encompasses the entire state,\xa0in 2010 and is a member of the chamber’s conservative Republican Study Committee. She also serves on the powerful Ways and Means committee, where she was involved in helping write last year’s bill\xa0that enacted sweeping tax cuts.\nNoem will square off in the Nov. 6 election against state Senate Democratic leader Billie Sutton, who begins the race as a pronounced underdog. The last Democrat to win the governor’s race was then-incumbent Dick Kneip in 1974. And Trump carried the deeply conservative state by nearly 30 percentage points in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'White House Aide Kelly Sadler Out After Mocking ‘Dying’ John McCain',
  'body': '\nKelly Sadler, the White House aide who reportedly mocked Sen. John McCain’s aggressive brain cancer, no longer works in the Trump administration, the White House said Tuesday.\n\n“Kelly Sadler is no longer employed within the Executive Office of the President,” White House spokesman Raj Shah stated.\nSadler could find a job elsewhere in the administration, White House counselor\xa0Kellyanne Conway\xa0said Wednesday on CNN’s “New Day.”\xa0Conway did not comment on why Sadler left the White House.\n“Kelly Sadler has been told there are administration jobs that fit with her skill set and her experience,” Conway said, “and that the rest is really her choice what she would like to do next.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN,\xa0citing three unnamed sources, first reported Tuesday that Sadler had left the White House. Sadler caused an outcry last month for reportedly dismissing McCain as “dying anyway” after the Arizona Republican announced his opposition to President Donald Trump’s nominee for CIA director, Gina Haspel.\xa0\nThe White House did not deny reports of Sadler’s comment at the time, and released a statement affirming respect for McCain, who was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War.\xa0Sadler’s remark may have been meant as a “joke,” but “fell flat,”\xa0a\xa0White House official told CNN.\nSadler’s heartless remark quickly\xa0drew a firestorm of criticism, including from McCain’s wife, Cindy.\n\n\n\nSadler later called McCain’s daughter Meghan, a host of ABC’s “The View,” to apologize, according to The Hill and CNN.\nMeghan McCain criticized Sadler’s comments\xa0as reflective of the Trump White House.\n“I don’t understand the kind of environment you’re working in where that would be acceptable and you could come into work the next day and still have a job,”\xa0she said, adding: “It’s not how you die. It’s how you live.”\nThe younger McCain later commented on the lack of a public acknowledgment from Sadler, who had promised her a public apology, she said. She noted that she “did not receive that,” and remarked that the White House was incapable of apology.\nJohn McCain was tortured in Vietnam and has long spoken against the U.S. government’s so-called enhanced interrogation tactics. He said he was dismayed that Haspel, who played an influential role in the CIA’s torture program after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, had\xa0dodged questions about the morality of the program\xa0during her Senate hearing.\n“Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing,” McCain said in a statement. “Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.”\nTrump has frequently attacked McCain, famously saying in 2015 that he prefers military heroes who “weren’t captured.”\nMcCain reportedly\xa0does not want Trump to attend his funeral, with friends asking the White House to send Vice President Mike Pence instead.\nThis article has been updated to include Kellyanne Conway’s comment.\nDoha Madani and Hayley Miller contributed reporting.\n',

 {'title': 'Not Many Eagles Fans Showed Up To Watch Donald Trump Sing The National Anthem',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump headlined a White House event on Tuesday that was originally intended to celebrate the Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles but didn’t feature any Eagles players and was attended by few Eagles fans. It was strange.\nUpon hearing that only a few Eagles players would show up to Tuesday’s event, Trump disinvited the team and\xa0rebranded the event as a “Celebration of America”\xa0during which he would “loudly and proudly” play the U.S. national anthem. In a statement, the White House said that “more than 1,000 Eagles fans” were supposed to show up to the original event and said the majority of Eagles players “decided to abandon their fans.”\nAnd so hundreds of individuals ― including many suit-clad people who appeared to be either members of the administration or Hill staffers ― stood on the South Lawn of the White House to hear the U.S. Marine Band and U.S. Army Chorus sing “God Bless America” and the U.S. national anthem and hear Trump speak for four minutes.\n“We love our country. We respect our flag. And we always proudly stand for the national anthem,” Trump told the crowd as members of the military served as his backdrop. “We always will stand for the national anthem.”\nIt was tough to tell what percentage of the crowd at the White House were Eagles fans. HuffPost asked several attendees if they were “Birds” fans ― a common nickname for the Eagles in the Philadelphia region (i.e., “go Birds”) ― and many responded quizzically. One person said they were a Browns fan, and another flashed a Dallas Cowboys phone background. Another said he wasn’t an Eagles fan but had appreciated what Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz had done for his fantasy league before Wentz’s season-ending ACL injury.\nThere were only a couple of faint Eagles chants from one group of young fans, and there were only a few members of the crowd wearing items indicating support for the Eagles. A sports reporter from Philadelphia said\xa0that he asked six attendees who the Eagles quarterback was at the Super Bowl and none of them knew the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the attendees were, indeed, members of Trump’s administration. A BBC reporter found a printed email on the ground that indicated all employees of the Executive Office of the President had been invited to the event.\nTrump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, implied that his decision to cancel on the Eagles was driven by Eagles players choosing to join former NFL player Colin Kaepernick in kneeling during the anthem to protest police brutality and white supremacy. But not a single Eagles player sat or kneeled during the national anthem last season. (Kaepernick knelt because a Green Beret suggested it, telling him that sitting would be disrespectful.)\xa0\nEagles safety Malcolm Jenkins has raised his fist during the anthem, and has been joined by other members of the team. Jenkins has spoken and written extensively about the injustices in the criminal justice system and its impact on communities of color. Jenkins issued a statement on Twitter before the event saying that Eagles players were being unfairly maligned.\n\n\n\n\nRich Schultz via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Simply google ‘How many Philadelphia Eagles knelt during the national anthem last season?’ and you find that the answer is zero,” Jenkins wrote. “A similar google search will show you how many great things the players on this team are doing and continue to do on a daily basis. Instead the decision was made to lie, and paint the picture that these players are anti-American, anti-flag and anti-military.”\nAttendees who didn’t work for Trump or on the Hill and were willing to chat, like Mike Fisher of Coopersburg, Pennsylvania, seemed to have gotten into the event though friends in the Trump administration. Fisher said he was bummed that there weren’t any Eagles players at the event. \n“I was definitely disappointed in last night’s news, you almost couldn’t believe it when it came across. Thought it was something from The Onion or something,” Fisher said. He called the lack of Eagles players at the event a “black eye on both sides” and said he wished the team and the Trump administration could have worked something out. \nThe crowd was supportive of Trump. One attendee clad in Eagles gear told reporters he thought Eagles management could have done a better job handling the situation. \nTrump called the event a “beautiful big celebration” that was “even bigger than we had anticipated,” although there was plenty of room on the South Lawn. He spoke about record unemployment numbers and said the country was doing great since his election.\n“If this wasn’t a political stunt by the Eagles franchise then they wouldn’t have committed to attend the event and then backed out,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon. \nThere were a few hiccups at the event. As Trump took the podium, a man heckled him and was quickly booed down.\n\n\n\nAnother attendee took a knee as the national anthem was played.\n\n\n\nChampionship visits to the White House are, for the most part, rote and uneventful affairs. They amount to little more than photo opportunities for presidents and political officials, a chance to seem as normal as any other sports fan. They offer D.C. political journalists an opportunity to pretend they’re sports reporters for a day. Rare is the time where they make news or elicit even remotely interesting comments, from politicians or athletes alike. But, as is the case with many presidential customs and traditions, Trump is breaking norms.\nAdditional reporting by Travis Waldron.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Disinvites Philadelphia Eagles From White House Super Bowl Celebration\n\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles Player Calls Out Fox News ‘Propaganda’ for Prayer Photo\n\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles Beat New England Patriots For First Super Bowl Win\n\n\n\n",

 {'title': 'Trump’s Claims Of Vast Power Could Be Heading Toward A Supreme Court Showdown',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― With the president and his lawyers claiming he is shielded from prosecution and simultaneously able to pardon himself for any federal crime, are there any checks on Donald Trump’s actions at all from the courts?\nAnd what happens if the courts rule against him on a matter he believes could threaten his presidency or even his liberty?\nAs Trump’s claims of overarching, even regal powers have grown more fervid in recent weeks, those questions have become increasingly worrisome to constitutional experts.\n“I don’t want to be an alarmist,” said Sarah Turberville with the Constitution Project, a group that has been urging Congress to pass a law protecting special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into Trump’s campaign. “But you could see this coming to a head.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“There certainly is such a worry,” said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School.\nThus far, Trump does not appear ready to directly challenge the power of the judiciary over him ― or at least his most talkative lawyer, former prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani, does not. When discussing a hypothetical subpoena by Mueller demanding that Trump appear before a grand jury, Giuliani said he would seek to quash it in court rather than just ignore it.\nMueller would surely go to court to enforce an ignored subpoena, Giuliani said in a recent interview with HuffPost. And the special counsel could have the president held in contempt if Trump’s lawyers lost that dispute. “We want to avoid the argument that the president is operating above the law,” Giuliani said.\nMultiple legal scholars contend that Trump and his team are already arguing that he is above the law. In a 20-page letter sent to Mueller in January, Trump’s lawyers claimed that the president, as head of the executive branch, has the authority to end any investigation undertaken within that branch as well as to render them moot using his pardon power.\nTrump has personally expanded on that message in a number of Twitter statements in recent days. “The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!” Trump wrote Monday, shortly after tweeting,\xa0“I have the absolute right to PARDON myself.”\nWhat’s more, given Trump’s demonstrated willingness to ignore established guidelines of behavior in public office, critics worry that he might easily trigger a constitutional crisis if courts started to rule against him.\nEarly last year, Trump said he had recently learned that conflict-of-interest laws did not apply to the president. Since then, he has continued to profit from his hotels and resorts, even from business clearly driven by his presidential position\xa0― despite promises during the campaign that he would separate himself from his private company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when Trump similarly realizes that nothing in the Constitution specifically requires him to accept a Supreme Court ruling he doesn’t like and that the high court’s authority largely flows from a 215-year-old precedent?\n“I don’t know what he would do,” said one former longtime Trump aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I just don’t know.”\nThe White House did not respond to HuffPost’s queries about the matter.\nIt was 1803 when Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the opinion giving the court the power it has today in the case of Marbury v. Madison. The Supreme Court ruled that James Madison, the secretary of state, acted illegally but that the law passed by Congress to remedy such situations was unconstitutional. In the process, the court established that it has the power to declare an act of another branch of government unconstitutional ― a precedent that the executive and legislative branches have honored ever since.\nTurberville has been relieved to see the Trump administration honoring adverse court rulings so far, but she said those decisions have all concerned his policies, such as banning visitors from predominantly Muslim nations. Trump could behave very differently, she said, if the ruling were to involve him personally ― upholding a subpoena requiring him to turn over business records, for example.\nPresident Richard Nixon complied with a Supreme Court ruling requiring him to turn over secretly recorded tapes of his White House conversations ― and ended up resigning just two weeks later.\n“The federal courts don’t have an army. They don’t have a police force to enforce their rulings,” Turberville said. Instead, she said, judges rely on people of good faith ― including officials in the other branches of government ― to honor established norms.\n“It is in the realm of possibility, hopefully not probability, that this president would seek to upend that. And then it would fall to Congress,” she said. “The only way to head off a constitutional crisis of this nature\xa0[would be] for Congress to impeach him.”\nTribe agreed that Congress could not tolerate such behavior by the president. “Even the Republicans in Congress who sit still as Trump gradually violates one constitutional norm after another may well rise up against outright defiance of a Supreme Court order,” he said.\nNorm Eisen, the top ethics lawyer in President Barack Obama’s White House and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that while he’s not as confident as he would like to be that Trump would honor a court order,\xa0he does not believe that Giuliani is ready to take on two centuries of Supreme Court precedent.\n“I don’t think he’s ready to re-litigate Marbury,”\xa0Eisen said.\nFor his part, Giuliani told HuffPost that he’s not.\nThe lawyer said Trump could not be prosecuted for any crime while he remained president, even in an extreme hypothetical case such as if he had shot James Comey last year rather than just firing the FBI director.\nBut had that actually happened, Trump would immediately have been impeached, Giuliani said ― and then added the country was lucky not to have had any truly violent presidents to test that theory.\n“Although, what if Aaron Burr had become president?” Giuliani joked. (Burr was Thomas Jefferson’s vice president in 1804 when he challenged Alexander Hamilton to a duel and killed him.)\nWhile Giuliani said that Trump has broad powers under the Constitution, he said the courts do as well. “I think ultimately we all agree that the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution,” Giuliani said.\n",

 {'title': 'EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Has Racked Up At Least 10 New Scandals In Just The Past Month',
  'body': "\nScott Pruitt faced at least 10 new scandals in just the past four weeks, stretching the Environmental Protection Agency administrator’s chaotic streak of corruption accusations into a third straight month.\nOn Tuesday, newly released internal emails showed Pruitt had ordered an aide to set up a call with the chairman of Chick-fil-A to discuss the administrator’s wife, Marlyn Pruitt, becoming a franchisee of the growing fast-food chain. Pruitt never completed the application, but the call raised concerns about the “misuse of public office,” Don Fox, who was head of the federal Office of Government Ethics during the Obama administration, told The Washington Post. \nTwo days in, it was still only the second-most bizarre revelation this week. \nOn Monday, testimony that two Democrats released in a letter to Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, showed Pruitt instructed Millan Hupp, a longtime aide, to try to buy “an old mattress” from the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Hupp told investigators that she wasn’t sure why Pruitt wanted the mattress and that, to her knowledge, it wasn’t for EPA business. \nYet the requests ― almost comical in their strangeness, raising new questions about his odd relationships with appointees ― served as distractions from a controversy that put Pruitt’s unabashedly close ties to an industry he regulates in stark relief. \nOn Saturday, The New York Times detailed how Pruitt sat courtside at a University of Kentucky basketball game in December as the guest of Joseph W. Craft III, a billionaire coal executive who aggressively lobbied to reverse Obama-era environmental rules. Pruitt has met with the Alliance Resource Partners chief executive, formerly a major donor to Pruitt’s election campaigns in his native Oklahoma, at least nine times since becoming EPA administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images\n\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt testifies during a Senate subcommittee hearing on the EPA budget on May 16.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, The Washington Post\xa0reported that Pruitt paid $3,230 in taxpayer money for personalized journals and pens, priced at $130 each, from the luxury Washington jewelry store Tiny Jewel Box. The revelation stoked criticism from Republicans who, despite supporting his radical deregulatory agenda, expressed dismay over his profligate spending. \nYet again, Pruitt’s cartoonishly unscrupulous behavior seemed to overshadow news highlighting what many see as the abuse of his position as the nation’s top environmental regulator. \nLast week, Pruitt named Steven D. Cook, a former chemical industry lawyer, as the new head of the EPA’s Superfund Task Force. LyondellBasell, the plastics and refining conglomerate where Cook spent more than 20 years as the in-house counsel, is linked to at least three dozen Superfund pollution sites. Cook replaced Albert Kelly, a former banker banned for life from the banking industry, who quit as the Superfund chief in May amid his own fresh corruption accusations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier last week, the EPA’s own science advisers rebuked Pruitt’s decision to gut Obama-era rules requiring automakers to reduce tailpipe emissions, arguing the agency ignored its own research in concluding that the regulations were too stringent. \nThe move came weeks after the EPA proposed new rules to eliminate regulations passed in the wake of the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas, that killed 15 people in 2013. In a news release, the agency boasted that the new proposal would “save $88 million in regulatory costs.” \nAmid a steady stream of embarrassing new details about Pruitt’s administration, the agency has become less transparent. Last month, the EPA barred reporters from entering a heavily publicized summit on toxic water contaminants. An Associated Press reporter was grabbed and shoved by a security guard.\n\nTwo days in, it was still only the second-most bizarre revelation this week.\n\nYet Pruitt has continued to grant interviews to media outlets staffed by right-wing political operatives. \nLast week, Pruitt sat down with Boris Epsteyn, the former Trump White House official who now hosts propagandistic segments aired on Sinclair Broadcast Group stations. The administrator endured softball questions from the conservative Washington Free Beacon. Meanwhile, the EPA has repeatedly fed angles to The Daily Caller, whose EPA reporter had\xa0previously worked\xa0for the billionaire Koch brothers’ political network and its think tanks. Media Matters for America, the liberal watchdog group, said last month, “The Daily Caller and the Washington Free Beacon are serving as de facto press offices for the EPA.”\nPruitt also faced fresh criticism over past political decisions with no connection to his current job at the EPA. Last month, Pruitt took heat from women’s rights advocates after HuffPost reported on anti-abortion legislation he twice proposed as an Oklahoma state senator to give men “property rights” over unborn fetuses. \nIt’s unclear how much the new scandals ― if that word hasn’t completely lost its meaning ― add to the pressure Pruitt is facing to resign. The avalanche of ethics issues began in March, when ABC News reported that Pruitt rented a Capitol Hill townhouse owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist with business before the EPA for just $50 a night. By early April, Pruitt faced at least 23 ethical issues. By last month, he was the subject of at least a dozen formal probes from the Government Accountability Office, the White House, the EPA inspector general and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \nNeither the EPA nor the White House responded to requests for comment on Tuesday.\xa0\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Least 23 Ethical Issues Are Dogging EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Pruitt Asked Aide To Buy Used Trump Mattress, Book Flights On Personal Time\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Pruitt Prefers Fancy Silver Fountain Pens At $130 A Pop\n\n\n\n\n\nDo You Know What’s Going On With Scott Pruitt’s Longtime Aides?\n\n\n\n",

 {'title': 'Supreme Court Throws Out Immigrant Teen Abortion Ruling',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out a lower court ruling that let a pregnant undocumented immigrant minor held in federal immigration custody to obtain an abortion last year at age 17 over the objections of President Donald Trump’s administration.\nThe action by the justices provided a legal victory to Trump’s administration even though the teenager already has had the abortion because it eliminated a precedent at the federal appeals court level that could have applied in similar circumstances in which detained minors sought abortions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the unsigned opinion with no dissents, the justices threw out the appeals court decision on the grounds that the dispute became moot once the unnamed teenager had the abortion.\nThe justices, however, declined to take up the administration’s request for disciplinary action against the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who represented the girl, who underwent an abortion in Texas last October. The administration had accused the ACLU lawyers of misleading the Justice Department over when she would have the abortion.\nThe court also allowed litigation to continue in lower courts concerning other detained immigrants in detention in a similar situation.\nThe high court said that it takes misconduct allegations against lawyers seriously but said “not all communication breakdowns constitute misconduct.”\nThe ACLU, which has filed a range of lawsuits against the administration, sued in Washington in October, seeking a decision on obtaining abortions that would be binding in any future cases that arise.\nA 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalized abortion nationwide. One of the issues raised by the case is whether undocumented immigrant women have the same right to an abortion as American citizens and legal residents.\nThe girl at the center of the legal fight had an abortion on Oct. 25, the day after a U.S. appeals court ruled against the Trump administration’s objections.\nThe Justice Department has said it was preparing to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court when it learned she had already had the abortion early that morning.\nWhile the case was pending at the Supreme Court, litigation continued in lower courts.\nOn March 30, a federal judge in Washington issued an injunction that prevents the administration from impeding access to abortion by detained immigrant minors. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan also certified a class action of similar minors to challenge the administration’s policy.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)\n',

And then, this week, there’s the thing\xa0with\xa0Pruitt asking his director of scheduling, Millan Hupp, to get him a used Trump hotel mattress. She resigned this week.\nIn fact, a lot of the weird stuff surrounding Pruitt seems to involve his aides. Samantha Dravis, senior counsel and associate administrator in the EPA’s Office of Policy, resigned suddenly in April despite enjoying a warm relationship with her boss. Sources described her to The Hill as Pruitt’s “best friend” and someone he had dinner with “several times every week.” While her exit was not tied to the administrator’s whirlwind of ethics scandals, she did collect a salary despite failing to “attend work or perform her duties for much if not all of the months of November 2017 - January 2018,” according to a letter from Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.). \nSarah Greenwalt, another senior adviser who came to the EPA with Pruitt from Oklahoma, became a flashpoint in the administrator’s firestorm of scandals over a pay rise she received. Pruitt asked to bump her salary from $107,435 to $164,200, a 53 percent increase.\xa0She, too, resigned this week.\xa0\nNearly every EPA employee we’ve spoken with suggests there’s more here than has been revealed, but thus far details have been scarce.

  'body': "\nOregon Sen. Jeff Merkley (D) was barred from entering an immigration detention center in Texas and had the police called on him during his visit, according to a live video of the encounter posted to Facebook on Sunday evening.\nMerkley traveled to the facility in Brownsville, called Casa Padre, to criticize a recent Trump administration policy that will likely result in more undocumented immigrant children being separated from their parents. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last month that the Justice Department would dramatically increase prosecutions of families who cross the U.S. border illegally, even if children would be removed from their parents during the process.\nIn the video, Merkley said he was going to try to tour the facility after his staff attempted to set up a meeting to do so last week. He can be seen walking up to the building, which he says is a former Walmart with blacked-out windows and locked doors, where he is told that he can’t come in, but that her supervisor would come meet the senator outside.\nBefore the manager ventured out, however, police arrived. The supervisor later tells Merkley he can’t give the lawmaker a statement and refers him to an outside phone number.\n\n\n\n“The reason why I came is this new policy that the attorney general has in place of families that are waiting for the adjudication of their application for asylum in the U.S., and the children are being separated,” Merkley tells police officers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“We usually told ahead of time if anybody is going to come and visit us,” the facility’s supervisor replied, before repeating that he won’t tell the lawmaker anything.\nMerkley said during the livestream that the center “may currently be housing hundreds of refugee children who have been separated from their parents.” No member of Congress has visited the facility, Merkley noted, which is being run by a nonprofit group called Southwest Key Programs.\nSessions has roundly defended his agency’s new policy, saying it would deter illegal border crossings into the United States. Democrats, on the other hand, have roundly slammed the changes, although President Donald Trump blamed the party for the family separations last week even though it was his own administration that instituted the move.\n“If you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law,” Sessions said at a conference in Arizona last month regarding the enforcement. “If you don’t like that, then don’t smuggle children over our border.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats have called on the Justice Department to end the new prosecutions.

 {'title': 'The California Primaries Are A Glorious Mess. They Could Determine Who Wins The House.',
  'body': "\nIn the past week, two major political groups have spent $100,000 on digital ads and phone banks promoting congressional candidate John Gabbard, who is running for the seat held by Republican U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in California’s 48th District.\nThe ads, captured by Facebook’s political ad archive, are unremarkable in their political rhetoric. They boast of Gabbard’s military experience. They say he’ll “go to Washington to fight for taxpayers… not the special interests” and that he “believes we need term limits for Congress because it’s time to drain the swamp.” \nWhat’s remarkable is who is paying for the ads boosting Gabbard, a little-known Republican: the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a super PAC backed by the liberal Service Employees International Union. \nWelcome to the California primaries, where a jungle primary is leading to previously unknown levels of gamesmanship, and where control of the U.S. House of Representatives might hang in the balance. The jungle primary means the top two vote-getters in each of the state’s 53 congressional districts, including 10 considered up for grabs, will advance to the general election in November ― regardless of party.\nThe unique system ― only Washington state and Louisiana have something similar ― worries Democrats, who fear they could fail to reach the general election in some districts. And that could hamstring their hopes to win back the House in November. \nThat’s led to a wave of spending ― at least $8 million from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Priorities USA, Patriot Majority and House Majority PAC ― and some unusual tactics.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“The top-two jungle primary revolutionized political campaigns,” said Dave Jacobson, a veteran Democratic consultant in California. “You have to think outside the box to capitalize on the system to help your candidate.” \n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nDemocrats Are Blaming A Big-Spending Candidate For A Potential Disaster In California\n\n\n\nMany Democrats in California and Washington, D.C., think the threat of their party being locked out of the general election has been overhyped, considering how Democrats have exceeded turnout expectations in election after election during Donald Trump’s presidency. But the spending shows how dire leading Democratic strategists think the consequences could be.\xa0\n“It’s a threat to be taken seriously,” said Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster who has done work in California in the past. “At the same time, a big lesson from 2017 and 2018 is that Democratic turnout is up. And that could be a saving grace.”\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have spent money turning out their base in hopes of generating a Democratic lockout. But for the most part, they’re content to sit back and watch the finger-pointing. \xa0\n“The DCCC and Nancy Pelosi’s super PAC are lighting money on fire right now in hopes they can avert a catastrophe in their most-focused-on area of the country,” said NRCC spokesman Jesse Hunt. “Republicans are in an even stronger position today after Democratic candidates aired each other’s personal dirty laundry and battled over who is most progressive.”\nThe threat of a lockout is real in three districts targeted by Democrats: the 48th District, held by Rohrabacher; the 49th District, where GOP Rep. Darrell Issa is retiring; and the 39th District, where GOP Rep. Ed Royce is retiring. All three districts are centered in the Southern California suburbs in Orange and San Diego counties, former GOP strongholds where Trump cratered in 2016. \xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 48th District, Democrats are boosting Gabbard to draw votes away from Scott Baugh, a former Orange County GOP chairman, with many of the ads telling voters he is “better than Baugh.” Democrats fear Baugh, a more traditional Republican than the Russia-friendly Rohrabacher, could win enough votes to finish second behind the incumbent.\nAnother layer to Democratic problems is the battle between businessman Harley Rouda and stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead. While Keirstead was the early favorite and won the endorsement of the California Democratic Party, the DCCC endorsed Rouda after a whistleblower complaint surfaced alleging Keirstead once punched a female student, among other misconduct. Keirstead denies the allegations.\nIn the 49th, the DCCC aired television ads attacking Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, a more moderate Republican, criticizing him for supporting cap-and-trade and for backing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown’s budget.\xa0\n\nRecent polling shows the ads have successfully deflated support for Chavez, with the GOP coalescing behind state tax board member Diane Harkey.

  'body': "\nWASHINGTON\xa0― Candidate Donald Trump bragged that he could shoot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose any support, and now President Donald Trump’s lawyer says Trump could shoot the FBI director in the Oval Office and still not be prosecuted for it.\n“In no case can he be subpoenaed or indicted,” Rudy Giuliani told HuffPost Sunday, claiming a president’s constitutional powers are that broad. “I don’t know how you can indict while he’s in office. No matter what it is.”\nGiuliani said impeachment was the initial remedy for a president’s illegal behavior\xa0― even in the extreme hypothetical case of Trump having shot former FBI Director James Comey to end the Russia investigation rather than just firing him.\n“If he shot James Comey, he’d be impeached the next day,” Giuliani said. “Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him.”\nNorm Eisen, the White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the silliness of Giuliani’s claim illustrates how mistaken Trump’s lawyers are about presidential power.\n“A president could not be prosecuted for murder? Really?” he said. “It is one of many absurd positions that follow from their argument. It is self-evidently wrong.”\nEisen and other legal scholars have concluded that the constitution offers no blanket protection for a president from criminal prosecution. “The foundation of America is that no person is above the law,” he said. “A president can under extreme circumstances be indicted, but we’re facing extreme circumstances.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA president could not be prosecuted for murder? Really? It is one of many absurd positions that follow from their argument. It is self-evidently wrong.\nNorm Eisen, former White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama\n\nGiuliani’s comments came a day after The New York Times revealed that Trump’s lawyers in January made their case to special counsel Robert Mueller that Trump could not possibly have obstructed justice because he has the ability to shut down any investigation at any time.\n“He could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired,” Jay Sekulow and John Dowd wrote in a 20-page letter. Dowd has since left Trump’s legal team, replaced by Giuliani.\nThe letter also admits that Trump “dictated” a statement that was then released by his son, Donald Trump Jr., regarding a meeting held at Trump Tower in June 2016 between top Trump campaign officials and Russians with links to that country’s spy agencies.\nThat meeting was scheduled after the Russians said they had damaging information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that would be of use to the Trump campaign. The Trump-dictated statement falsely claimed the meeting was primarily about the adoption of Russian children by American families\xa0― the same topic that Trump claimed had been the substance of a conversation he had had with Russian leader Vladimir Putin the previous evening in Germany.\n\n\n\n\nCarlos Barria / Reuters\n\n\nTrump shakes hands with\xa0Russian President Vladimir Putin during the their bilateral meeting at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded during the 2016 campaign that not only was Russia interfering in the U.S. election, but was actively trying to help Trump win.\nBoth Sekulow and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders claimed, falsely, that Trump had not dictated the statement, but had merely offered his son suggestions. Sanders on Sunday referred questions about the matter to Trump’s outside legal team.\nGiuliani said Sekulow was misinformed about the Trump Tower meeting, which in any case was not that significant. “In this investigation, the crimes are really silly,” he said, arguing that the firing of Comey last year could not be construed as obstruction of justice because Trump had the right to fire him at any time and for any reason. “This is pure harassment, engineered by the Democrats.”\nComey had been leading the FBI probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence until his dismissal, which led to the appointment of Mueller to take it over. Within two days of the firing, Trump told both NBC News and Russian officials visiting him in the Oval Office that he had done it because of the investigation.\nEisen said Giuliani’s assertion, taken to its logical conclusion, would mean that a mob boss under investigation by the FBI could give Trump a bribe to fire the FBI director, Trump could explain on television that he had done so “because of this Mafia thing,” and then not face criminal charges.\n“Well, of course it would be appropriate to initiate a prosecution,” he said. “I think the legally correct answer is, as usual, the opposite of Giuliani’s answer.”\nGiuliani, once the mayor of New York City and prior to that the U.S. attorney there, took charge of Trump’s outside legal team in April, saying then that he planned to wrap the whole thing up within a few weeks. Now he said he is not sure when it will end because Mueller is taking too long and not turning over material to Giuliani\xa0― such as a report of what was learned from an FBI informant who made contact with several members of the Trump campaign with links to Russia.\nGiuliani said he has so far met with Trump about 10 times and spoken to him on the phone another 40 or so times, totaling at least 75 hours of conversation. “I’m not billing by the hour, otherwise I could tell you exactly,” he joked about the case he has taken on for free.\nMueller’s investigation has so far resulted in the guilty pleas of five people, including three former Trump campaign staffers, and the indictment of 14 other people and three companies. That total includes 13 Russians, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Internet Research Agency, a “troll farm” that was used to create and disseminate propaganda to help Trump win.\nA related investigation by Giuliani’s former U.S. attorney’s office is examining the dealings of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. A former business partner has agreed to cooperate in that probe and plead to New York state charges.\n",

 {'title': 'Bill Clinton Suggests Trump Would Already Face Impeachment If He Were A Democrat',
  'body': '\nFormer President Bill Clinton suggested an impeachment process for President Donald Trump would have been set in motion by now if he were a Democrat.\nIn an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning,” Clinton discussed special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as the media’s treatment of Trump.\n“I think [news outlets] have tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts,” Clinton said. “I think if the roles were reversed ― now, this is me just talking, but it’s based on my experience ― I think if it were a Democratic president, and these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe impeachment hearings would have begun already.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton, a Democrat, faced a GOP-controlled Congress at the time of his impeachment. Trump, in contrast, deals with a Congress in which his fellow Republicans hold the majorities in both of its chambers.\nClinton was impeached in late 1998 by simple majority votes in the House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Senate fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict him and oust him from office in February 1999 following roughly a month-long trial.\nTrump has seemingly adopted several of the techniques Clinton and his allies used to undercut the impeachment proceeding against him, as reported by The New York Times last week.\xa0\nTrump has repeatedly referred to Mueller’s probe, which includes looking at the president’s potential obstruction of justice, as a partisan “witch hunt.” Clinton and his backers similarly discredited the impeachment push against him.\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have attempted to start the process of impeaching Trump, though the party’s leadership has pushed back against the efforts.\n“Unless you have bipartisan consensus, impeachment is a divisive issue in the country,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said\xa0last month. “Many people would think it’s being done for political reasons.”\nRepublicans are seeking to gain a political advantage from the talk of impeachment, warning that Democrats will start such proceedings against Trump if the party wins a House majority in November’s elections.\n',

  'body': "\nThe Facebook page for Budgeting California\xa0had only five visible posts about innocuous issues like gas prices, property taxes and a personal finance workshop hosted by the Los Angeles Rams before Tuesday ― when California holds its first-round primary elections. But the page had purchased dozens of ads\xa0that used conservative messaging to oppose Shawn Nelson and Bob Huff,\xa0two Republicans running in the state’s 39th Congressional District. On Election Day, a public post appeared attacking Nelson.\nThe creators of Budgeting California are two super PACs affiliated with the Democratic Party.\nThis is not a new practice. Campaigns and PACs on both sides of the partisan divide have been setting up Facebook pages and websites under names not their own for at least the past 10 years. What’s changed is that it has become much easier to find these pages and identify who is behind them since Facebook set up a database on May 24 to disclose political ads running on its platform.\n\n\n\n\nfacebook.com / budgeting california\n\n\nA Facebook ad run by the page Budgeting California is actually paid for by House Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, many of the Facebook ads run by campaigns and PACs could be viewed only by the specific users targeted by the advertisers. Different segments of the voting population saw different ads, without knowing what other people could see.\xa0And the Facebook pages running the ads often had names that were not immediately identifiable with any political party, in an effort to influence audiences who would otherwise discount the source.\nThat is still the case with pages like Budgeting California, Orange County Crooks and SoCal Priorities. Budgeting California is run by House Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action, two major Democratic players. The same two groups are behind Orange County Crooks, a page that bought ads against Scott Baugh, a Republican running in California’s 48th Congressional District. The SoCal Priorities page is run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and aims to divert Republican votes away from Baugh and toward rival Republican John Gabbard.\nThe Democratic Party is particularly interested in flipping the House seats in California’s 39th and 48th districts this year.\xa0Because of California’s “jungle” primary system ― in which the two top vote-getters,\xa0regardless of party, advance to the general election ― parties can’t wait until the general election to take on the other side.\n“Campaigns and political organizations have long created branded websites that share specific information with voters,” said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action. “These are locally focused pages for sharing articles and information from reputable news outlets and clearly labeled political sites that are of interest to voters in a specific region.”\n\n\n\n\nfacebook.com / socal priorities\n\n\nSoCal Priorities is a\xa0Facebook page run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesmen for House Majority PAC and Senate Majority PAC, another Democratic Party organization, also told HuffPost that they run Facebook ads to aim state- or race-specific messaging at a local audience.\nDemocrats aren’t the only ones using such ads to reach voters in California. American Future Fund, a conservative nonprofit that does not disclose its donors, runs two pages called California Voter Update and California Voter Action. California Voter Update’s ads promote Baugh; Young Kim, a Republican running in the 39th District;\xa0and Diane Harkey, a Republican running in the 49th District. California Voter Action runs ads attacking Kristin Gaspar, a Republican running against Harkey. (Republicans are trying to hold onto the 49th District seat after its longtime GOP representative decided not to run for re-election.)\nIt turns out that American Future Fund is itself another layer obscuring the real advertiser here. The actual writer of the checks is Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), according to\xa0Politico.\n\n\n\n\nfacebook.com / california voter update\n\n\nCalifornia Voter Update is a Facebook page run by the conservative nonprofit American Future Fund.\n\n\n\nSome groups choose not to obscure their affiliation. Patriot Majority USA, a Democratic Party-affiliated nonprofit group that doesn’t disclose its donors, advertises through Facebook pages that explicitly state the partisan purpose of the ads. The group’s get-out-the-vote pages ― Your Voting Record Is Public, Vote For A Better California and Send DC A Message on June 5th ― have all aimed to convince those voters likely to support Democratic candidates to head to the polls on Tuesday. The targeting information revealed by Facebook’s new disclosure system shows that the get-out-the-vote ads target young women, a very favorable constituency for Democrats.\n\n\n\n\nfacebook.com / your voting record is public\n\n\nYour Voting Record Is Public is a Facebook page run by Patriot Majority USA.\n\n\n\nThe head of Patriot Majority USA offered another reason for why those Facebook pages aren’t simply named for the super PAC.\n“We believe that the page name is valuable real estate in the way that Facebook advertisements are served,” said Craig Varoga. “It is the very first thing that the user sees before the actual advertising copy and it is a best practice to use that real estate with content that will drive the message we’re looking to spread.”\nAlthough California’s primary process has drawn a lot of party attention this year, political organizations are using localized pages in other states as well. Senate Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action run local pages to support the re-election campaigns of Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.). House Majority PAC has three\xa0different\xa0pages\xa0on Facebook targeting negative ads at Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.). Similar local pages with names different from their owners’ are weighing in on gubernatorial races in Illinois, Nevada and Vermont. In one case, a Republican Senate candidate in Virginia, E.W. Jackson, purchased ads through the Facebook page for Official Wire, a seemingly defunct conservative news site. \nThese semi-hidden local pages and discreet advertising practices will continue trying to influence voters through the November general election. Now, it’s possible to keep track of them.\n",

 {'title': '‘Missing’ Melania Trump Briefly Surfaces To Attend White House Event',
  'body': '\nAlmost a month after vanishing from public view, first lady Melania Trump appeared Monday at a White House reception honoring Gold Star families. Her reemergence comes after weeks of rampant speculation about where she’s been since undergoing surgery in mid-May.\xa0\nMonday’s event was not open to the press but a blurry video shared by a Daily Caller reporter appeared to show the president and the first lady walking into the reception.\n\n\n\nThe first lady herself tweeted photographs showing her in the audience.\n“Thank you to the Gold Star families that joined us in celebration & remembrance,” Trump wrote in the tweet.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe last time the first lady participated in a public event was May 10, when she accompanied the president to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to welcome home three American hostages released by North Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital four days later to undergo surgery for a benign kidney condition. She was hospitalized for five days following the procedure.\nMedical experts suggested at the time that the extended hospital stay was atypical for the procedure Trump underwent.\n“It may be just out of an abundance of caution and privacy,” Dr. Mohamad Allaf, vice chairman of urology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told CNN. “Certainly, staying a little longer may imply that this is a little bit more of a complex situation.”\nUntil Monday,\xa0the first lady had been out of the public eye for 25 consecutive days. “It is an unusual stretch for one of the most visible women in the world and, according to historians, it is the longest break anyone has taken from the role in modern memory,” reported The New York Times.\nJokes, rumors and conspiracy theories had abounded in the media and online about the first lady’s possible whereabouts. She was cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, some mused. Comedian Conan O’Brien joked last week\xa0that she was hiking the Appalachian Trail with him. “Missing Melania” posters were plastered around New York City with the words: “Have you seen this woman?”\xa0\n\n\n\nA tweet posted on the first lady’s account last week tried to quell some of the rumor-mongering.\n“I see the media is working overtime speculating where I am & what I’m doing,” the tweet said. “Rest assured, I’m here\xa0[at the White House with] my family, feeling great & working hard on behalf of children & the American people!”\xa0\nAccording to CNN, President Trump joked about his wife’s prolonged absence during the Gold Star reception. He said the media had speculated that the first lady may have left him, before pointing out that she was sitting in the front row.\nCNN described the joke as “playful, but a bit awkward” given that the event was to honor military families who’d lost relatives at war.\nThe White House said over the weekend that the first lady will not be traveling with her husband to the G7 meeting in Quebec this week or to Singapore for the June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\xa0\nStephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, told the Times on Monday that it was “pretty typical” for people to avoid travel after undergoing medical procedures.\n“Mrs. Trump has always been a strong and independent woman who puts her family, and certainly her health, above all else, and that won’t change over a rabid press corps,” Grisham said. “She’s confident in what she is doing and in her role, and knows the rest is just speculation and nonsense.”\n',

These included communications with Russian national Ivan Timofeev, director at the Russian International Affairs Council, and with Joseph Mifsud, a Maltese professor who’d told Papadapoulos that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, reported The New York Times.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller indicated late last month that he was ready to proceed with Papadopoulos’ sentencing. The former campaign aide faces a maximum sentence of five years behind bars. Prosecutors have agreed, however, to seek a lower sentence of zero to six months in return for his cooperation with the investigation.\xa0\nOn Monday, Papadopoulos’ wife said her husband had “never had any interactions with Russians” and had not actively sought out damaging information about Clinton.\xa0\n“One of the reasons I am here tonight... is to set the record straight about George,” she told Carlson.\nShe conceded that Papadopoulos had met with the Maltese professor but said their interaction had merely been a “gossip conversation” about Clinton’s emails.\n″[He] never colluded with the Russians. He didn’t do anything with Russia,” she said of her husband.\n\n\n\nEarlier Monday, Trump boasted in a tweet that he had an “absolute right” to pardon himself in the Russia probe,\xa0though noting he would have no reason to do so since he’s “done nothing wrong.”\nWhile the last three U.S. presidents hadn’t issued any pardons at this point in their presidency,\xa0Trump has shown a penchant for issuing pardons, particularly for his political friends.\xa0Since taking office, he’s already pardoned five people, including\xa0Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative provocateur who pleaded guilty in 2014 of violating federal campaign finance laws, and controversial former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was\xa0convicted of criminal contempt\xa0last year for violating a federal judge’s order barring him and his office from detaining individuals solely based on suspicions about their immigration status.\n',

Maybe he just got it wrong, like I got a few things wrong at the beginning of the investigation.”\n“That’s a lot of mistakes,” Cuomo fired back.\nSanders dodged questions about the statement on Monday after the Times’ story and referred journalists’ questions to Trump’s outside legal team.\nThe CNN host later played a mashup of clips showing Sekulow and Sanders denying the dictation several times last year.\n“Somebody is lying,” Cuomo said. “It’s not the kind of information that you would get wrong, that you wouldn’t be privy to, that would change. Assuming that the president would’ve told them the truth about what was happening, somebody is lying about this, Rudy, and I don’t understand why.”\n“I don’t think anybody’s lying, I think a mistake was made,” Giuliani said. “The most important thing is there was no testimony under oath to that effect and then when a written statement was put in, it was completely accurate.”\nWatch the full video below.\n\n',

On Tuesday, the state’s GOP voters will decide on who will take up that task.\xa0\nTester, a self-assured farmer, has consistently opposed the president’s nominees\xa0even as he runs for re-election in a state Trump won by 20 percentage points. He put himself squarely in Trump’s sights with the leading role he played earlier this year in derailing the president’s nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to be veterans’ affairs secretary.\xa0\nTrump has declared Tester “should lose,” and four Republicans are vying to end his Senate career after two terms.\xa0\n\n\n\nState Auditor Matt Rosendale is the frontrunner, with backing from a slew of big national names ― the economic conservatives at the Club for Growth have spent heavily on his behalf, and he boasts endorsements from GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\nBut some local Republicans back either former judge Russ Fagg, whose supporters include former governor and Republican National Committee chairman Marc Racicot and former Rep. Denny Rehberg, who lost to Tester in 2012. And businessman and veteran Troy Downing has the backing of Lola Zinke, the wife of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\xa0\nThe once-quiet race has exploded with negativity in recent weeks. The Club for Growth has attacked both Fagg\xa0and Downing with digital ads, hitting Fagg’s record as a judge and Downing’s business record. Fagg has slammed Rosendale for his opposition to the death penalty, and a mysterious outside group that won’t have to reveal its donors until after the election is blasting\xa0“Maryland Matt,” who was born in Baltimore, as a carpetbagger.\n\nIf Rosendale prevails in the primary,\xa0expect the Tester campaign to pick up this line of attack and run with it. The Montana Democratic Party has already slammed Rosendale as a “phony rancher.” Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock successfully used a similar line of attack against now-Rep. Greg Gianforte in their 2016 race, dubbing him “Jersey Gianforte.” Rosendale,\xa0though, has pointed to Gianforte’s win in a closely watched 2017 special House race as evidence he can brush aside the attacks.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Contenders Back Iowa Candidate\xa0\n\n\n\n\nReuters Photographer / Reuters\n\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and New York Sen.

Rod Blum, who won a shocking victory in 2014 and hung on in 2016 as the district went from backing President Barack Obama with 56 percent of the vote in 2012 to picking Trump by a 3-point margin over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton four years later.\xa0\nA Warren Protege In A Republican Bastion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images\n\n\nKatie Porter, a former law student of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is trying to prove her populist politics can thrive in a wealthy area.\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s 45th Congressional District has seen a less wacky race than some of its neighboring seats in Southern California, and there’s no chance of a Democratic lock-out here. But the race is worth watching to see if Katie Porter, a former law student and protege of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, can earn the right to face GOP Rep. Mimi Walters in November.\xa0\nPorter is one of four Democrats in the race, but her chief rival is Dave Min, a former congressional aide who has the endorsement of the state’s Democratic Party. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is running digital ads attacking Min for opposing “Medicare for All” and for taking money from a political action committee affiliated with the New Democrats, a centrist group of congressional Democrats.\xa0\nIf Porter does win,\xa0the general election will serve as a test of how well a Warren-style populist can do in a wealthy enclave ― the 45th has the 13th highest median income of any district in the country. The district, centered around the city of Irvine, was a center of Southern California Republicanism until Clinton flipped it in 2016. The race is likely to be a toss-up, regardless of which Democrat wins a chance to challenge Walters.\xa0\nCan Kristi Noem Break The House GOP’s Losing Streak?\n\nHouse Republicans haven’t done well in competitive primaries for higher office this election cycle. Businessman Mike Braun romped over Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita in the Indiana Senate primary. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (with some assistance from Democrats) topped Rep. Evan Jenkins in the battle for West Virginia’s GOP Senate nomination. And in Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador failed to secure the party’s nomination for governor.\xa0\nSouth Dakota Rep. Kristi Noem hopes to break the pattern by defeating Attorney General Marty Jackley in the state’s Republican gubernatorial primary. A recent poll found the two essentially tied.\xa0\nJackley has been attacking Noem for her time in Washington ― the same poll found just 15 percent of GOP primary voters approved of how Washington works, compared to 71 percent who approved of state government.\xa0\n“South Dakotans deserve a governor they can be proud of, not a D.C. politician who breaks their promises and will say anything to get elected,” a male narrator says in one of Jackley’s ads.\nNoem has fired back with her own ads featuring a sexual harassment victim alleging Jackley failed to help her\xa0when the South Dakota Department of Criminal Investigation retaliated after she reported her complaint.\n“You can’t be above the law just because you’re the one who enforces it,” the woman says in the ad.\xa0\nThe winner of the race is likely to become governor in heavily Republican South Dakota.\xa0\nCan A Republican Who Broke With Trump Survive In Alabama?\xa0\n\n\n\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images\n\n\nAlabama Rep. Martha Roby broke with then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump after the release late in the 2016 campaign of the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women.\n\n\n\nAlabama GOP Rep. Martha Roby wasn’t alone among Republicans when she decided to drop her endorsement of then-nominee Trump in early October of 2016, after the disclosure of the Access Holllywood tape featuring him bragging about sexually assaulting women. But she then found herself in surprise political peril.\nOn Election Day, she won re-election with just shy of 49 percent of the vote, as her Democratic rival captured close to 41 percent and a write-in candidate siphoned off almost 11 percent. Clearly, some of her constituents in the 2nd Congressional District abandoned her for abandoning Trump.\xa0\xa0\nRoby has since made peace with the president,\xa0but three challengers hope to springboard off her initial defection and force her into a July runoff. The highest-profile is Bobby Bright, a former Montgomery mayor who held the seat from 2009 to 2011 as a Democrat and has since switched parties.\nAnother challenger, Rich Hobson, is a longtime aide to Roy Moore, whose Senate candidacy ended in disaster for Republicans last December after allegations surfaced that he had accosted teenage girls decades ago as a young man.\xa0\nRoby needs to win more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff in the district, which includes Montgomery and southeastern Alabama.\xa0\n",

  'body': "\nIn her campaign for Congress in Alabama, Adia McClellan Winfrey has repeatedly referred to herself as a clinical psychologist. On Twitter, in interviews, on her campaign website, on her LinkedIn page and in speeches in front of Democratic Party groups, she has spoken of her experience as a clinical psychologist (and often as a “pioneering psychologist”) and held it up as a key reason that voters in Alabama’s 3rd Congressional District should vote for her in the Democratic primary Tuesday.\nBut Winfrey has never been licensed as a psychologist in any state that she’s lived in, including Wisconsin, Ohio, Georgia and Alabama. In each of those states, a person representing themselves to the public as a psychologist must be licensed by a state board. If they aren’t licensed, they are violating the law.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nWinfrey received a doctorate in psychology in 2008 from Wright State University in Ohio. HuffPost confirmed her doctorate through a third-party service authorized by Wright State to verify the education of its graduates.\xa0\nWinfrey, who refers to herself as Dr. Dia, created a curriculum that involves something she calls hip-hop therapy. Winfrey would visit troubled youth in group homes and essentially offered group therapy along with hip-hop music to help the youth open up.\nIn a phone conversation, Winfrey confirmed that she has never been licensed as a psychologist in any state that she’s lived and worked in since attaining her degree.\n“I’ve never been a licensed psychologist. I did complete the hours required for licensure ― but right when I was going to be studying for licensure exam, that’s when my curriculum took off.”\nWinfrey said colleagues told her that the opportunity to market her curriculum was \xa0“once in a lifetime.”\nAfter being told that by holding herself out as a psychologist violates state law in Georgia and Alabama, Winfrey said she was stunned to learn that that referring to herself as a psychologist and offering her hip-hop therapy without licensure was against the law. “I have been referring to myself as a clinical psychologist for nearly 10 years but have never told anyone that I am licensed and have never diagnosed anyone.”\nIn response to a question about what the difference was in her mind between what she was doing and licensed psychology, Winfrey said, “The biggest difference is how I’m paid. If I was licensed, I would be able to bill through Medicaid or through various insurance companies.”\nWinfrey said she would bill organizations that wanted to offer her curriculum (including hip-hop therapy) for her standard fee and it would be up to those organizations to seek funds, whether it was through grants or some other means, to pay for her fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA campaign spokeswoman, when asked about the licensing, told HuffPost via text. “She earned her Doctorate of Clinical Psychology degree in 2008 and has worked with youth and trained professionals in 26 states.\xa0Her curriculum she developed is currently being used in Australia, Canada, throughout London and Botswana.”\nTwo experts who spoke to HuffPost said that Winfrey displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of why licensure of psychologists is important.\nHeather Austin, a licensed psychologist practicing in Alabama who serves on the board of the Alabama Psychological Association (she did not speak to HuffPost on behalf of the association) said that licensure ensures that the board can monitor the activities of practicing psychologists.\n“Someone who isn’t licensed doesn’t have a legal responsibility to take care of a patient in an ethical manner. If you’re not a licensed professional, you’re not operating under a board, which means that no one is ensuring that you are offering services that are appropriate. No one is ensuring that someone is offering evidence-based treatment in an ethical manner. Without licensure, the ability for the board to regulate that is minimized, it’s very difficult for the board to protect patients otherwise.”\xa0\n\nSomeone who isn’t licensed doesn’t have a legal responsibility to take care of a patient in an ethical manner.\nHeather Austin, who serves on the board of the Alabama Psychological Association\n\nThe licensing process to become a board-certified psychologist, which includes a requirement for a criminal background check, can be cumbersome, but experts say it’s a critical vetting process to ensure that members of the public are receiving care from the best practitioners.\nIn Georgia, where Winfrey lived and offered her curriculum from 2009 to 2014, the code governing psychologists says: “A person who is not licensed under this chapter shall not practice psychology, shall not use the title “psychologist,” and shall not imply that he or she is a psychologist.”\nThe law in Alabama, where Winfrey is running for Congress and has lived and referred to herself as a clinical psychologist, says: “No person shall hold himself or herself out to the public as a licensed psychological technician or practice as a psychological technician unless licensed by the board. Failure to comply with this section shall constitute a Class B misdemeanor.”\nIf charged with a Class B misdemeanor in Alabama, the defendant could receive up to six months of jail time and be fined up to $3,000.\nEven if Winfrey had not offered her curriculum or the group therapy sessions to troubled youth and merely held herself out to the public as a psychologist during her campaign (which she did repeatedly), she would be in violation of Alabama law, according to an official at the Alabama Board of Examiners in Psychology.\nWinfrey is facing Mallory Hagan, a former Miss America and news anchor, in Tuesday’s Democratic primary. Whoever wins that contest will run against Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, who has held the seat since 2003, in November.\nThis is a developing story.

Teams could be fined if their players sit or kneel on the field, as many have done in recent months in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.\nTrump and Vice President Mike Pence had roundly criticized such kneeling and used the protests to attack players as unpatriotic, at times calling for a boycott of the NFL.\n“It was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement announcing the move last month. “This is not and was never the case. This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.”\nEagles players issued their own criticism of the new league policy, including Long, who said it was “not patriotism.”\n“This is fear of a diminished bottom line.

 {'title': 'Bill Clinton Deployed A Tactic Used By Trump In Interview About Monica Lewinsky',
  'body': "\nIn an interview on Monday, with his arms crossed protectively over his chest, former President Bill Clinton used classic perpetrator tactics to fend off questions about what transpired between him and Monica Lewinsky 20 years ago. \nIn doing so he missed a real opportunity to grapple honestly with his past.\nClinton was asked if he would handle the Lewinsky affair differently if he were president in 2018 ― in light of how the Me Too movement has changed perceptions of sex and power. Lewinsky herself recently wrote about the way she now sees the affair in light of Me Too. \n“Do you view [the Lewinsky affair] differently or feel more responsibility?” the “Today” show’s Craig Melvin asked Clinton, who was appearing on the show with author James Patterson to promote their new book.\n“No. I felt terrible then and I came to grips with it,” Clinton said ― offering no thoughts as to whether Lewinsky might have also had to grapple with their relationship. \nIt got worse. “Did you ever apologize to her?” Melvin asked.\n“No. Yes,” Clinton said, incomprehensibly, later explaining that he apologized to the nation.\nClinton quickly moved on to painting himself as a victim and attacking Melvin for daring to ask about this: “Nobody believes that I got out of that for free,” Clinton said. “I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you, typically, have ignored gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don’t even know them.” \nHe later lashed out at Melvin more. “You are giving one side,” he said, pointing his long finger. “And omitting facts.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNBC/“Today” show\n\n\nBill Clinton, arms folded defensively, with James Patterson on the “Today” show Monday morning.\n\n\n\nIt could’ve been a moment of real self-reflection. Instead, Clinton elided responsibility for his actions, and declined to seriously wrestle with what happened through a modern lens. \n“This is not the statement of accountability I wish he would’ve shown,” said Jennifer Freyd, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon who has written about the way perpetrators and institutions defend themselves against misconduct allegations.\nInstead, Clinton used a version of a strategy that Freyd calls “DARVO.” She coined the term in 1997, a year before the Lewinksy scandal broke\xa0on the home page of the Drudge Report. The abbreviation stands for Deny the behavior, attack the accuser, and reverse the roles of victim and offender.\xa0\nIn other words, when confronted with a credible accusation or a question about misconduct, you say it never happened, lash out against the victim and paint yourself as the one who is truly suffering. (Recall Clinton’s initial denial of the affair ― “I did not have sexual relations with that woman. These allegations are false” ― which was both a denial and a subtle smear.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recently, Ashley Judd spoke about DARVO tactics in discussing the behavior of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who infamously destroyed the reputations of women who wouldn’t sleep with him. \xa0\nPresident Donald Trump is perhaps the most prototypical DARVO offender. He’s denied the accounts of more than a dozen women who’ve accused him of sexual misconduct. He’s called them “horrible people” and “horrible liars,” and\xa0attacked their looks. And he casts himself as a victim, blaming Democrats for coming after him with what he says are phony stories. \xa0\n“He’s just so classic,” Freyd said. \nClinton didn’t go as far as to attack Lewinsky, Freyd said. She at first didn’t think Monday’s interview rose to the level of DARVO, but after watching a few times, she changed her mind.\nClinton’s tactics were more nuanced, Freyd said. He didn’t come straight out and call himself a victim, but mentioning his eight figures of debt did the trick. \nThe whole interview was disappointing, she said.\n“Clinton still has a lot of power and influence. He could’ve used that to show courage and it could’ve been healing and powerful,” Freyd said. “I wanted him to say, ‘Yeah, I made a mistake. I am deeply sorry and if I could do it all over again, I wouldn’t.’”\nFreyd emphasized that the issue is not the legality of the affair,\xa0or the question of whether Clinton should’ve remained in office.\xa0She’d simply hoped he would acknowledge the vast power differential between a president and an intern, and recognize that the idea of consenting adults gets murky when it comes to a boss sleeping with a subordinate whose whole job is to serve him ― especially when the boss is also the leader of the free world.\n\nWhen confronted with a credible accusation or a question about misconduct, you say it never happened, lash out against the victim and paint yourself as the one who is truly suffering.\n\nFreyd has been studying the issue as it occurs on college campuses, where relationships between professors and students are increasingly frowned upon for the same reason.\nCultural awareness about sex and power has changed so much over the past 20 years, going into a hyperdrive shift with Me Too and accounts from women about men like Weinstein and Trump. \nIn light of these evolving viewpoints, many women’s stories have been essentially re-examined and rewritten. We now understand that Anita Hill was unfairly attacked after she accused Clarence Thomas of harassment, that O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark was viewed with a denigrating sexist eye and that Lewinsky was treated as a pariah by the press simply because of her status and gender. The way Bill Clinton’s own wife has been treated is a genre unto itself.\nLewinsky has changed her own views on the Clinton affair in light of Me Too. For years, she insisted their affair was purely consensual. Then this year, she acknowledged the massive power differential that existed between her and Clinton back when she was a 22-year-old intern. \n“He was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet. He was 27 years my senior, with enough life experience to know better,” she wrote in Vanity Fair earlier this year.\xa0“I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.”\nOn Monday, Lewinsky shared the piece again on\xa0Twitter\xa0in what seemed to be a gentle response to the Clinton interview, writing: “Grateful to the myriad people who have helped me evolve + gain perspective in the past 20 years.”\n",

Joe Crowley.\nThe 28-year-old, who has never held elected office, is challenging Crowley ― chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, described by some as “one of the most powerful” Democrats in the House ― who has been in Congress for nearly two decades. \nThe Latina millennial, born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican mom and a Bronxite dad, is running on a boldly progressive platform, including ideas like Medicare for all, which have become more mainstream among Democratic Party leaders in recent years, and other more radical proposals, like abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and having a federal job guarantee. \nThe newcomer is one of several Democratic candidates in 2018 challenging seats held not by Republicans but by longtime Democrats ― such as state Sen. Kevin de León trying to unseat Sen. Dianne Feinstein in California. \nOcasio is also part of a wave of women running for office since President Donald Trump’s election ― with some historic victories in primaries so far for Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Lupe Valdez in Texas. \nThe district in New York she hopes to represent, which encompasses parts of the Bronx and Queens,\xa0is one of the most diverse areas in the country.\xa0\n“Our district is overwhelmingly people of color, it’s working class, it’s very immigrant ― and it hasn’t had the representation we’ve needed,” Ocasio told HuffPost by phone Thursday. She referred to Crowley, 56 ― who is white and a New Yorker from a middle-class Irish family ― as a “more middle-of-the-road” candidate “financed by corporations.” \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“I just don’t think it’s good enough,” she added. “After 20 years of the same leadership, it’s time for a new day.”\nIt’s worth noting that Crowley’s political track record includes supporting progressive policies like\xa0co-sponsoring the Medicare for All Act,\xa0signing onto legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, and supporting closing New York’s notorious Rikers Island\xa0prison.\xa0\nThe odds are heavily stacked against Ocasio.\xa0Her fundraising numbers are a fraction of Crowley’s, with about $250,000 raised to her name so far, according to her team, compared to Crowley’s approximately $1.5 million, per OpenSecrets. \xa0\n\n\n\nIn a recent political ad,\xa0which made waves on social media and which Ocasio wrote herself, the millennial touts her working-class roots and her campaign’s refusal to take corporate money.\n“I’m not running from the left; I’m running from the bottom,” she told HuffPost. “I’m running in fierce advocacy for working-class New Yorkers.” \nShe was born in the Bronx and moved to the wealthier suburb of Yorktown at a young age, in her parents’ effort to provide her with access to better schools. But with her dad’s small business and much of her family remaining in the Bronx, she felt like she grew up “between two worlds.” \n“My cousins had different schools, quality of life, different air than me, because of the ZIP Codes where we [lived],” Ocasio said. “I know what it’s like to access the privilege of a ZIP Code but also be born in one that could have destined me to something else.” \n“A generation later, my nieces and nephews are facing the same inequity,” she added. “It’s not going stop unless we make it stop.” \nWhile in college at Boston University, she interned and worked in the immigration office of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), where, as one of the only Latinas and Spanish speakers, she became intimately familiar with the struggles of undocumented immigrants. Of her proposal to abolish ICE, she says it’s not “as radical” as “separating parents from their babies” ― referring to a recent policy from the Trump administration to split migrant parents and kids at the border, which has sparked outrage. \nWhen Ocasio’s father died at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and her mom had to go back to work cleaning houses and driving a bus, Ocasio took shifts as a waitress to pitch in. After she graduated college in 2011, she moved back to the Bronx. She later became an educator with the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute, and volunteered as an organizer on Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, she launched her own bid for office.\n\n\n\n\nCorey Torpie\n\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez talks with potential voters in the Queens borough of New York City.\n\n\n\nPushing a progressive platform, including a $15 minimum wage and ending private prisons, her grassroots team has made it a point to not take corporate PAC money ― because “it’s disingenuous to... pretend the sources of our money don’t impact the policy we write ― you just can’t serve two masters,” she said.\nCrowley accepts donations from corporate PACs and companies’ employees or owners. While about three-quarters of Ocasio’s campaign donations are\xa0small, under-$200 contributions, less than 1 percent of Crowley’s funds are, according to OpenSecrets.\xa0\n“Joe would be the first to aggressively overhaul the campaign finance system,” Crowley’s campaign spokesperson Vijay Chaudhuri told HuffPost by email. “But until Republicans have to give up money, Joe refuses to relegate Democrats to a permanent minority.”\nIf without corporate funds Ocasio’s campaign coffers have floundered compared to the incumbent’s, she doesn’t seem too ruffled: “Money doesn’t tell the whole story,” she said, pointing to door-knocking and other on-the-ground campaign efforts she and her team have done in the district.\nWhile the progressive newcomer has garnered the support of significant left-wing groups, such as the Democratic Socialists of America and People for Bernie, Crowley holds endorsements from prominent groups like the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and immigrant organization Make the Road, as well as major labor unions like the New York State AFL-CIO and the SEIU. \nEven if she doesn’t win the primary on June 26 ― and her odds are slim ― she says that simply the fact that she ran will have been worth it “1,000 percent.” The election, she noted, will be the first time Crowley faces a primary challenge to his seat in 14 years.\xa0\n“Regardless of what happens on June 26, we activated, trained and mobilized hundreds in a district that hadn’t been mobilized before. That is permanent,” Ocasio said. \n“I see people like me, who thought someone like me couldn’t be in politics, now are saying, ‘Oh, wait, I don’t need to take money from corporations to run. Maybe I’ll run too.’”\nCLARIFICATION: This article previously described Crowley as receiving “corporate donations.” The wording has been changed to clarify that these donations are from corporate PACs and companies’ employees or owners.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nCorey Torpie\n\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez hopes her campaign’s on-the-ground efforts will help make up for the huge gap in fundraising\xa0with her opponent.\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Asked Aide To Buy Used Trump Mattress, Book Flights On Personal Time',
  'body': '\nOddjob wasn’t just a classic James Bond villain ― it’s also apparently the job description for any position under embattled Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt.\nThat’s according to testimony released Monday by two Democrats in a letter to Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\nIn particular, Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Gerald Connolly (D-Va.), clued in on statements made by Pruitt’s director of scheduling and advance Millan Hupp, whom Pruitt regularly asked to do personal tasks for him, likely in violation of federal ethics laws.\nAmong the requests detailed in Monday’s release are these oddities:\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Scott Pruitt asked Hupp to look into buying “an old mattress”\xa0from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Hupp told investigators she wasn’t sure what, exactly, Pruitt wanted the used Trump mattress for, or if he ended up buying it. To the best of her knowledge, it wasn’t for EPA business.\xa0\nPruitt asked Hupp to book personal travel for him, at one point contacting Hupp while she was on vacation over Christmas and instructing her to book flights so he could see the Rose Bowl.\nAt Pruitt’s direction, Hupp spent “several hours per week over the course of several months”\xa0personally researching and visiting rental properties for the EPA administrator to move into. Pruitt and his wife ultimately selected an apartment Hupp found, but then moved out soon after because “they were not comfortable in the area,”\xa0Hupp said. (This is about the same time Pruitt was renting an apartment from the wife of a prominent energy lobbyist at below-market rates.)\n\n“If Ms. Hupp’s statements to the Committee are accurate, Administrator Pruitt crossed a very clear line and must be held accountable,” Reps. Connolly and Cummings wrote. “Federal ethics law prohibits Administrator Pruitt from using his official position for personal gain and from requesting and accepting services from a subordinate employee that are not part of that employee’s official duties.”\nMonday’s revelations are the latest in a long, long string of questionable activity undertaken at Pruitt’s behest.\nOver the weekend, we learned Pruitt has an appetite for fancy pens, and reportedly spent\xa0$3,230 last August at a D.C. jewelry store on a dozen silver fountain pens and some personalized journals ― at taxpayer expense.\xa0\nIn April, the Government Accountability Office concluded the EPA chief’s decision to install a $43,000 soundproof phone booth was illegal. And presumably there are a number of other ongoing investigations into Pruitt’s extensive use of first-class travel, expensive security detail, and official visits to international locales\xa0with no clear relation to his work at the EPA.\nDo you know more about what’s going on with Pruitt’s aides? We’d love to hear from you.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nPruitt Enjoyed Coal Baron’s VIP Sports Seats As EPA Cut Back On Regulations\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Senate Hot Seat, Scott Pruitt Dodges Questions Over Mounting Scandals\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Pruitt Got 24/7 Security From Day 1 At EPA\n\n\n\n',

He also allegedly improperly sold export-controlled technology.\n“His alleged actions are a betrayal of our nation’s security and the American people and are an affront to his former intelligence community colleagues,” said John Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.\nAccording to court records, the FBI started investigating his activities in 2014. He was unaware of the probe, and participated in nine voluntary meetings with federal agents in Salt Lake City. Utah.\nProsecutors say that during his meetings, he told the FBI that Chinese intelligence had tried to recruit him, offered to cooperate as a source and even provided thumb drives to the FBI that contained classified materials he was not authorized to have.\nHansen appeared before a magistrate judge in Seattle on Monday, and is charged in a 15-count complaint.\xa0\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

If the top finisher in each race wins a majority of votes, they will win the district attorney office seat. If no single candidate captures the majority of votes, the top two candidates with the most votes will move on to a final round in November. California district attorney races are technically nonpartisan, so candidates are often not identified by political party.\nHere are seven races to watch:\n\n\n\n\nFred Greaves / Reuters\n\n\nSacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert announces the arrest of a suspect in the Golden State Killer case on April 25. She has faced criticism for refusing to pursue charges against police officers.\n\n\n\nSacramento County (population: 1.5 million)\nCandidate Noah Phillips, who identifies as a lifelong Democrat, is a deputy prosecutor in the Sacramento County district attorney’s office who is in a heated race against his boss, incumbent DA Anne Marie Schubert, a registered Republican.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSchubert, the county’s DA since 2014, has been plagued by criticism after clearing police officers involved in recent controversial killings of unarmed black men. In 2016, Schubert did not bring charges against officers who attempted to run over a mentally ill, homeless black man before\xa0shooting him to death. Nor has she brought charges against the officers who shot and killed 22-year-old Stephon Clark in the yard of his grandmother’s home. Clark’s death sparked large protests in Sacramento. Schubert is also a leading proponent of the use of the death penalty in the state. \nPhillips, who has served in the DA’s office for more than two decades, supports reforming cash bail practices, reforming police practices, protecting undocumented immigrants and expanding resources to inmates reentering society after their release. Following the Clark killing, Phillips announced he’d address racial disparities in the criminal justice system. He’s won the endorsement of the Real Justice political action committee, a group focused on electing reform-minded district attorneys around the nation, and Color of Change political action committee, a progressive group helping to mobilize black voters to elect reform-minded candidates around the nation.\nYolo County (population: 200,000)\nAdjacent to Sacramento County in Yolo, deputy public defender Dean Johansson is challenging incumbent DA Jeff Reisig, who is seeking his fourth term.\nReisig, who has not faced an opponent since first running for the office more than a decade ago, has enacted some reforms while in office, notably a community court that aims to help keep low-level offenders out of the criminal justice system and has been called “progressive enough” by the Sacramento Bee editorial board. But Reisig has been criticized for not doing enough to reduce the racial disparities of charges and incarceration in Yolo County. \nRunning on a broad reform platform, Johansson, who has won the endorsement of the local Democratic Party, has pledged to support diversion programs for youth offenders to help keep them out of the criminal justice system, end practices that criminalize poverty, mental illness and substance abuse, and stop seeking the death penalty in the county’s cases.\xa0\nContra Costa County (population: 1.1 million)\nDiana Becton, a retired judge and current interim district attorney for the county, is running against Senior Deputy District Attorney Paul Graves.\nGraves has worked in the county DA’s office for more than two decades as a prosecutor and is head of the family violence and sexual assault unit. He’s won the endorsement of the East Bay Times Editorial Board, which said Graves, with his 22 years of experience as a prosecutor in the county DA’s office, was its clear choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecton, the first woman and first African-American to lead Contra Costa County’s DA office, took over after the last DA was forced to resign in disgrace following a felony perjury conviction. Becton has pledged to reform cash bail practices, reduce racial disparities in sentencing and improve the outcomes for inmates reentering society. She’s also won the support of the local Democratic Party and\xa0the endorsement of the progressive political action committees Real Justice and Color of Change.\xa0\nAlameda County (population: 1.6 million)\nIncumbent Nancy O’Malley is facing the first challenger in her career as DA of Alameda County in civil rights attorney Pamela Price.\nO’Malley, who was first appointed by the county Board of Supervisors in 2009 and ran unopposed in 2010 and 2014, is the first woman to serve as DA in the county. She’s been lauded for various efforts in office, including the curbing of human trafficking and the clearing of past marijuana convictions in compliance with California’s marijuana laws. But has also faced criticisms, most recently for taking a $10,000 contribution from the Fremont police union while she was investigating three cops, one of whom was head of the union, for their involvement in two fatal shootings last year. She later cleared the officers of any wrongdoing in the cases. She’s been endorsed by the local Democratic Party.\xa0\nProgressive reformer Price, an advocate for criminal justice reform, has campaigned on ending cash bail, expanding alternative programs to help some offenders avoid incarceration, protecting undocumented immigrants and has pledged to create a police accountability unit to review allegations of misconduct by cops. She’s also received endorsements of the progressive political action committees Color of Change and Real Justice.\xa0\nRiverside County (population: 2.3 million)\nIncumbent veteran prosecutor Mike Hestrin is facing off against defense attorney Lara Gressley in Riverside County.\nAs district attorney, Republican Hestrin has pursued the tough-on-crime policies the office is known for. But he has also pursued innovations, expanding alternative sentencing programs and supporting crime prevention programs aimed at keeping at-risk youths from falling into the criminal justice system and reducing recidivism. \nGressley, who does not identify as either Democrat or Republican, has pledged to restore balance to the system. She supports alternative sentencing programs, including the ones Hestrin has implemented, but believes they could be further developed and better funded. She also supports cash bail reform and community crime prevention programs with the aim of reducing incarceration.\xa0\nSan Diego County (population: 3.3 million)\nIn San Diego County, Democratic public defender Geneviéve Jones-Wright is challenging Republican incumbent Summer Stephan, who was appointed last year. \nStephan is a career prosecutor who has served in the office for nearly three decades. She’s been lauded for her work in combating sex crimes and human trafficking. She also helped to establish diversion programs in the county, including one that aims to help homeless people who commit low-level offenses avoid convictions.\xa0But Stephan has been criticized for her lack of action reforming cash bail practices. Color of Change PAC, which\xa0endorsed\xa0Jones-Wright, said Stephan is “not committed to reforming policies that disproportionately harm Black and Brown people.”\nJones-Wright is running a campaign pledging sweeping changes for the criminal justice system in the county, including reforming cash bail practices, establishing a DA-appointed panel to review police officer shootings, supporting alternatives to incarceration, avoiding charges for some low-level offenses and enacting restorative justice programs. She has also received an endorsement from Real Justice.\nSan Bernardino County (population: 2.1 million)\nIn San Bernardino County, former deputy district attorney turned defense attorney Jason Anderson is facing off against incumbent DA Michael Ramos, who is seeking his fifth term as San Bernardino’s top prosecutor.\nServing 16 years as district attorney, Ramos, a Republican, has long pursued aggressive policies in the region, notably through the crackdown of gang offenders. He’s long faced criticism for fighting the release of William Richards, a man wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife. Ramos fought for more than a decade to keep Richards, who was finally released in 2016, behind bars.\nAnderson, who has received an endorsement from the progressive Color of Change PAC, has pledged to address racial disparities in charging and sentencing, establish a restorative justice program for adults with criminal records and increase transparency in office operations. \n',

 {'title': 'Arizona Settles Lawsuit To Make It Easier To Register To Vote',
  'body': '\nArizona reached an agreement on Monday with two groups suing the state to add voters to the rolls regardless of what form they use to register to vote or whether they provide proof of citizenship. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona law requires people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote in state elections, but the two groups that sued, the Arizona office of the League of United Latin American Citizens\xa0and the Arizona Students Association, said the state’s process for registering people was unconstitutionally complex. The groups said the system was preventing tens of thousands of people from getting on the rolls ― something the agreement is designed to remedy. \xa0\nArizonans can use either a state or federal\xa0form to register to vote. But under the state’s current system, the form they registered with could affect which elections they could vote in. If a voter used the federal form, but did not provide proof they were a citizen, they would only be registered to vote in federal elections if the state did not have other evidence on file that they were a citizen. \nIf a voter used the state form but failed to provide proof of citizenship, 14 of the state’s 15 counties would reject their application outright and they wouldn’t be registered in any election. The plaintiffs in the case said that in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous, the policy resulted in at least 26,000 people being blocked from voting. \nThe new agreement requires the state to accept voter registration applications, regardless of whether a person can prove their citizenship at the time of registration. However, the agreement also requires the state to check Arizona’s motor vehicle database to see if the applicant has already proved they are a citizen (the state requires people to show proof of citizenship to get a driver’s license). If the state’s check finds that a person hasn’t provided proof of citizenship to the DMV, the person is notified that they will only be registered to vote in federal elections until they provide proof of citizenship to the state. \nDanielle Lang, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, one of the groups that represented the plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement that the system that had been in place in the state was a “bureaucratic nightmare.”\n“Our lawsuit will successfully protect eligible Arizonans from being unfairly prevented from registering to vote and participating in federal elections because of unnecessary requirements,” Lang said. \nCourts have blocked states from asking people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote using the federal form, but states have been permitted to ask for proof of citizenship when they use the state forms. In Kansas, for example, a federal judge in 2016 blocked the state from asking people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote, but the state has continued to require proof of citizenship when people use the state form. \nIn the November complaint, LULAC, a Latino civil rights group, and ASA, a coalition of college students, said the state’s requirements also made voter registration drives difficult because potential new voters have drastically different access to proof-of-citizenship documents. Whether or not a given person would ultimately become registered, the groups said, could depend on which form a voter registration drive organizer chose to use. \nIn the agreement, known as a consent decree, Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R) and Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes both maintained that they had the legal authority to require potential new voters to submit proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Nonetheless, they said they wanted to settle the case because they wanted to make it as easy as possible for Arizonans to register to vote.\n“The registration system will now verify the eligibility of each and every person who has yet to provide evidence of citizenship,” Reagan said in a statement. “With this agreement in place we’ll have confirmed an individual’s eligibility before issuing them a ballot with any state elections listed. While the Supreme Court has ordered Arizona to allow people who have not provided such proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, it’s a relief the system will now proactively verify eligibility for all applicants.”\n“We’ve always said that it should be easy to vote and hard to cheat,” she continued. “I’m proud to say this compromise achieves both. Voters will now have the clarity they need along with a heightened level of election integrity.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nThis Election Official Could Be Breaking The Law To Help Register People To Vote.

  'body': '\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.\xa0Supreme Court on Monday handed a narrow victory to a Christian baker from Colorado who refused for religious reasons to make a wedding cake for a gay couple.\nThe justices, in a 7-2 decision, faulted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission’s handling of the claims brought against Jack Phillips, saying it had showed a hostility to religion. In doing so, the commission violated his religious rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nBut the court did not issue a definitive ruling on the circumstances under which people can seek exemptions from anti-discrimination laws based on their religious views.\nThe commission had said Phillips violated the Colorado anti-discrimination law that bars businesses from refusing service based on race, sex, marital status or sexual orientation by rebuffing gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the court’s four liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, joined the five conservative justices in the ruling authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n“The commission’s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion,” Kennedy wrote, referring to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n“The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in thecourts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market,” Kennedy said.\nOf the 50 states, 21 including Colorado have anti-discrimination laws protecting gay people.\nThe closely watched case before the Supreme Court, which in 2015 legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, pitted gay rights against religious liberty. President Donald Trump’s administration intervened in the case in support of Phillips.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)\nRead the opinion below:\n Masterpiece Cake Shop Supreme Court Ruling by Anonymous FBZLGr on Scribd\n',

 {'title': 'Judge Rules Printing ‘In God We Trust’ On Currency Honors America’s Heritage',
  'body': "\nA federal court in Chicago has ruled that printing “In God we trust” on U.S. currency doesn’t violate a Satanist’s rights under the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that the motto is not an endorsement of a particular religion but rather a phrase that “merely acknowledges a part of our nation’s heritage (albeit a religious part).”\n“The motto’s placement on currency has the secular purpose of recognizing the religious component of our nation’s history,” Chief Judge Diane Wood wrote in her opinion. “And it does not affect current religious practices.”\nKenneth Mayle, a Chicago man who follows what he calls\xa0“nontheistic Satanism,” argued that the motto forces him to affirm and spread a religious message that contradicts his religious beliefs. Mayle also claimed the motto discriminated against adherents of religions that are not monotheistic.\nThe phrase “In God we trust” started\xa0appearing on U.S. coins in 1864\xa0as a result of heightened religious sentiment during the Civil War. It was partly a reaction to Southern leaders’\xa0decision to declare the Confederacy a Christian nation. President Abraham Lincoln opposed moves to amend the U.S. Constitution to state the same, so Northern Protestant leaders settled on adding the motto to coins.\n\n\n\n\nMyLoupe via Getty Images\n\n\nA silver dollar from 1887.\xa0“In God we trust” started appearing on U.S. coins in 1864, partly\xa0in reaction to the Confederacy’s declaring itself a Christian nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest in the phrase resurfaced during the Cold War,\xa0as American lawmakers sought ways to distinguish the country’s religious heritage from the atheism espoused by communist countries. In 1956, Congress voted for “In God we trust”\xa0as the national motto of the United States. The motto was first used on paper money in 1957.\nThe phrase has been challenged by atheists and other religious minorities, but judges have largely dismissed these challenges, saying that the motto is a reference to America’s religious heritage.\xa0\nIn a 1977 case\xa0the Supreme Court ruled\xa0that people who use U.S. currency are not advertising the national motto, since money “is generally carried in a purse or pocket, and need not be displayed to the public.”\nA lower court dismissed Mayle’s lawsuit in October, and the federal appeals court affirmed that decision on Thursday.\xa0\n“The Cold War was at its height during the mid-1950s, and so it is just as accurate to say that the motto was placed on U.S. currency to celebrate our tradition of religious freedom, as compared with the communist hostility to religion,” Wood wrote in the opinion. “Moreover, even if the motto was added to currency in part because of religious sentiment, it was also done to commemorate that part of our nation’s heritage.”\nThis isn’t the first time Mayle has attempted to defend his Satanist beliefs in court.\xa0In April 2017, a federal judge in Chicago tossed out a lawsuit that he brought against an Illinois law that prohibits adultery.\xa0He claimed that Satanism encourages adultery and that the defunct law had a “chilling effect” on his relationships.\nIllinois, like many other states, still has anti-adultery laws on the books that are no longer enforced. The judge found that Mayle had no grounds to sue, the Associated Press reported.\n",

 {'title': 'Jury Finds Yet Another Trump Inauguration Protester Not Guilty Of Felony Charges',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― A jury found a defendant arrested on President Donald Trump’s inauguration day not guilty of rioting charges on Monday, another setback in the Justice Department’s attempt to convict protesters of felonies stemming from property destruction in the nation’s capital as Trump took office.\nCasey Webber was one of more than 200 people arrested en masse after black-clad demonstrators smashed windows in downtown Washington. Prosecutors originally charged more than 200 people with felonies in connection with the destruction. But after a jury acquitted the first group of defendants on all charges, prosecutors in January dropped charges against 129 other defendants, saying they’d instead focus on a “core group” of 59 defendants they said were most responsible for the destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, one defendant took a guilty plea and charges against 10 others\xa0were dropped last week because prosecutors withheld evidence. With the not guilty verdict in Webber’s case, 47 defendants still face felony counts.\nWebber was charged with engaging in a riot and conspiracy to riot, as well as five counts of destruction of property that prosecutors said he should be held responsible for as part of a rioting conspiracy.\nUnlike the other three defendants whose cases are pending before the jury, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia never alleged that Webber damaged any property on Jan. 20, 2017. But, like the first six defendants to go on trial last year, the government told jurors that Webber should be held responsible for any damage done by the group of protesters.\nThe judge had previously acquitted Webber on a felony charge of inciting a riot, finding that no reasonable jury could have convicted him on that count based on the evidence presented by the government.\nApril Downs, a lawyer representing Webber, told HuffPost after the verdict that she believes the government should never have brought a case against her client.\n“He is a Quaker, and he acted like one throughout,” Downs said. “He was completely non-violent and always acted that way and spoke that way.”\nIn closing arguments last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Rizwan Qureshi, a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, told jurors that this was “not a typical riot” because it was “not something that was spontaneous,” like when sports fans destroy property after a win or loss. “In the city I grew up in they put Crisco on the poles whether we win or lose,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in this case, Qureshi said, the actions weren’t spontaneous, and the defendants “agreed on Jan. 20th to destroy your city” and were now trying to “hide behind the First Amendment.”\nIn their closings, defense attorneys raised questions about the government’s attempts to identify their clients using videos that captured the property destruction.\nSeth Schrager, ― who represents Seth Cadman, one of those whose case is still before the jury ― questioned whether a video really showed his client throwing an object toward a window and whether it actually hit anything.\xa0\nThe government’s conspiracy theory, Schrager said, depends on the “fiction” that the protests were well-planned. “There was no way this mess was well organized,” he said.\nHe also argued that the chief detective in the case, Gregg Pemberton a member of Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department who sent anti-activist tweets, had a “right-wing bias.”\nSchrager also said that democracy could be obnoxious and loud, and noted the chaos that marked the Boston Tea Party in the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. A lot of people, he said, have concerns about the United States trending toward fascism.\nThe government alleged that the other two defendants, Michael Basillas and Anthony Felice, engaged in vandalism, and say that Felice resisted arrest by trying to escape when police encircled the group.\nJust as the case went to jury, one of panel’s members wrote a note to the judge saying that someone had written “Google jury nullification” in a bathroom stall. She said she looked up the term, which refers to the practice of a jury voting a defendant not guilty not based on the evidence, but rather because they don’t believe in a law or don’t support the possible punishment for breaking the law. She said she discussed the term with other jurors.\n\n\n\nAfter delivering their not guilty verdict in Webber’s case, the jury continued deliberating on the other three cases on Monday afternoon.\n\nRELATED...\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Inauguration Charges Dismissed Because Prosecutors Withheld Evidence\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Prosecutors Still Trying To Turn Trump Inauguration Protesters Into Felons\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Department Drops Felony Charges Against 129 Trump Inauguration Defendants\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

You people will have to be in Singapore,” he told reporters at the White House. He said he had just met with Kim Yong Chol, North Korea’s top nuclear weapons negotiator.\nIn long, meandering comments Friday afternoon, Trump said that he received a “very nice letter” from Kim Jong Un.\xa0\nLater, he said that he had not read it yet: “I may be in for a big surprise, folks.”\nTrump said he hoped the meeting would be “ultimately successful” but said he did not expect concrete results, like North Korea’s denuclearization, stressing that the meeting is “the start of a process.”\n“Remember what I say, we will see what we will see,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump\xa0speaks to the media after meeting with North Korean diplomat Kim Yong Chol on\xa0Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Trump’s abrupt cancellation last week of the historic meeting with Kim, there’s been an international scramble to salvage the event — with rapid-fire diplomacy efforts in the U.S., on the Korean Peninsula and in Singapore, the Southeast Asian city-state hosting the summit.\nKim Yong Chol\xa0arrived in New York on Wednesday for talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The diplomat is the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the U.S. since 2000, when Jo Myong Rok, the late vice marshal, met with then-President Bill Clinton in Washington.\nIn Singapore, Kim Chang Son, another of Kim Jong Un’s top aides, met with Joe Hagin, a deputy White House chief of staff, earlier in the week to iron out the logistics of a potential meeting, including security,\xa0venue spaces and transportation, reported The Washington Post.\nOn Sunday, officials from North Korea and the U.S. met for talks at the “truce village” in the Demilitarized Zone that separates the Korean Peninsula. President Trump said in a tweet that officials were there to “make arrangements for the summit.” One day prior, South Korean President Moon Jae In ― who was reportedly blindsided by Trump’s decision to pull out of the summit ― traveled to the DMZ for an impromptu meeting with Kim Jong Un. Moon later told reporters that the two leaders agreed the summit “must be successfully held.”\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\nWith the summit now back on the table, attention will likely shift to the substance of the meeting and whether Trump and Kim will be able to get on the same page about how to best denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.\xa0\nCho Myoung Gyon, the South Korean unification minister, warned this week that “significant” differences remain between the U.S. and North Korea on how to achieve denuclearization.\n“It will not be easy to narrow the gap and find common ground,” he said, according to the Yonhap News Agency. Cho added, however, that “it would not be impossible” and said he was heartened by the diplomatic efforts undertaken by the two countries in recent days.\n“Now that the leaders of the two countries are engaging in talks in a top-down manner, I think the chances are high that common ground can be found,”\xa0Cho said.\nMarina Fang contributed reporting.\n',

 {'title': 'Outrage Over Samantha Bee Should Pale In Comparison To Outrage Over Trump',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump\xa0called for TBS to fire Samantha Bee over her use of the phrase “feckless c**t” to describe his daughter and adviser Ivanka, sparking debate over his own famous history of foul language, including the word “pussy.”\n\n\n\nBut bickering over semantics misses a more urgent moral contradiction: Bee was name-calling. Trump was bragging about sexual assault.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Bee’s use of the word on her show was juvenile. And as Erin Gloria Ryan noted in The Daily Beast, it distracted from Bee’s larger point ― that Ivanka Trump could be doing a lot more to help keep immigrant kids from being separated from their parents. \nBut Trump’s remarks,\xa0captured while filming an episode of “Access Hollywood” in 2005, weren’t merely a verbal attack. He was bragging about violating not one, but multiple women, arguing his fame made it permissible. And the words weren’t just “locker-room talk” ― more than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.\nTrump’s comments are backed by the weight of his actions and the damage he’s inflicted upon women he “moved on” without their consent. Women like Mindy McGillivray, Karena Virginia and Ninni Laaksonen, who all claim Trump has groped them.\nOr women like Jessica Drake, Temple Taggart McDowell, Jennifer Murphy, Natasha Stoynoff and Cathy Heller, who all claim Trump kissed them without their consent. Or Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump’s show “The Apprentice” who said Trump not only forcibly kissed her on the mouth, but also thrusted his genitals at her. \nEven Ivana Trump, his ex-wife, was allegedly subject to his unwanted advances. She claimed he forced her to have sex with him. (Trump’s lawyer once argued a man can’t legally rape his wife.) Not to mention women who don’t want to be named, or haven’t come forward for fear of retaliation.\nTrump’s fame, the very thing he argued allowed his vile behavior, has even caused women he’s never met to experience anxiety, nausea, loss of appetite and panic attacks after his words triggered memories of their own experiences with sexual assault.\nBee’s remarks may have momentarily tarnished Ivanka Trump’s public image, but Donald Trump’s remarks elevated actions that weren’t just inappropriate, but illegal. The pearl-clutching over Bee’s use of a word once called “the most offensive curse word in English” should pale in comparison with the anger over a public figure joking about how he has violated women’s bodies.\nBut the fallout of each of their comments doesn’t reflect that. Bee lost advertisers, issued an apology and was chastised by the network she works for.\nTrump became president of the United States.\n',

 {'title': 'Mother Of Santa Fe Shooting Victim: Meeting With Donald Trump ‘Was Like Talking To A Toddler’',
  'body': '\nWhen President Donald Trump on Thursday met with victims, families and others affected by the shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, which left 10 people dead and 13 wounded, at least one parent was not impressed with his demeanor, continuing a pattern of the president failing to show empathy during tragedies.\nRhonda Hart, whose daughter, Kimberly Vaughan, was among eight students who died in the shooting last month, told The Associated Press her conversation with Trump “was like talking to a toddler.”\xa0\nAccording to Hart, Trump repeatedly brought up arming teachers, a policy proposal he has frequently promoted after school shootings.\xa0\n\nHart, an Army veteran, said she also suggested employing veterans as sentinels in schools. She said Trump responded, “And arm them?” She replied, “No,” but said Trump “kept mentioning” arming classroom teachers. “It was like talking to a toddler,” Hart said.\n\nShe said the president also focused on the shooter and his appearance, repeatedly describing him as “wacky.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting, which was closed to reporters.\nOn Thursday, deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters on Air Force One that the meeting was “very impactful” and “a very emotional time.”\n“I don’t want to get into the private meeting as it relates to the grieving families that experienced such a horrific tragedy. But it was very impactful. It was a very emotional time,” he said. “They’ve suffered a great loss and a great tragedy. And out of respect for them and the grieving process, I’m not going to get into the details of the meeting.”\nWhile presidents have long assumed the role of “consoler-in-chief” as part of their leadership duties, Trump has regularly demonstrated a lack of empathy in responding to tragedies, from school shootings to deadly storms.\nAfter the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, survivor Samantha Fuentes told The New York Times that Trump “didn’t make me feel better in the slightest” and that she had “never been so unimpressed by a person in my life.”\nDuring a White House listening session after the shooting, Trump was seen holding a notecard reminding him to tell victims and families that\xa0“I hear you.”\n\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\n\nTrump received backlash after being seen holding a notecard reminding him to tell shooting victims and families that “I hear you.”\n\n\n\nLast year, while touring hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, Trump downplayed the damage as not “a real catastrophe like Katrina,” told a family to “have a good time,” encouraged officials to praise him and the government’s widely criticized response to the storm and\xa0reveled in throwing paper towels\xa0to residents at a church.\nOther attendees of Thursday’s meeting with Trump reported more positive interactions. John Tisdale,\xa0the brother-in-law of substitute art teacher Cynthia Tisdale, wrote in a Facebook post that her widower,\xa0William, “enjoyed meeting President Trump Thursday.”\nGalveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset told the Houston Chronicle that Trump got emotional while listening to survivors.\n“He was concerned about what was going on with them, and the families,” he said. “He listened to their ideas, how things could be maybe put in a place to change or prevent this from happening again.”\nIf you have more information about Trump’s meeting, email marina.fang@huffpost.com.\nThis story has been updated with additional details from Trump’s meeting.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nParkland Survivor: ‘I’ve Never Been So Unimpressed By A Person’ After Trump Call\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Downplays Puerto Rico’s Suffering, Says It’s Not A ‘Real Catastrophe Like Katrina’\n\n\n\n\n\nNation’s Top Teachers Tell Trump About The Importance Of Empathy\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Needs Reminder To Listen To Parkland Survivors In ‘Listening Session’\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said the Republican Party is “taking a nap somewhere” after it was taken over by President Donald Trump.\n“There is no Republican Party,” he said at the Mackinac Policy Conference in Michigan on Thursday.\xa0“There’s a Trump Party.”\n\n\n\n\nNBC via Getty Images\n\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner\xa0says the Republican Party has been taken over by President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBoehner said Trump had been a supporter of his,\xa0and that the two played a lot of golf together.\xa0\n“But president, really? I never quite saw this,” he said to laughs.\xa0“But, y’know, the guy ran, the guy won.”\xa0\nBoehner also offered a theory about first lady Melania Trump:\xa0\n\n“I think Donald Trump promised Melania that he would not win. She didn’t have to worry about ever living in the White House. It’s probably why she doesn’t look real happy every day. Well, maybe one reason.”\n\nHowever, he also offered a defense of Trump on matters of policy.\xa0\n“If you can peel away the noise and the tweets and all that, which is virtually impossible to do, but if you peel all this away, from a Republican standpoint the things that he’s doing by and large are really good things,” Boehner said.\xa0\xa0\nPolitics is “just not fun” anymore, Boehner noted, which is why so many people are retiring. According to the Detroit News, he said the 2016 election was the result of not enough people voting in primaries. And that led to candidates from the fringes.\xa0\n“The way to solve this is for average Democrats and average Republicans to show up in a primary and elect people more like themselves,” he advised.\xa0\n',

 {'title': 'The Most Interesting Democratic Primary No One Is Talking About Is In New Mexico',
  'body': "\nALBUQUERQUE ― A wave of money from outside groups is transforming a Democratic primary in this historic mile-high city,\xa0making a former prosecutor and veteran the front-runner in a three-way battle with a Latina law professor and the potential first Native American woman in Congress.\nGroups supporting veterans,\xa0Latino candidates, women and Native Americans are creating a fracas on the airwaves with nearly $3 million in spending. The big money battle highlights how the party’s outside groups are clashing — not only over which candidates will battle Republicans in swing seats, but also over who will fill safely Democratic seats, where incumbents can play a role in shaping the party for decades to come and form a bench for statewide runs. (Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, who won re-election by 30 percentage points, is leaving the seat to run for governor.)\nEach of the leading candidates would be a star recruit in other districts: Damon Martinez, an Army veteran and former U.S. attorney, has the backing of veterans organizations VoteVets and With Honor; the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Latino Victory Fund are supporting Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, the first Latina to become a tenured professor at the University of New Mexico; and Deb Haaland, a former state party chair, is emphasizing the historic nature of her candidacy, earning endorsements from unions, progressive groups and the Native American group 7Gen Leaders.\xa0\n“We have an embarrassment of riches,” said Diane Denish, who served as lieutenant governor under former Gov. Bill Richardson and is backing Haaland in the contest.\xa0\nThe ideological differences are few\xa0— while Sedillo Lopez and Haaland claim some territory to the left of Martinez, all three candidates support Medicare for all, promise to push for tougher gun laws and believe there’s sufficient evidence to start writing articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. But each candidate represents a different group striving for more influence in the Democratic party in the Trump era, spurring heavy outside spending and the controversy that comes with it.\xa0\nMartinez has received the most outside support — raising fears groups with centrist or nonpartisan aims could hijack the primary, elevating a law-and-order candidate in a majority-minority seat.\xa0\nWith Honor supports both Democrats and Republicans, prompting the other campaigns to question Martinez’s progressive credentials. And the group’s heavy spending, along with mailers attacking Sedillo Lopez and Haaland from the No Labels-linked super PAC Forward Not Back, has prompted pro-abortion rights organization EMILY’s List to attack Martinez\xa0— an unusual move in a race where they haven’t endorsed a candidate.\xa0\n“We need more problem-solvers and leaders.”\xa0\n\nThe television ads backing Martinez are ubiquitous enough that when he knocked on a voter’s door in Albuquerque’s South Valley neighborhood, he was greeted by an image of himself on TV.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s time to send Trump a message: Our progressive values can’t be fired,” the narrator of the VoteVets ad said, referencing Martinez’s forced resignation from the U.S. Attorney job when Trump took office. “That’s why we’re sending a progressive veteran, Damon Martinez, to Congress to fight Donald Trump.”\nSimilar ads have helped him seize a slender lead in two recent polls from the Albuquerque Journal and an independent journalist. But it’s also generated controversy. While VoteVets exclusively supports Democrats, other groups supporting him aren’t as progressive.\nWith Honor backs veterans in both parties, including conservative candidates endorsed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and others. It requires candidates to sign a pledge promising to co-sponsor one major piece of bipartisan legislation every year as long as they are in Congress.\xa0And a super PAC that sent out mailers attacking Sedillo Lopez and Haaland has ties to the centrist group No Labels.\xa0\nWith Honor’s super PAC is funded by big donors: L Brands CEO Les Wexner and his wife Abigail combined to donate $2.8 million, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ parents chipped in another $1 million. Les Wexner has also donated $250,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee this cycle, and other With Honor and Forward Not Back donors have given to Trump and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the past.\xa0\n“If you look at where we are as a country, we need more problem-solvers and leaders like Damon Martinez,” said Ellen Zeng, the group’s political director and a former official at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\xa0\nMartinez, a 10th generation New Mexican whose family received a land grant from the Spanish monarchy, emphasizes “serious leadership” in his campaign. He talks about Albuquerque’s high crime rate and his work to secure the state’s two national laboratories\xa0— two issues the other candidates avoid almost entirely.\xa0\nHe argues his history of forcing change on institutions\xa0— pushing the University of New Mexico to revamp its handling of sexual assault cases, holding Chevron Mining accountable for pollution — shows he can check Trump in a way the other candidates can’t.\xa0\n“I understand the system and know how to hold people accountable,” he said. “It’s not just rhetoric on my part. I’m not afraid to make people mad.”\nThe places where Haaland and Sedillo Lopez outflank Martinez on the left are mostly related to law enforcement.\xa0While both women support abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Martinez will only commit to supporting a reorganization of the Department of Homeland Security. Haaland says Martinez “can’t be a progressive” because he doesn’t support legalizing marijuana. Martinez says he does support legalizing the drug, as long as the legislation “considers the impact it has on developing minds.”\xa0\n\xa0“The Martinez record won’t add up to a Democrat who represents us.”\xa0\n\nLast week, as polls revealed Martinez surging, the Haaland campaign sent up a signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the heading “New Mexico Voter Alert,” the campaign asked for outside groups to attack “Damon Martinez’s true record as former U.S. attorney\xa0— using racial profiling in sting operations while failing to prosecute policy brutality.” Women Vote!, EMILY’s List’s independent expenditure arm, responded with nearly $200,000 worth of television ads slamming Martinez for failing to prosecute police officers involved in deadly shootings in Albuquerque.\xa0\n“For Congress, the Martinez record won’t add up to a Democrat who represents us,” a gravel-voiced female narrator says.\xa0\nThe step of attacking a male candidate without endorsing a female contender is nearly unprecedented for EMILY’s List\xa0— the only other instance Democratic operatives can recall is in a 2014 Pennsylvania congressional race.\xa0\nFor his part, Martinez bristled when told the other candidates in the race view him as a moderate. He describes himself as a “progressive prosecutor,” and notes he eventually crafted a consent agreement reining in the Albuquerque police department. The shootings mentioned in the ad took place before his tenure as U.S. attorney began. He notes he can’t control which outside groups decided to spend cash on his behalf.\xa0\n“I would put my progressive record up against anybody’s,” Martinez said.\xa0\n“I really don’t think that our electoral system was designed for Native American women to hold positions of power.”\xa0\xa0\n\nWhile some trailblazing politicians prefer to downplay their “first-ever” status, Haaland’s campaign is not hiding from the historic aspects of her candidacy.\xa0\n“An opportunity to make history,” one of her mailers reads. “Deb Haaland would be the first Native American woman elected to the United States Congress.”\n“A lot of people recognize disparity in our elected offices,” Haaland said in an interview. “And when you stop to think about how women like me have never seen ourselves in our U.S. Congress, it makes them pause.”\nBut Haaland’s other major strength as a candidate may be more traditional. As a former state party chair and longtime activist, she’s been able to build ties to key interest groups. She has the endorsements of the National Educational Association, the American Federation of Teachers and Planned Parenthood, plus backing from high-profile national Democrats like former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Valerie Jarrett, a top aide to former President Barack Obama.\n“I’ve attended every single rally, every single protest,” Haaland said. “Everything they’ve ever asked me to come to, I show up. And a lot of people are voting for me because I show up.”\nBut those longtime ties haven’t turned into advertising dollars. While there are established groups backing both Latinos and veterans running for office, the Native American community doesn’t have the same political infrastructure. 7Gen Leaders\xa0— named after a Native American concept that your decisions impact the next seven generations\xa0— is new. So far it’s spent\xa0$175,000, far less than its counterparts backing Martinez and Sedillo Lopez.\nHaaland’s team is trying to turn the money gap to their advantage. “I really don’t think that our electoral system was designed for Native American woman to hold positions of power,” a script for volunteers making phone calls on her behalf reads. “Outside spending has poured into this race to stop Deb’s momentum and to stop her from making history.”\n“The first time someone asked me to run, I laughed.”\n\nSedillo Lopez’s story is typical of a Democrat in 2018. A woman who has never held office before is asked to run, and brushes it off.\xa0\n“The very first time someone asked me to run, I started laughing,” she said in an interview.\xa0\nBut that “someone” wasn’t just a friend. It was Lujan Grisham, the incumbent congresswoman and a former law student of Sedillo Lopez’s. At the time, Sedillo Lopez was running a nonprofit helping immigrant victims of domestic abuse and was winning attention for her work to keep ICE out of courthouses in the state. (While Lujan Grisham asked Sedillo Lopez to run, she is officially neutral in the race.)\nShe soon entered the race, and won the endorsement of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Latino Victory Fund, with both choosing to endorse her over Martinez out of a desire to see more Latinas in Congress. (There are just eight Hispanic women in Congress, compared to 24 men.) Latino Victory Fund has since spent $325,000 on television ads backing her.\xa0\nHer supporters bill her as a natural successor to Lujan Grisham, a spark plug congresswoman who has drawn national attention for sparring with the president, and they argue her background as a law professor makes her uniquely suited to battle an administration they believe is violating the Constitution on a near-daily basis.\n“Voters will ask me: What can we do about Trump?” Sedillo Lopez said. “Checks and balances aren’t a Constitutional issue, they’re a political one. And right now we have a Congress where Republicans are either complicit or they’re quitting, or in Paul Ryan’s case, both.”\xa0\nAs Sedillo Lopez walked around Albuquerque’s Civic Square during a weekday lunch hour, talking to voters buying burritos and crafts from local vendors, most seemed receptive to her pitch.\n“We need to see more women in there,” one craft vendor said as she took one of Sedillo Lopez’s last pieces of literature.\xa0\n",

  'body': "\nGun suicides declined significantly in two states after they passed laws allowing police to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals determined to be a threat to themselves or others, according to new research.\nA study published Friday in the journal Psychiatric Services examined years of death data following the passage of “red flag” laws in Connecticut, which became the first state to enact this sort of law in 1999, and Indiana, which followed suit in 2005.\nIn Indiana, the study found a 7.5 percent reduction in firearm suicides in the decade following the red flag law’s enactment. The link was less pronounced in Connecticut, at least initially. Gun suicides fell only 1.6 percent in the years after the law’s enactment, but enforcement of the law appeared to spike in 2007 following the mass shooting at Virginia Tech, leading to a 13.7 reduction in firearm suicides from 2007 to 2015.\nOne of the study’s authors says the research should give fuel to the state-led push for similar laws around the country, which advocates have held up as vital tools to prevent gun violence.\n“Our data shows that when red flag laws are utilized, they have the effect of preventing large numbers of suicides,” Aaron Kivisto, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at the University of Indianapolis, told HuffPost.\nTo measure the effect of red flag laws, researchers created a model using data from other states as well as from Connecticut and Indiana in the years before they implemented their laws. After controlling for other factors known to affect suicide, including rates of gun ownership, unemployment and alcohol consumption, they were able to extrapolate what the suicide rate would have been in Connecticut and Indiana without the laws. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“Our estimates here were between 300 and 400 gun suicides prevented in the 10 years after Indiana enacted its law, and a little over 100 in Connecticut,” said Kivisto.\n\n\n\n\nGleb Garanich / Reuters\n\n\nA new study finds there were declines in gun suicides in Connecticut and Indiana in the years following\xa0the states’ implementation of red flag laws.\n\n\n\nThese declines translated to a decrease in overall suicides in Indiana. In Connecticut, however, the lower number of firearm suicides was offset by an increased number of suicides by other means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed flag laws have emerged as one of the most popular legislative responses to the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed. The suspect in that shooting, a 19-year-old former student at the school, had attracted the attention of local police on numerous occasions before his attack, but officers had no authority to take his firearms. \nEight states now have red flag laws on the books, and Florida is among the four to have joined those ranks since the Parkland shooting. Other states are still considering legislation and appear poised to enact laws this session.\nMost of these measures allow for law enforcement, family members or roommates to petition for a red flag, also known as a gun violence restraining order, against an individual whom they believe to be dangerous. This initiates a court process that can lead to the temporary confiscation of that person’s firearms and an order that they remain away from all guns for a period of time.\nThe standards of evidence and investigation required to authorize that seizure vary somewhat by state. All of the state measures include some level of judicial oversight and due process, but some critics of red flag laws say firearms should never be taken unless the owner is found guilty of a crime.\nAlthough much of the current debate around red flag laws has revolved around their ability to disarm a potential mass murderer and give them time to cool off, Kivisto said that in states where these statutes have been in effect the longest, they’ve been used primarily on people who appear to pose a threat only to themselves.\n“Red flag laws tend to be introduced in response to oftentimes a mass homicide, but in practice what we realized is they are not used very often to seize guns from people thought to be at risk of homicide,” Kivisto said.\nData out of Indiana showed that in some years about 80 percent of all gun seizures under red flag laws involved a perceived risk of suicide, added Kivisto. Any link between the laws and other forms of gun violence, such as homicide or intimate partner homicide, likely wouldn’t have been strong.\nTrends in the use of red flag laws may reflect a lack of awareness among law enforcement or the public. Advocates for red flag laws in other states have expressed concerns that they’re not being sufficiently utilized, in part because there hasn’t been enough of a push to educate people on how and when to petition for someone’s firearms to be confiscated.\nWith red flag laws gaining broader acceptance across the country, often with bipartisan support from lawmakers and approval among both gun owners and non-gun owners, it’s possible that researchers will soon have enough data to begin measuring what effect they have on other types of shootings. Until then, Kivisto said, studies like his show that the measures are worth pursuing.\n“Policymakers should take advantage of the data available,” said Kivisto. “There isn’t a lot yet, but what we do have tends to suggest that these can make a positive difference.”\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the\xa0National\xa0Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Loudest Anti-Muslim Twitter Troll Is A Shady Vegan Married To An (Ousted) WWE Exec',
  'body': "\nShe was supposed to be a Russian bot. That seemed like the best explanation for @AmyMek. No normal person could be so prolific and prejudiced.\nFor five years, the mysterious Twitter account ― which has more than 200,000 followers, including Sean Hannity,\xa0Roseanne Barr\xa0and the personal account of\xa0Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and has earned endorsements from Donald Trump and Michael Flynn ― has tirelessly spewed far-right propaganda and, above all,\xa0Islamophobia. Around 25 tweets a day, sometimes more, the majority of them designed to stoke hatred of Muslims.\nTweets like this:\xa0\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nAnd this:\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nAnd thousands of others.\xa0The bigotry was garden-variety Islamophobia: memes about Sharia executions and child rape, genital mutilation and Muslims torturing and butchering various life forms while dusky columns of Saracens, every one of them a potential jihadist, march into Western lands bent on pillage. What made @AmyMek special was her industriousness. She never took a break.\n“She’s a major cog in the Islamophobia machine,” said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy and civil rights organization that @AmyMek often attacks.\nHer Twitter timeline was one long screed that reflected the collective id of the Make America Great Again movement. Tea party rage, evangelical hokum and white supremacy ― it was all there. In sufficient volume, this kind of hate can now turn any no-account right-winger into a star on social media. And it worked for @AmyMek.\nBut who was she?\nEven her Twitter bio, which features a grainy photo of a blond woman who claims to be a vegan, gun-loving psychotherapist and “fixer” fighting for the “wrongfully incarcerated,” felt janky. “[A]n ideological theme park map” is how Maureen Erwin, a political consultant who wrote about\xa0her search for @AmyMek\xa0last year, described it.\nThere is a real person, however, behind the bio. The headshot is real, if dated. And the Twitter handle, surprisingly, differs little from her actual name: Amy Jane Mekelburg.\nMekelburg, who declined multiple requests from HuffPost to comment, has managed to keep almost all of her personal information off the internet. The 45-year-old resident of Fishkill, New York, grew up in a Jewish family in East Brunswick, New Jersey, a fairly affluent community not far south of New York City. Her father owns a wholesale business called Mekelburg Co. that sells magnets, keychains and assorted gimcrackery. Her brother runs a popular restaurant and craft beer bar in Brooklyn that also bears the family name.\nAs a teenager, Mekelburg attended East Brunswick High School, where she stood out for her athletic ability and was a key member of the state championship soccer team. She graduated in 1991. East Brunswick High, according to one former classmate, was not a diverse school. “It was predominantly white with a large Jewish population,” the classmate said. He estimated that less than 1 percent of their nearly 500-person class were Muslim.\n\n\n\n\nEast Brunswick High School yearbook\n\n\n\nAfter high school, Mekelburg attended the University of Rhode Island and graduated in 1996 with a degree in communication studies. She started dating future husband Salvatore “Sal” Siino, who had also grown up in New Jersey and earned a cluster of fancy degrees, including an MBA from Harvard Business School. In 2003, Siino took a job in New York City. By then, he and Mekelburg were a couple. They moved to Manhattan’s Upper East Side.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was there that Mekelburg’s life took an unusual turn. In November 2005, only a few blocks from where Mekelburg and Siino lived, a young woman who worked as a stripper was\xa0stabbed to death in an apartment, her throat slashed so viciously that she was nearly decapitated. Police found a bloody fingerprint on the wall and arrested the victim’s on-and-off boyfriend, Paul Cortez, a handsome aspiring actor who worked as a personal trainer at a neighborhood gym. A jury found Cortez guilty of second-degree murder. In March 2007, he was\xa0sentenced to 25 years to life.\nMekelburg told Tina Galasso,\xa0a now-former friend, that she’d gotten to know Cortez before the murder and spent a lot of time with him. Mekelburg and Siino created a nonprofit organization dedicated to overturning Cortez’s conviction.\xa0She was the president. Siino was the moneyman. According to 2007 tax records, Siino donated more than $56,000 to hire Jeffrey Lichtman, a criminal defense attorney best known for keeping mobster John “Junior” Gotti out of prison. Lichtman was unable to win a new trial for Cortez.\nBut the convict still had Mekelburg, who was devoted to him. When Cortez started serving his sentence at the maximum-security Auburn Correctional Facility in upstate New York, Mekelburg told Galasso and another now-former friend that she moved into a hotel near the prison. She posted her first tweet during this time ― a picture of a McDonald’s restaurant in Auburn, New York, with a “ChildObesity” hashtag. Siino, meanwhile, moved to Los Angeles to\xa0launch a doomed internet media startup\xa0called WeMash with Quincy Jones III, son of the famous music producer.\nIn November 2015, Cortez was transferred downstate to the Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, New York. Mekelburg followed him. At the beginning of 2016, she moved to Fishkill, about a 15-minute drive from Green Haven. She and Siino by then owned a $1.2 million apartment in Greenwich Village, but she wanted to be close to Cortez. She called him her “best friend.” \nMekelburg told her new neighbors that she was a psychotherapist in the prison system, working to help inmates transition back to civilian life and overturn wrongful convictions. She said she had a private practice in Manhattan but had moved to Fishkill because her “clients” had been transferred to prisons throughout the Hudson Valley. She said Green Haven Correctional Facility paid her rent, but in reality, Siino took care of that.\nOfficials at the New York State Office of Mental Health, which oversees all mental health treatment in the prison system, and the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision told HuffPost that Mekelburg has never worked for them. She isn’t licensed as a psychotherapist or a social worker ― although she tricked Galasso and her then-boyfriend into doing counseling sessions with her, according to Galasso.\xa0HuffPost could find no evidence of Mekelburg ever holding a full-time job anywhere.\nBut she’s tweeted full time since 2013.\n“I haven’t seen any other account that is dedicated to hate 24-7 like this,” Maureen Erwin said.\nFrom the start, Mekelburg turned to racist far-right conspiracy and propaganda sites such as InfoWars and Gateway Pundit as sources. She bashed welfare and Obamacare and fast food workers striking for higher pay. She mocked liberals for supporting Trayvon Martin, the black teenager shot to death by George Zimmerman. She fearmongered about immigrant rape gangs and government gun grabs, often attaching hashtags such as #tcot (which stands for Top Conservatives On Twitter) and #PJNET (Patriot Journalist Network) that would soon be widely used by Kremlin-controlled troll accounts. Her main target was the “tyrant” Barack Obama, whom she branded an “illegal alien” and a “jihadist.” She tweeted that “Obama’s evil is limitless.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nMekelburg dropped some clues about herself on Twitter. She and Siino interacted in tweets during early 2013 but soon stopped replying to each other.\xa0And in July 2014,\xa0she posted a request for help in locating her cousin, who had gone missing in Pennsylvania. In local news stories about the missing woman,\xa0Mekelburg was quoted under her real name.\xa0Anyone paying attention to @AmyMek would have made the connection to “Amy Mekelburg.”\nIn 2014, she also started using neo-Nazi terms like “cultural Marxism” and borrowing propaganda from white supremacists like Kenn Gividen, who runs a racist website and at one point was the presidential candidate for the white nationalist American Freedom Party. She encouraged her readers to follow\xa0Jared Wyand, a white supremacist and anti-Semite\xa0who openly praises Adolf Hitler and denies the Holocaust happened.\nHate tends to run together, which is how an Islamophobic Jew can find common ground with white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Mekelburg removed a reference to her Jewish heritage in her Twitter bio. She’d later praise British fascist Jayda Fransen and ethnonationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has used anti-Semitism for political gain by casting the Hungarian-American Jewish billionaire George Soros as an evil, globalist puppet master. Mekelburg did the same on Twitter, often using clips from the Kremlin-controlled Russia Today to attack Soros:\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nMekelburg also swooned over racist figures such as former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopolous and YouTuber Stefan Molyneux and hyped white nationalist groups such as Soldiers of Odin, Proud Boys and Generation Identity. She vilified quarterback Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee, called Black Lives Matter a terrorist group and made light of police violence against black men. She tweeted\xa0white supremacist lies about black rape statistics:\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIslam brought out her worst. She labeled the Prophet Muhammad a “pedophile” and a “mentally sick conman.” She called Islam a “pervert cult” and mocked Muslims for “lifting their asses” to Allah. She wanted mosques banned in the United States and called herself a modern-day “crusader.” Over and over again, she tweeted about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating America and the imminent threat of Sharia law.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nWhen Trump announced his presidential candidacy in 2015 and sounded Islamophobic notes, Mekelburg immediately jumped on the MAGA train. Trump reciprocated by promoting her Twitter account. By the time she’d arrived in Fishkill in early 2016,\xa0Mekelburg had a sizable social media following. \nShe tweeted obsessively, sometimes not even looking up from her phone or her laptop when people spoke to her, according to residents of her apartment complex. The rest of her time she seemed to spend eating vegan food at local restaurants, exercising at Planet Fitness and visiting Cortez in prison.\nShe was nasty to Muslims she met in person and sometimes shot them dirty looks or insults.\xa0Galasso and the other former friend recall Mekelburg’s reaction when they encountered a Turkish woman in the Planet Fitness bathroom.\n“Amy was like, ‘Oh, it fucking smells in here. These people are disgusting,’”\xa0the second ex-friend said. “She could see the woman was in there. The bathroom didn’t smell.”\nIf a person who appeared to be of Middle Eastern descent used a piece of equipment at the gym before Mekelburg did, she’d “either clean it excessively, complain it was gross or refuse to use the machine,” Galasso said.\xa0“She was cruel in every form.”\xa0\nIn May 2016, Mekelburg achieved Twitter stardom when The New York Times featured @AmyMek\xa0in a column about Trump’s female supporters. The column quoted “Ms. Mek” making excuses for Trump’s misogyny. The writer, Emma Roller, had interviewed Mekelburg over Twitter, but failed to ascertain her identity or address her bigotry. Mekelburg told Roller that she was too busy for a phone interview, according to emails between Roller and Maureen Erwin. Later, Mekelburg gloated to her neighbors about her media appearance, pointing to the story on her computer. (She’d doxed herself again.)\nHer follower count surged. She was getting thousands of retweets. As the election approached, Mekelburg used her Twitter celebrity to attack Hillary Clinton. She accused Clinton of conspiring with the Justice Department and having Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich murdered in a political cover-up. Perhaps incidentally, she helped\xa0boost Kremlin efforts to get a fake Benghazi quote trending in order to damage the Democratic candidate. In the hallway of her apartment complex, Mekelburg hung a Clinton bobblehead doll in a noose.\nAfter Trump’s win, Mekelburg celebrated on Twitter, but not for long. She had more hate and lies to amplify. She tweeted that anti-fascists were responsible for train derailments and that the DNC and the media caused the death of protester Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia. Not once did she criticize Trump’s racist and fascist supporters. Instead, she scapegoated Muslims for mass shootings carried out by white supremacists and far-right gun nuts such as\xa0Stephen Paddock, who massacred 58 people in Las Vegas\xa0last year.\xa0Mekelburg used Islamic State propaganda to support her own:\xa0\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nMekelburg had also been trying to make inroads into what Ibrahim Hooper calls “the cottage-industry of Islam haters,” which is run by bigots such as Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer, David Horowitz, Brigitte Gabriel and Frank Gaffney — several of whom have close ties to the Republican establishment and the Trump administration. Their efforts can be remunerative, thanks to generous funding from conservative and libertarian foundations such as the Donors Capital Fund.\nMekelburg’s best connection to this world was through Anni Cyrus, who produces The Glazov Gang, an Islamophobic talk show that can be found on YouTube. Host Jamie Glazov is the editor of one of Horowitz’s anti-Muslim publications. Mekelburg asked for Cyrus’ help in launching her own anti-Muslim organization. Cyrus, who did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment,\xa0greeted Mekelburg’s overture with enthusiasm. \n“It’s such a privilege to hear from you as I follow your amazing work daily,” Cyrus emailed. “Thank you so much for considering me for this project. It will be an honor to be able to work with you on this.”\nMekelburg named her organization Resistance Against Islamic Radicals (RAIR). She created a website, set up a Facebook page and a Twitter handle, and recruited Cortez to design artwork from behind bars, according to Galasso. RAIR’s mission would be “to stop the Jihadi infiltration in our American communities.” Mekelburg didn’t mention herself anywhere on the organization’s website. Under an “accomplices” section, however, she posted the names, photos and contact information for people and groups she believed were collaborating with jihadi terrorists. That could mean anyone with a connection to Islam.\n“If the local garbage man was seen going into a mosque, you could submit that information to the site and she would post it,” said Galasso.\nSoliciting denunciations from members of the public had a Gestapo-Stasi stink to it, and RAIR’s roster of “accomplices” included city council members, rabbis, police chiefs, mosques, newspapers and other businesses. It looked like a target list. (During the reporting of this story, the contact information for the “accomplices” was removed from the RAIR website.)\nJanet Lyness, the county attorney in Johnson County, Iowa, made the list because she donated to the campaign of Mazahir Salih, a Muslim woman who became the first Sudanese-American elected to public office in the United States\xa0when she won a city council seat in Iowa City last year.\n\n\n\n\nRAIR\n\n\n\nLyness, who is the chief law enforcement officer for Johnson County, didn’t realize Mekelburg had targeted her until she was contacted by HuffPost.\xa0\n“It concerned me seeing this, accusing me and all these other people of being jihadists,” Lyness said. “While it’s ridiculous, and everything she’s saying is false and ludicrous, I do wonder who might be reading this and might follow up and want to contact or threaten anyone on this list.”\nMekelburg had plenty of warning signs that her hate-slinging might have consequences. “My dads bugging out,” she texted last year, around the time she was working on RAIR. “He calls me every day bugging out. … His business is in a Muslim hotbed and my brothers restaurant has the same name. World Trade Center muslim terrorists mosque is down the street.”\nMekelburg’s Islamophobia also put Siino in an awkward position.\xa0In February 2017, after his startup went out of business following a trademark dispute, Siino found a new job with the WWE, the Connecticut-based pro wrestling entertainment company co-founded by Linda McMahon, who now works in the Trump administration.\xa0Siino, who did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment, became a senior vice president responsible for global content distribution and business development. Mekelburg told Galasso that the WWE knew about @AmyMek and had asked Siino to keep his connection to his wife quiet.\nWhen asked by HuffPost about the veracity of this claim, the WWE at first offered a cryptic answer. “This is the first time we’re hearing about Amy Mekelburg,” said a corporate spokesperson last Thursday, requesting not to be identified by name.\nThe company had reason to worry about Mekelburg’s Islamophobia. In the early part of 2018, the WWE and Saudi Arabia finalized a controversial 10-year deal to bring pro wrestling there. Siino was negotiating TV deals in the United Arab Emirates, according to the WWE. Back in Fishkill, his wife was casting Muslims as subhuman filth.\nTwitter’s policy against hateful conduct prohibits “behavior that incites fear about a protected group” and “repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone.” One digital sleuth who tracks @AmyMek told HuffPost that he has reported the account to Twitter more than 50 times to no avail. Although the company has “withheld” Mekelburg’s account in Germany and France,\xa0Twitter has done little to cramp her style in the U.S.\nMekelburg appeared to operate without fear of fallout anywhere. As this story neared publication, she kept tweeting hate, even when her husband’s job was in jeopardy.\xa0Last Friday, after HuffPost asked the WWE a second time if anyone there had known about @AmyMek before hiring Siino, the company responded definitively.\n“No,” said the WWE spokesperson. “Now that it has come to our attention, Sal Siino is no longer an employee.”\nSiino showed up at the Fishkill apartment complex over Memorial Day weekend, dry-cleaned shirts hanging in the back of his Audi A5. On Tuesday, he was still there. And Mekelburg was still tweeting. She raved about “jihadi rape gangs” and threw her support behind Tommy Robinson, a far-right, anti-Muslim, violent British criminal who was arrested last week for contempt of court after livestreaming about “Muslim paedophiles” outside a gang rape trial in Leeds, England. She defended Roseanne Barr after Barr tweeted racist and Islamophobic comments and anti-Semitic lies.\nClearly, Mekelburg wasn’t going to stop.\nOn Wednesday, she emailed this HuffPost reporter ― not to answer questions or address or clarify any of the information I’d gathered about her. She wanted to muscle me.\xa0“My attorney, Martin Garbus (cc’ed on this email), will contact you tomorrow morning,” she wrote.\nMartin Garbus is a high-profile attorney who has represented Daniel Ellsberg, Nelson Mandela and Don Imus, among many others.\xa0Two of his current clients, Paul and Chris Gaubatz, are major Islamophobes. When Garbus did not call me at the designated time Thursday morning, I called him.\n“I don’t represent that woman,”\xa0he told me and then hung up the phone.\nBut that wasn’t the end for Mekelburg. She posted a long thread on Twitter blaming me for the WWE’s decision to fire Siino over her bigotry. Within minutes, her followers began calling me with threats.\n“You better be careful because people are out there targeting you now,” one said.\n“You’re going to get it now,” said another.\nWhite nationalists, misogynists and neo-Nazis all amplified Mekelburg’s comments about me.\xa0So did prominent far-right propagandists such as Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich, both of whom had been instrumental in driving the near-deadly “PizzaGate” disinformation campaign.\nUnfortunately, hate\xa0that festers online against any group of people doesn’t always stay online. Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 after radicalizing himself with the same anti-Muslim propaganda that Mekelburg spreads. In the U.S., assaults and hate crimes against Muslims have risen alarmingly\xa0since MAGA xenophobes mustered on social media.\nAnd hate isn’t always so explosive. It often manifests as a quiet cruelty. Last year, according to Mekelburg’s other former friend,\xa0the Twitter troll stopped at a Sunoco in Fishkill to buy bananas at the gas station’s convenience store. Inside, she found an older man ― a Muslim immigrant ― working behind the counter. Mekelburg paid for her bananas but refused to speak to the man. She wouldn’t look at him. She just threw a few bills on the counter. When the man tried to place some change in her hand, she made it clear to him that he was not to touch her.\nThen she went home to tweet.\n",

 {'title': 'Listen To Michael Cohen Threaten A Reporter Over Donald Trump Story',
  'body': "\nA vitriolic audiotape of a phone call between Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen and a reporter reveals how the lawyer tried to protect his boss with threats and fury. “What I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting,” Cohen tells the journalist in a rage on the tape aired for the first time Thursday by National Public Radio.\nThe phone call offers a fascinating glimpse into the way a bristling Cohen dealt with people to get them to back off Trump, establishing his reputation as a “fixer.”\nFormer Trump political adviser Sam Nunberg said that Trump himself set the aggressive tone he expected Cohen to take. Cohen “was supposed to say and act the way Donald wanted him to act,” Nunberg added. “Michael had even expressed sometimes regret that he did certain things — because it was at the direction of Donald.”\nThe phone call involved then-Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak, who wrote the NPR story and provided a tape of his conversation with Cohen. He had reached out to former Trump aide Hope Hicks in 2015 for a response to claims made by Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, in a 1993 deposition during divorce proceedings that her husband had once raped her. Ivana Trump confirmed that she used the word “rape” but later clarified that she didn’t mean rape in a “literal or criminal sense.” (After the Beast story appeared, she said the story was “without merit” and that “Donald and I are now the best of friends.”)\nMak heard back from Cohen, who first told the reporter, falsely, that by “definition you can’t rape your spouse.” In fact, marital rape is a crime in all 50 states\xa0and has been illegal in New York since 1984 (Ivana claimed she was attacked in 1989).\n\nCohen then became increasingly heated — and threatening.\n\n\n“Mark my words ... I will make sure that you and I meet one day over in the courthouse, and I will take you for every penny you still don’t have, and I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know,” Cohen said. “Do not even think about going to where I know you’re planning on going. And that’s my warning for the day.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “Tread very fucking lightly because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. Do you understand me? Don’t think you can hide behind your pen because it’s not going to happen. I’m more than happy to discuss it with your attorney ... because, motherfucker, you’re going to need it.”\nThen he suggested: “I think you should go ahead and write the story that you plan on writing; I think you should do it because I think you’re an idiot, all right, and I think your paper is a joke. And it’s going to be my absolute pleasure to serve you with a $500 million lawsuit.”\n\nMak wrote the story and Cohen never sued. But Nunberg told NPR there were calls among Trump campaign aides for Cohen’s resignation after that because of the way he dealt with the situation. Cohen later apologized for his false claims that spousal rape is not illegal.\nTrump also distanced himself from Cohen’s claim about spousal rape, saying: “He’s speaking for himself. He’s not speaking for me, obviously.”\nEarlier this month satirical stalwart The Onion printed a threatening email from Cohen in 2013 over a parody article with Donald Trump’s byline headlined: “When You’re Feeling Low, Just Remember I’ll Be Dead in About 15 or 20 Years.” Cohen responded: “The article is an absolutely disgusting piece that lacks any place in journalism, even in your Onion.”\n",

 {'title': 'Chelsea Clinton Points To Right-Wing Hypocrisy In Samantha Bee Outrage',
  'body': '\n“Feckless cunt,” the fiery insult that comedian Samantha Bee flung at first daughter Ivanka Trump on Wednesday night,\xa0rankled many conservatives\xa0who said Bee crossed a line.\xa0\nThe White House said\xa0her show,\xa0“Full Frontal,” was not “fit for broadcast.” President\xa0Donald Trump demanded to know\xa0on Friday why TBS would not fire Bee. But at least one observer saw hypocrisy in all the backlash.\xa0\nOliver Willis, a writer at the progressive news site Shareblue, unearthed a 1994 interview in which musician Ted Nugent used the same c-word to refer to then-first lady Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show how Nugent’s offensive language has done nothing to impact his standing with Republicans,\xa0Willis tweeted a recent photo of Nugent shaking hands with Trump alongside the 24-year-old quote.

 {'title': 'ICE Deports Uncle Of Kids Recently Orphaned After Parents Died Fleeing Immigration Officers',
  'body': "\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement detained and quickly deported an undocumented man on Wednesday, leaving behind his four children as well as his six nieces and nephews who were recently orphaned when their parents got into a car crash fleeing ICE. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe arrest of Celestino Hilario Garcia, 33, was the type of ICE action that takes place every day. He has a criminal record for driving under the influence and was previously deported to his native Mexico. It was clear that ICE already had had him in its sights. When ICE agents went to an apartment complex in Delano, California, in mid-March, they were looking for him. \nBut given what happened next that day, Hilario Garcia’s wife and local advocates condemned ICE’s decision to move forward with his removal. \nOn March 13, ICE agents went looking for Hilario Garcia and instead followed another man who fit his description: his brother, 35-year-old Santos Hilario Garcia, who was in the car with his wife, 33-year-old Marcelina Garcia Profecto. The two sped to get away from ICE, then veered off the road and crashed their car. Both of them died at the scene.\n“We’re still not recovered from the loss, and now they separate us,” said Celestino Hilario Garcia’s wife, who requested anonymity because she fears for her safety, in an interview in Spanish.\xa0\nThe immigrant and farmworker communities in the majority-Latino city were outraged after the deaths, accusing ICE under President Donald Trump of being overly aggressive in following the couple. Some residents said they were afraid of leaving their homes after what happened. \nOn Wednesday morning, Celestino Hilario Garcia had just gotten into his car to go to work when ICE agents arrived and yelled at him to put his hands up, his wife said. She and her youngest child, a 4-year-old girl, watched it happen while the other children were still asleep, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the day, ICE had deported Hilario Garcia back to Mexico. His wife said he decided not to fight his removal because it could lead to his being locked up for years while the case played out — something he felt he could not do. He told her he didn’t feel like a criminal and just wanted to give a better life to his kids, she said. \n“It’s not fair that this happened ― first to my brother-in-law and now what they did to my husband,” she said.\nSantos Hilario Garcia and Garcia Profecto left behind six children, who range in age from 9 to 18 years old. Celestino Hilario Garcia’s wife said the children are very close with her family.\xa0\n“Yesterday when I spoke to them, they started to cry,” she said, herself in tears.\n“I have no idea how my life will be from now on,” she added. “How to help my kids get by. Right now I’m the only one, also caring for my nieces and nephews.”\xa0\nAn ICE spokesperson confirmed that deportation officers from ICE’s Fugitive Operation Team arrested Celestino Hilario Garcia on Wednesday. ICE previously granted him voluntary return to Mexico ― an alternative to deportation ― seven times from 2002 to 2009, at which point an immigration judge ordered his removal, and he was deported, the spokesperson said. After re-entering the U.S., he was deported a second time a month later, according to ICE, which also said he has three criminal convictions for driving under the influence.\nHis wife said those convictions took place in 2011 and 2012. \nAfter Santos Hilario Garcia and Garcia Profecto died, ICE blamed California’s so-called sanctuary policies limiting police cooperation with deportation efforts, saying the state’s laws lead to more enforcement conducted in communities and arrests of people who were not initially their targets. \nThe United Farm Workers Foundation, which has been active in advocating for immigrants’ rights, condemned Celestino Hilario Garcia’s deportation as a new blow to the farmworker community. \n“Can ICE be more callous in visiting even greater anguish upon this family that has already suffered so much?” United Farm Workers Foundation Executive Director Diana Tellefson Torres said in a statement on Thursday. “How much crueler can Donald Trump’s immigration policies become?”\n",

The president’s legal team said in July 2017 that he had no involvement in drafting the statement.\nInconsistent explanations about the president’s involvement in Trump Jr.’s statement could potentially be seen as obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n“Mr. Leader, are you bothered by the fact that the White House lied about the president’s involvement here?” Bash asked McCarthy during CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.\nMcCarthy hesitated, but then bashed Mueller’s investigation.\n“Look, the one thing I have found, this has gone on for more than a year,” McCarthy said about the Russia probe. “Millions of dollars has been spent. The White House has been cooperating all the way through.”\nMcCarthy continued to question Mueller’s investigation until Bash confronted him for parroting “talking points,”\xa0asking him again whether he’s concerned that the White House “lied.”\nBut McCarthy deflected once again.\n“What I was concerned most about, like most Americans, was there any collusion? There was no collusion,”\xa0he said, continuing: “What I’m really concerned about is, look at what our economic numbers are, look at North Korea’s meeting going through, look at the trade discussions we’re having, and this is the No. 1 question we’re following through?”\nBash called out McCarthy for refusing to “answer the question about the lies” before moving on to another topic.\nWatch the full interview below:\n\n',

I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left,” he added.\nGrenell praised Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who has been called the new face of European right-wing populism\xa0for his stance against immigration and refugee migration, as a\xa0“rockstar.”\nIt’s unclear if Grenell’s statements were approved by the State Department. Diplomats are traditionally expected to maintain their political neutrality and not interfere in the internal affairs of other nations.\nGrenell’s comments\xa0caused a stir in Germany, where several current and former officials from the Social Democratic Party, one of the parties that make up the government’s ruling coalition, criticized him for meddling in European politics.\n“Grenell does not behave like a diplomat but like a far-right colonial officer,” said former SPD leader Martin Schulz, according to\xa0HuffPost Germany. “Ambassadors are representatives of their countries and not of political movements.”\nSPD Vice President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel tweeted that “Europe’s citizens do not let a Trump vassal tell them how to vote.”\n“A US ambassador who meddles in democratic conflict is simply out of place,” he added.\nAnd Johannes Kahrs, another SPD official, said that if Grenell’s comments were aimed at ousting German Chancellor Angela Merkel ― a favorite target of Trump’s ― then “this gentleman has to leave the country.”\nBack in the United States, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.),\xa0a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\xa0called Grenell’s comments “awful” and criticized him for overstepping the boundaries ambassadors are supposed to set for themselves.\n\n\n\nTom Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, tweeted that Grenell had created a “huge headache” for top State Department officials. Wright also speculated that the envoy’s comments would heighten tensions within the Trump administration between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton.\nGrenell, a Republican and outspoken Trump ally, worked with Bolton when the latter served as the ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush.\nHe won Senate confirmation to his ambassador’s post in April by a 56-42 vote, despite criticism from Democrats about his “misogynistic and other incendiary statements online” ― particularly toward women in the media.\nThe story has been updated with comment from officials in Germany’s Social Democratic Party.\n',

  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump doesn’t intend to pardon himself,\xa0Rudy Giuliani said on Sunday ― but he “probably does” have the power to do so.\n“He has no intention of pardoning himself ... not to say he can’t,” Giuliani, a lawyer and adviser to Trump on the Russia probe, told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. He characterized the question of a self-pardon as a\xa0“really interesting constitutional argument.”\n“I think the political ramifications of that would be tough,” he said. “Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another.”\n\n\n\nIn another Sunday interview, this one on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Giuliani took a stronger stand on both the unlikeliness of such a move, and the possibility for political fallout.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s not going to happen,” he said, arguing that Trump had done nothing wrong that would require him to pardon himself.\nHe added that “the president of the United States pardoning himself is unthinkable... it would probably lead to immediate impeachment.”\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also weighed in against the idea. “I don’t think a president should pardon themselves,” he said on\xa0CNN’s\xa0“State of the Union.”\nPreet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump, said on the same program that the idea of the president deciding to pardon himself as “almost self-executing impeachment.”\nGiuliani said on “Meet The Press” that Trump\xa0has the power to terminate any federal investigation, although he described such a move as “a very unrealistic thing.”\n“The Department of Justice is a creature of the president,” he said. “I know based on presidential rulings... [the] Justice Department is given a certain amount of independence. I am tremendously in favor of it, but that’s all the president’s decision.”\nThe president’s lawyer defended Trump’s shifting explanations about a\xa0meeting with Russians at Trump Tower\xa0during the 2016 campaign that included his son, Donald Trump Jr. “This is the reason you don’t let the president testify” as part of the special counsel probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Giuliani told ABC. “Our recollection keeps changing, or we’re not even asked a question and somebody makes an assumption.”\xa0\nHe predicted that special counsel Robert Mueller would wrap up his investigation by the start of this September.\xa0“He’s as sensitive as everybody to not doing another Comey and interfering horribly in the election,” Giuliani said.\n\n\n\nHe was referring to then-FBI Director’s Jim Comey announcement less than two weeks before the 2016 vote that the agency was reopening aspects of its probe into Democratic candidate’s Hillary Clinton’s private use of email when she served as secretary of state. Although days later Comey said the probe was again being closed without charges being filed, Clinton has blamed his initial announcement as a key reason Trump went on to defeat her.\n',

 {'title': 'Democrats Are Blaming A Big-Spending Candidate For A Potential Disaster In California',
  'body': "\nNational operatives are increasingly worried no Democrat will advance to the general election in a key U.S. House district in Southern California, blaming a self-funding candidate’s attacks on other Democrats for a potential disaster that could harm the party’s chances of winning the U.S. House.\xa0\nDemocratic operatives are pointing fingers at Paul Kerr, a Navy veteran and businessman, ahead of the primary vote on Tuesday. Kerr has spent over $5 million of his own money on the race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa in San Diego County. Despite the heavy spending, he was running fourth among Democrats in two polls of the district released this week, one from the San Diego Union-Tribune and the other from the Democratic firm Tulchin Research.\xa0\nThe problem comes from California’s top-two primary system, where the two leading vote getters in the primary advance to the general election regardless of which party they belong to. While Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the 49th District by 7 percentage points in 2016, national operatives now fear a four-way split of Democratic votes could lead to two Republicans advancing to the general election.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two additional districts where Democrats fear they could be blocked from the November ballot\xa0― the adjacent 48th District, represented by pro-Russia Republican Dana Rohrabacher, and the nearby 39th District, where GOP Rep. Ed Royce is retiring. All three districts are considered toss-ups in November.\nThe preemptive finger pointing shows how afraid Democrats are of blowing a competitive race in a year where the battle for control of the House is expected to be razor-thin, and how intense the resulting infighting will be if Democrats are locked out in November.\xa0\nDemocrats are blaming Kerr because he’s paying for direct mail and television ads attacking another Democratic candidate, environmental lawyer Mike Levin, as a stooge for ExxonMobil and Countrywide Financial\xa0― two companies that are widely loathed by the party’s base.\xa0\n\n“Mike Levin profits,” the narrator says in the TV spot released Friday.\xa0“We pay the price.”\xa0\nDemocrats fear the attacks on Levin ― and on Sara Jacobs, a former Clinton campaign aide backed by EMILY’s List ― will divide the Democratic vote and allow two Republicans, state tax board member Diane Harkey and Assemblyman Rocky Chavez, to qualify for the ballot in November.\xa0Kerr is the only Democrat to air ads attacking another Democrat.\xa0\xa0\n“The top-two system is extremely complicated and calls for creative tactics, but for the lowest-performing Democrat to not only refuse to drop out of the race, but actually attack one of the top-performing Democrats on television is really disturbing and destructive,” said one national Democratic operative working on House races. “Paul Kerr’s actions could lead to Democrats being boxed out of the 49th.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ted Lieu, who represents a different Southern California district, called for Kerr to take down the negative ads.\n\n\n\nKerr’s campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. But he sent out a Twitter missive on Friday alleging Levin was the favored candidate of Democratic insiders.\nKerr has pitched himself as the candidate who can best relate to families in the district\xa0― while he’s now wealthy, he grew up in a working-class family and worked his way through college in his late 20s and early 30s. Jacobs, meanwhile, has benefited from more than $1 million in donations from her grandfather\xa0― Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs\xa0― to a super PAC backing her.\xa0\n\n\n\nHis campaign has also sent mailers attacking Jacobs for inflating her resume and alleging she disrespected veterans.\xa0\nLevin was actually the first candidate to go negative, with mailers attacking retired Marine Col. Doug Applegate, who narrowly lost to Issa in 2016. While Levin has the endorsement of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of progressive groups in California have questioned his credentials.\xa0\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune poll, conducted by SurveyUSA, found Harkey polling at 24 percent, followed by Applegate and Jacobs at 11 percent apiece, Levin at 10 percent, and Kerr and Chavez at 8 percent.\nThe Tulchin Research poll found Levin in the lead at 17 percent, followed by Harkey at 15 percent, Applegate at 12 percent, and Chavez and Jacobs tied at 11 percent. Kerr was polling at 7 percent.\nThe 49th District was one of Democrats’ earliest targets this cycle, with local activists hosting regular protests outside Issa’s office and eventually driving him into retirement.\xa0\nEllen Montanari, one of the activists who led the protests, said she and others were disappointed Kerr hadn’t dropped out.\n“Most of us in the district are really upset he’s stayed in the race,” said Montanari, who recently endorsed Levin. “He’s spending millions and he’s still in single digits. He just won’t let go.”\xa0\n“He would’ve been a hero if he dropped out,” she added.\xa0\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and House Majority PAC, which is run by allies of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, have spent heavily attacking Chavez in an effort to avoid a lockout. Their goal is to consolidate Republicans around Harkey, who is considered a lock to make the runoff, and make it easier for Jacobs or Levin to advance to the general election.\nThis story has been updated with additional information about Levin and the latest polls.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Kerr was in the U.S. Marines and Applegate was in the Army. Kerr was in the Navy and Applegate was in the Marines.\n",

But the initial focus of the meeting was Clinton, Trump’s son said last year.\nThe president’s letter on the meeting could cause him problems if it’s seen as an attempt to obstruct Mueller’s investigation into possible Russia collusion with his campaign.\nIt could also cause problems for Trump’s son, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last September\xa0that he didn’t have a clear idea who was responsible for the misleading statement about the meeting being focused on the adoption issue.\nTrump’s authorship of the problematic response — confirmed for the first time by his own attorneys — was an intriguing aside in the letter in which the key point was that he is essentially legally untouchable because he is the president. He can’t be compelled to testify\xa0in the Mueller investigation, and has the power to shut down any Justice Department probe and pardon whomever he wants, according to the letter.\n“Indeed, the President not only has unfettered statutory and Constitutional authority to terminate the FBI director,” the letter states, “he also has Constitutional authority to direct the Justice Department to open or close an investigation, and, of course, the power to pardon any person before, during, or after an investigation and/or conviction.”\nIt’s a position that legal experts have already attacked (check out the video above).\n\n\nTrump was angry the letter was leaked.\n\n\nCORRECTION:\xa0A previous version of this story indicated the Magnitsky Act dealt with Russian adoptions. In fact, the act imposed U.S. sanctions on Russian officials, and Russia responded with a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children.\n',

Negotiations between Trump’s lawyers and the special counsel on a possible interview have continued ever since.\nAs part of his investigation, Mueller is looking into the possibility the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow and that Trump subsequently tried to obstruct the probe.\nRussia has denied any interference and Trump has repeatedly said there was no collusion or obstruction of justice.\nGiuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMueller’s office declined to comment, while the White House and the two attorneys who wrote the letter - Sekulow and Dowd - did not reply to requests for comment. Dowd left the president’s legal team in March.\nGiuliani said last month that he wanted any interview of Trump to be limited in scope and length, suggesting it to be only 2-1/2 hours and not under oath.\nIf the president does not consent to an interview with the special counsel and Mueller does subpoena him, the interpretation by Trump’s lawyers of broad executive powers would likely be tested in court if they decided to fight the subpoena.\nIn arguing that Trump has the power to end an investigation or pardon people, his lawyers left open the possibility that they were referring only to a probe into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and not necessarily an investigation of the president, the Times said.\nIn an earlier tweet, Trump took what appeared to be a pre-emptive swipe at the Times report shortly before it ran that questioned whether Mueller’s office or the Justice Department leaked letters from his lawyers.\n“When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end?” Trump tweeted earlier on Saturday.\n\xa0(Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Mike Stone and Karen Frefield; editing by Tim Ahmann, Daniel Wallis and G Crosse)\n',

 {'title': 'U.N. Expert: America’s Poor Becoming More Destitute Under Trump',
  'body': '\nGENEVA (Reuters) - Poverty in the United States is extensive and deepening under the Trump administration whose policies seem aimed at removing the safety net from millions of poor people, while rewarding the rich, a U.N. human rights investigator has found.\nPhilip Alston, U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty, called on U.S. authorities to provide solid social protection and address underlying problems, rather than “punishing and imprisoning the poor”.\nWhile welfare benefits and access to health insurance are being slashed, President Donald Trump’s tax reform has awarded “financial windfalls” to the mega-rich and large companies, further increasing inequality, he said in a report.\nU.S. policies since President Lyndon Johnson’s war on poverty in the 1960s have been “neglectful at best,” he said.\n“But the policies pursued over the past year seem deliberately designed to remove basic protections from the poorest, punish those who are not in employment and make even basic health care into a privilege to be earned rather than a right of citizenship,” Alston said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 41 million people or 12.7 percent live in poverty, 18.5 million in extreme poverty, and children account for one in three poor, he said. The United States has the highest youth poverty rate among industrialized countries, he added.\n“Its citizens live shorter and sicker lives compared to those living in all other rich democracies, eradicable tropical diseases are increasingly prevalent and it has the world’s highest incarceration rate ... and the highest obesity levels in the developed world,” Alston said.\nHowever, the data from the U.S. Census Bureau he cited covers only the period through 2016, and he gave no comparative figures on the extent of poverty before and after Trump came into office in January 2017.\nThe Australian, a veteran U.N. rights expert and New York University law professor, will present his report to the United Nations Human Rights Council later this month.\nIt is based on his mission in December to several U.S. states, including rural Alabama, a slum in downtown Los Angeles, California, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.\nA U.S. official in Geneva, asked for comment, told Reuters: “The Trump Administration has made it a priority to provide economic opportunity for all Americans.”\n\xa0“SHAMEFUL STATISTICS”\nCiting “shameful statistics” linked to entrenched racial discrimination, Alston said that African Americans are 2.5 times more likely than whites to live in poverty and their unemployment rate is more than double. Women, Hispanics, immigrants, and indigenous people also suffer high rates.\nAt least 550,000 people are homeless in America, he said.\n“The tax reform will worsen this situation and ensure that the United States remains the most unequal society in the developed world,” Alston said. “The planned dramatic cuts in welfare will essentially shred crucial dimensions of a safety net that is already full of holes.”\nThe tax overhaul, which sailed through the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December, permanently cut the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Tax cuts for individuals, however, are temporary and expire after 2025.\nTrump has said they will lead to more take-home pay for workers and has touted bonuses some workers received from their employers as evidence the law is working.\nAlston dismissed allegations of widespread fraud in the welfare system and criticized the U.S. criminal justice system. It sets large bail bonds for a defendant seeking to go free pending trial, meaning wealthy suspects can afford bail while the poor remain in custody, often losing their jobs, he said.\n“There is no magic recipe for eliminating extreme poverty and each level of government must make its own good-faith decisions. At the end of the day, however, particularly in a rich country like the United States, the persistence of extreme poverty is a political choice made by those in power,” he said.\n(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by David Stamp and Andrew Bolton)\n',

 {'title': 'Trump’s Lawyers Argue It’s Not Possible For The President To Obstruct Justice',
  'body': '\nLawyers for President Donald Trump have argued for months that because he is president, it is not possible for their client to have obstructed special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to a confidential letter sent to Mueller and\xa0obtained by The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawyers stated that Trump also cannot be compelled to testify in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, arguing that Muller has everything he needs in the “voluminous testimony and documentation” already provided.\nUsing a broad interpretation of executive power outlined in the Constitution, the 20-page letter suggests Trump’s team intends to resist questioning by Mueller, should the special counsel try to force the president to answer questions by issuing a subpoena. Mueller has already\xa0raised the possibility\xa0with Trump’s lawyers, according to The Washington Post.\nABC News reporter Tara Palermi said Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor now working on Trump’s team, confirmed that the letter published by the Times still represents their legal strategy. Should Mueller issue a subpoena, Giuliani said, “we’re going to court.”\xa0\nTwo of Trump’s lawyers at the time, John Dowd and Jay Sekulow, authored the letter in January and delivered it by hand. (Dowd resigned in March.)\nThe question of whether the president will testify has been scrutinized for months. Mueller reportedly wishes to inquire about a number of topics, including Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey and his campaign’s possible coordination with Russia.\nTrump’s lawyers also suggested that the president could shut down any Justice Department investigation if he wanted to, although it is not clear whether they were referring to Mueller’s investigation.\n“Indeed, the President not only has unfettered statutory and Constitutional authority to terminate the FBI Director,” the letter reads, “he also has Constitutional authority to direct the Justice Department to open or close an investigation, and, of course, the power to pardon any person before, during, or after an investigation and/or conviction.”\nThe Times notes that Dowd and Sekulow may be claiming ― through ambiguous wording ―\xa0that Trump has the ability to pardon himself. The legality of such a move is not clear.\nTrump addressed the letter in a tweet by once again stating, “There was No Collusion with Russia.”\n“Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media?” he asked.\xa0\n\n\n\nTrump said in early May\xa0that he would “love to” speak with Mueller “because we’ve done nothing wrong,” but said his lawyers were advising him not to do so.\nGiuliani\xa0said weeks later that he doesn’t want Trump to speak to Mueller because there’s nothing to be gained.\nMueller’s Russia investigation has so far led to five guilty pleas involving three former Trump campaign staffers.\xa0More than a dozen others have also been indicted, including 13 Russian nationals, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and a Russian “troll farm” that allegedly spread propaganda to help Trump win.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump: Mueller Should Never Have Been Appointed!\n\n\n\n\n\nMueller Reportedly Investigating Ukraine Payment To Trump Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Robert Mueller Reportedly Wants To Ask Donald Trump\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Gavin Newsom Is Helping His Republican Rival. Now Other Democrats Are Crying Foul.',
  'body': "\nGavin Newsom is doing something odd.\nCalifornia’s lieutenant governor, the Democratic front-runner in this year’s race for governor,\xa0looks like he’s trying to help GOP rival John Cox by trumpeting Cox’s endorsement from President Donald Trump.\nNewsom, and a\xa0pro-Newsom super PAC, have blanketed the airwaves with attacks against Republican John Cox that would sound an awful lot like an endorsement if a Republican campaign were airing them.\n“John Cox stands with Donald Trump and the NRA,” the narrator in\xa0Newsom’s 30-second ad\xa0intones.\nHelping out a Republican in Tuesday’s nonpartisan primary may seem counterintuitive, but it’s the result of the Golden State’s “top two” system for picking who will be on the ballot in November.\xa0The top two performers on Tuesday will proceed to the general election\xa0― regardless of the party they belong to.\nWhile the move may help Newsom in the general election, some Democrats in California say he risks hurting the prospects of fellow party members in other races\xa0― and that could be a dangerous game as the national party looks to California in its quest to retake the U.S. House of Representatives.\n“He’s just going to screw everybody below him,” said Natalie Higley, northern vice chair of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus and a supporter of long-shot left-wing candidate Delaine Eastin, a former public schools chief in the state. “It’s almost like he’s completely forgotten what it’s like to be in a smaller race.”\nNewsom seems to be going all in with this gambit.\nWhile his campaign would not reveal the size of its ad buys when asked, the ad has aired statewide across California’s expensive media markets for over a month. That means it has surely cost the deep-coffered candidate more than a million dollars, if not more.\nNewsom’s team has also bombarded registered voters with text messages reminding them of the Trump endorsement. The campaign admitted to HuffPost that after an initial text-message blitz targeting registered Democrats, in subsequent blasts, it reached a broader universe of voters that includes the state’s Republicans.\n\n\n\nAnd Newsom has made Trump’s support for Cox a theme during his campaign stump speeches.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nA broad array of election watchers view Newsom’s focus on Cox as a sly way to avoid a costly race against a Democrat ― the most competitive of whom is former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ― in a state where Republicans have not won a statewide election since 2006.\nNewsom campaign spokesman Nathan Click claimed that the main goal was to “draw a contrast” between the front-runners, and insisted that the campaign did not “micro-target” Republicans. But he did acknowledge that these measures\xa0“might” have the effect of rallying Republicans behind Cox, and made no effort to deny the possible ancillary benefits of that.\nOf course, public polling showed Newsom and Cox\xa0leading the pack\xa0― with Cox a distant second\xa0― as far back as early April, before the Newsom campaign began its ad blitz.\n\nHe’s just going to screw everybody below him.\nKaren Bernal, chair of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus\n\nBut the governor’s race isn’t the only one this year,\xa0and some in Newsom’s party worry that this Machiavellian tactic could increase overall Republican turnout in November, and thereby undermine the chances of Democrats flipping down-ballot seats.\nKaren Bernal, chairwoman of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus, and Cullen Tiernan ― both progressive activists supporting Eastin for governor ― voiced these concerns.\nNewsom’s move “could crash the blue wave,” said Tiernan, a Fremont-based Marine veteran who chairs the California Democratic Party’s veterans caucus.\nVillaraigosa’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\xa0But a billionaire-backed, pro-charter school super PAC supporting Villaraigosa pointed to Newsom’s messaging as evidence that the lieutenant governor is putting his personal political fortunes ahead of his party and state.\n“This is in keeping with Gavin Newsom’s track record,” said Gary Borden, executive director for the California Charter Schools Association Advocates, the political arm of the trade association running the super PAC.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Cox for Governor/Facebook\n\n\nRepublican John Cox, a San Diego businessman, is currently poised to make it into the general election for governor, preventing a two-Democrat race.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s where there’s another twist in the story. Borden’s super PAC, Families and Teachers for Antonio, has also engaged in its own bit of expensive interference on the Republican side. In a bid to elevate Villaraigosa by depressing support for Cox, the nonpartisan pro-charter school group spent $1.1 million attacking Cox, a San Diego businessman and accountant, as insufficiently conservative. The super PAC hopes to boost Cox’s more marginal conservative opponent, Assemblyman Travis Allen, to make room for Villaraigosa in the top two slots.\nThe pro-Villaraigosa super PAC claims that its kind of interference is different because it does not risk spiking Republican turnout in the same way. But that is less a reflection of the more moderate Villaraigosa’s principles and more a serendipitous feature of his underdog status.\nGriping about Newsom is the latest Democratic headache unique to California’s top-two primary system.\nThe problems this system creates for Democrats in a high-enthusiasm year have been most evident in contentious House races in Southern California. In that part of the state, a glut of Democratic candidates threatens to split the Democratic vote between multiple contenders, locking the party out of the general election.\nWhat’s more, the stakes are especially high in California, where Republicans hold just 14 of the state’s 53 congressional districts. Hillary Clinton won seven of those 14 districts in 2016, making the state especially fertile ground for Democratic pickups of the kind the party will need to retake the House in November.\nThe state party has long viewed the prospect of having two Democrats at the top of the ballot ― in both the gubernatorial race and the Senate race, where Sen. Dianne Feinstein is likely to face fellow Democrat Kevin de León ― as a silver lining in an unfortunate situation created by the top-two system. The theory goes that without a Republican gubernatorial or Senate candidate to support at the top of the ticket, California’s dejected Republicans would be more likely to stay home entirely and make it easier for Democrats in contentious House races.\nA Newsom-Cox showdown for governor takes some of the air out of that scenario.\n“It compounds the top-two problem,” said a prominent California Democratic activist who declined to be named for fear of undermining the likely Democratic front-runner.\n\n\n\n\nLucy Nicholson / Reuters\n\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (D) is running against California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom as a slightly more moderate Democrat.\n\n\n\nBy all appearances though, the national Democratic Party does not share these concerns. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which supports Democrats running for the House, has not issued any public statements aimed at discouraging Newsom.\n“A partisan race for the top of the ticket could possibly be a net-benefit on the Democratic side,” said a national Democratic strategist familiar with the race. “The fear of having a Republican governor could drive out Democrats more than the sort of motivation Cox could provide to Republicans.”\nIt’s of a piece with the argument that Newsom’s campaign makes. Click, the Newsom campaign spokesman, noted that the nonpartisan primary had already cost over $50 million. A Newsom-Villaraigosa battle would undoubtedly cost tens of millions more, while a less competitive Newsom-Cox race would free up donor resources for down-ballot contests.\n“If Gavin is the Democrat in the race, the state party can run a fully coordinated campaign up and down the state,” which, among other perks, would enable it to benefit more directly from Newsom’s fundraising, Click argued.\nOne way or another, the exorbitant chess game that Newsom and Villaraigosa are playing strikes many Californians as still more evidence that the top-two nonpartisan primary system has been a failure.\nThe policy became law in 2011 thanks to Proposition 14, a 2010 ballot initiative promoted by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R). To restore the traditional partisan primary system, Californians would have to undo the current policy in a new referendum.\nIn the meantime, the policy’s biggest victims might just be the state’s hardened progressive activists, many of whom trace their involvement in politics to Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential run.\nThe state’s militantly progressive, pro-Sanders nurses union ― the California Nurses Association ― is backing Newsom, largely thanks to his pledge to prioritize implementing state-level single-payer health insurance. (Villaraigosa has made opposition to the proposal a centerpiece of his campaign.)\nBut Sanders-turned-Eastin backers like Bernal, Tiernan and Higley argue that an intra-Democratic contest for governor would offer more opportunities to pressure the eventual winner to embrace progressive positions. \nBy contrast, a contest between a Democrat and a Republican would encourage the Democratic candidate to court centrist voters ― and potentially take progressives for granted.\nAnd the candidates’ top-two-inspired gimmickry smacks of the cynical campaign tactics and backroom dealing that Sanders acolytes believe is a part of a rigged political system.\n“People are frustrated with the two-party system, and this was meant to be a way to address that,” Tiernan said. “But they just opened up a whole other can of worms.”\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated California has 54 congressional districts. It has 53.\n",

 {'title': 'Renowned Economist Jeffrey Sachs Rips Trump As A Gibbering, ‘Delusional’ Threat',
  'body': '\nAmerican economist Jeffrey Sachs\xa0has written a scathing takedown of President\xa0Donald Trump, calling him a delusional,\xa0psychopathic “threat to the nation and the world.”\nHe might be a “Manchurian Candidate”\xa0who is\xa0working as a “stooge” for some foreign power to destroy the U.S., Sachs wrote on CNN’s website Friday, referring to the spy movie thriller.\n“Much more likely, Trump is just mentally unstable and narcissistic,” he added,\xa0calling the new announcement of tariffs on exports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union part of a “psychopath’s trade war.”\nSachs, a renowned Columbia University professor who heads its Center for Sustainable Development and\xa0serves as a senior adviser\xa0at the United Nations, said no one expressed “a single word of respect for Trump” during his recent trip to Europe. Their question was: “How did America fall so far so fast?” Sachs wrote.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s “so-called policies are not really policies,” he added. “Trade wars are on, off, on hold, on again, within the span of days. ...\xa0Foreign companies are sanctioned today and rescued the next. ...\xa0Global agreements and rules are ripped to shreds. Trump’s garbled syntax and disorganized thoughts are impossible to follow.”\xa0\nSachs has bashed Trump’s economic actions several times. Earlier this year, he said the president’s tariffs prove he “flunked economics” and makes “primitive errors because he hasn’t a clue as to how the world economy works.”\xa0\nRegarding the steel tariffs, Sachs wrote for CNN, “whatever US steel producers might gain from a trade war would be offset by the losses to steel users and consumers, plus the social costs of protecting uncompetitive jobs.”\nOne of Sachs’ biggest targets has been the massive tax cuts and budget deficit, which he has labeled part of the “war” of America’s rich on the poor. “We cannot afford tax cuts. The idea that somehow has gotten into our heads\xa0... that ‘oh, $1.5 trillion, that we can give away,’ is unbelievable in any serious country,” he told Bloomberg last year.\xa0He called the redistribution of wealth in the nation a “populism by the super rich” who “want more and more and more.”\xa0\nBut Sachs’ latest attack in CNN was far more personal about the president. The U.S. has “probably never before had a delusional president, one who speaks gibberish, insults those around him including his closest associates, and baffles the world.\xa0We strive to make sense of Trump’s nonsense, implicitly assuming some hidden strategy. There is none,” Sachs declared.\nHe warned: “Harming our closest allies, raising the prices on key intermediate products, and provoking retaliation cannot possibly deliver higher wages, better jobs, or an improved trade balance.”\nThe “real answer” is to remove Trump from office using the 25th Amendment to replace him, Sachs concludes.\n“Trump is unwell and unfit to be president. He is a growing threat to the nation and the world.\n“The emperor had no clothes. This president has no sense,” he concluded.\n',

John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted Trump\xa0at the time, saying:\xa0“An American president does not lead the Free World, by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.”\nOn the call, Putin and Trump discussed a meeting in the “not-too-distant future,” Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office, The New York Times reported.\nTrump widely lauded Putin during his campaign, calling the former KGB spy a better leader than former President Barack Obama, and expressing a desire to improve relations with the Kremlin. Trump’s often puzzling praise of Putin has raised concerns about the relationship between the two men.

 {'title': 'In Trump’s Zero-Sum World, The Summit Already Has A Winner, And It’s Not Trump',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON\xa0— In President Donald Trump’s world populated only with winners and losers, the on-then-off-now-on-again summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has one sure winner already\xa0— and, say Korea experts, it’s not Trump.\n“Absolutely,” said Jenny Town, the assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. “It was a big win for Kim Jong Un.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump on Friday declared the recently canceled Singapore summit with Kim back on. “You’re going to have a very positive result in the end,” he said after a 90-minute meeting at the White House with a senior North Korean aide.\nBut Kim scored his victory, Town said, way back on March 8, when Trump excitedly accepted Kim’s invitation to a meeting that was relayed by a top South Korean aide. Trump almost immediately changed his tone toward Kim, calling him “very honorable” not long after questioning his sanity and deriding the size and potency of his nuclear arsenal.\n“He’s done quite well for himself,” Town said of Kim, who reportedly had a number of top North Korean officials executed by anti-aircraft gun and his half-brother assassinated with a nerve agent in a foreign airport. “He’s really done quite a lot to rehabilitate his reputation.”\nPerhaps more dangerous for the U.S., Japan and particularly South Korea, Trump’s eagerness for the summit has given more leverage to Kim, who may now be in a much better position to give only token concessions in return for a meeting that puts him on par with the world’s only real superpower, Town said.\n“The messaging now on the summit is more ‘We have to have a summit,’” she said, adding that none of the groundwork for a meaningful deal\xa0— such as even understanding precisely how many nuclear weapons and how much nuclear material North Korea possesses\xa0— has been completed. “That’s the risk we run now, having the show for the sake of the show. This isn’t normal diplomacy.”\nThe White House disputed that Trump is overly eager for the summit or that he is in any danger of getting played by Kim.\n“We continue to actively prepare for a meeting between the president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,” said National Security Council spokesman Robert Palladino.\nTrump’s lawyer and adviser Rudy Giuliani called the summit “a historic achievement” and said there was no way Trump would be taken advantage of by Kim. “No. No. No. You don’t know Donald Trump if you think that,” Giuliani said. “He has understood from the start what he wants … We’re not equal powers. And I think Trump realizes that.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet others close to Trump wonder if he has any understanding of that at all. They point to his fondness for holding mini press conferences with foreign leaders and his receptivity to flattery from them\xa0— and said it is possible that Trump is not aware that Kim and his father,\xa0North Korea’s previous dictator, have been trying to stage a summit with an American president for decades.\n\nPerhaps more dangerous for the U.S., Japan and particularly South Korea, Trump’s eagerness for the summit has given more leverage to Kim.\n\nOne Republican adviser said on condition of anonymity that Trump knows almost nothing of the intricacies of nuclear disarmament in general or of North Korea in particular and is not interested in learning them. “He thinks that all he needs to do is get into a room with Kim for two hours, and he thinks he can get it all worked out,” the adviser said and then pointed to how much Trump enjoyed it when allies on Capitol Hill suggested he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his yet-to-occur summit. “The three best days of his presidency were the days he was talking about the Nobel Prize. He was loving up on that.”\nTrump’s statements have clearly shown how enthusiastic he is for a summit to take place, even after his May 24 letter to Kim calling off the June 12 date, said Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.\n“He’s eager. You could see it in his withdrawal letter. He really wanted it,” Pollack said, adding that he did not understand Trump’s fixation on June 12. “He just seems to equate the meeting with the outcome, and he doesn’t seem to care much about the process … What is so damn special about that date? I don’t know. It just creates this artificial pressure.”\nTrump’s continued optimistic — even boastful — comments about the summit and its outcome are often at odds with statements from North Korea and even his own staff.\nOn May 10, deputy press secretary Raj Shah told reporters on Air Force One that North Korea promised to stop testing nuclear devices and long-range missiles and to avoid publicly criticizing planned U.S.–South Korean military exercises.\nWithin days, North Korea criticized those joint exercises and threatened to back out of the summit\xa0— leading the United States to cancel a portion of the drills that involved B-52 bombers.\nThen, after Trump fired off his letter canceling the summit\xa0— but before he started saying it could be back on as scheduled\xa0— a senior White House official gave reporters a list of steps North Korea said it would take before a summit but did not complete. Among them was allowing in international observers for the much-publicized destruction of a nuclear test site.\n“There has been a trail of broken promises that gave the United States pause,” the official said.\n(Trump later became angry when a published report accurately reflected the official’s sense that a June 12 summit would not be possible at that point because of the lack of time for preparation. Trump falsely claimed the official did not exist, even though the White House staged the briefing and insisted the official’s name not be published.)\nOn Friday, after walking Kim’s envoy, Kim Yong Chol, to his SUV on the White House driveway, Trump again praised North Korea, saying he was holding off on new sanctions because of how well things were going. He said the June 12 meeting might not accomplish an agreement\xa0— he called it a “getting to you know you plus” summit\xa0— and thus might be just the first in a series of summits with Kim Jong Un.\n“He really wants it,” Pollack said. “I don’t know what this summit will amount to. It looks like he just wants the damned photo op. When he agreed to this in the first place, going over his advisers’ head, it was obvious he really wanted it.”\n",

 {'title': 'Google Employees Discuss Staging Protest Of Their Own Company',
  'body': "\nA small group of Google employees, in response to a company contract with a Pentagon-backed program called Maven,\xa0have discussed the idea of staging a protest at a conference in July. Employees fear that the project, which provides artificial intelligence tools to the military, could be used in fatal drone strikes. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe protest, as discussed in preliminary exchanges over Google’s internal communications platform, would take place at a Google Cloud conference in San Francisco, according to messages obtained by HuffPost and an interview with an employee. \nMore than a dozen Google employees have resigned over the project, according to Gizmodo, and thousands of employees have signed a letter protesting it. \nNow Google employees are debating showing resistance in a more active way, through a potential demonstration. \xa0\nDiscussions regarding the possibility of a protest took place this week on an internal thread devoted to criticism of Maven. The thread, called “maven conscientious objectors,” includes hundreds of employees, but only a small percentage of those were active in the discussion. \nThe debate about staging a physical demonstration took place on Wednesday and Thursday and was started by a departing engineer. The employee called the project “the greatest ethical crises in technology of our generation” and suggested that “Maven protesters” go to the conference with the aim of “making some noise.” \nThe employee’s last day was Friday, but by late morning, someone from human resources had asked them to leave immediately due to their “recent statements” related to the conference. “As such, we’re going to move up your exit by a few hours and we’ve ended access, effective immediately,” the HR person wrote. \nIn response to the initial thread, another employee called the engineer an “agent provocateur.” Someone else said such an action would “be enough reason to fire us lot with popular support.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate became heated and personal, with some employees questioning whether their colleague who originally suggested the idea of a physical protest should even belong in the “conscientious objectors” group.\nBut there were a few employees who supported the idea, calling the discussion “legitimate topics for this mailing list.” Another said that while they were not based in San Francisco and were thus unable to join the action, they personally thought the protest was “a good idea since it increases Google’s PR cost of getting involved in military projects.” \nRepresentatives for Google did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The Intercept reported Friday afternoon that Google will not renew its contract to work on Project Maven, though the company plans to work on the project through June 2019 and has not ruled out taking on similar work in the future.\nThis isn’t the first round of discord from Google employees. In an April petition to Google CEO Sundar Pichai protesting the Pentagon contract and signed by thousands, petitioners referenced “Don’t be evil,” Google’s famous former unofficial motto,\xa0as an argument for canceling the contract.\n“This contract puts Google’s reputation at risk and stands in direct opposition to our core values. Building this technology to assist the US Government in military surveillance ― and potentially lethal outcomes ― is not acceptable,” the signers of the petition\xa0wrote.\nHundreds of academics subsequently wrote a letter to Google co-founder Larry Page, as well as Pichai and other company leaders, supporting the petitioning employees. \nThe academics expressed concern that Project Maven will help the military become “just a short step away from authorizing autonomous drones to kill automatically, without human supervision or meaningful human control.” The letter also cited recent Cambridge Analytica scandals as demonstrating “growing public concern over allowing the tech industries to wield so much power.”\nAt a recent companywide meeting, Sergey Brin, one of Google’s co-founders, reportedly responded to a question about the project and addressed some of the controversies, according to The New York Times. Brin explained that he thought it was better for the world’s militaries to be partnered with an international company like Google, rather than nationalistic defense contractors.\nThe employee who started the discussion about protesting Google’s involvement with Maven implied on the thread that they gave notice due to a violation of their own ethical standards.\n“The time to protest is now or never,” the employee wrote. \nAre you a Google employee who wants to talk about your experience with Maven?

 {'title': 'Trump Leaked Sensitive Info From The May Jobs Report, And That’s A Big Effing Problem',
  'body': '\nA president who is obsessed with stopping leaks leaked extremely sensitive economic information about May’s jobs report Friday morning, over an hour before the report was officially released.\n“Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning,” President Donald Trump tweeted at 7:21 a.m.,\xa0hinting the numbers would be favorable. Not only is that an hour before the report’s release, it’s a full two hours before government appointees are legally allowed to say anything at all.\xa0\n\n\n\nAside from the sheer hypocrisy of Trump, one, leaking and, two, playing up the importance of a report he used to dismiss as “phony” and “one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics,” it also makes for deeply problematic economic policy.\nThat’s according to Justin Wolfers,\xa0a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office, among\xa0other things. Wolfers said the president’s disclosure is unprecedented both in the U.S. and among his counterparts in other developed countries. And it’s unprecedented for a handful of really, really good reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump is making America Greek again (i.e., bad things happen when data is politicized).\nIt’s extremely important that the data we use to determine how healthy the economy is remain totally independent and free from political influence.\xa0Trump teasing and putting a political spin on numbers ahead of their release casts doubt on whether they’re accurate and honest.\nThe data in these reports are the result of countless hours of work by a group Wolfers characterized as “nerds in basements.” Markets trust number-crunching nerds who work for government agencies that operate above the political fray. They don’t trust politicians.\n“The reason for that is, in many tin-pot countries, autocrats start fiddling with the statistics,” Wolfers said. “When they start doing that, no one believes them, and you end with a situation like in Greece, where nobody wants to loan you money.”\n“The original sin that led to the Greek crisis is that they were dishonest with their economic statistics,”\xa0Wolfers added. “This is a step toward undermining that. There’s nothing good at the end of that pathway.”\nIt’s illegal and undermines fundamental trading rules.\nA fundamental principle of the economy is the ideal that everyone has access to the same information as everyone else. Information that could send markets skyrocketing, plummeting or even staying the course is tightly guarded, and doled out in a manner meant to ensure everyone has equal access.\nTrump was one of a highly select group of people briefed on the jobs report ahead of time. By tweeting about it prior to its release, he turned the system on its head ― and that’s illegal.\n“If any public official under any previous administration had issued that tweet, they would get fired within the hour,” Wolfers said.\nFormer President Barack Obama’s onetime chief economic adviser Austan Goolsbee told\xa0Politico, “If the president just tipped that the numbers are good, he broke the law.”\xa0\nAnyone armed with extra information ― say a friend Trump told while chatting on the phone\xa0Thursday night, or someone who saw Trump’s tweet at just the right moment ― can use it to make a lot of money at someone else’s expense.\n“If someone makes money in a casino, someone else is losing it,” Wolfers explained, “and that’s likely yours and my retirement account.”\nWolfers hasn’t yet been able to dig into Friday’s pre-market data and conclusively say that’s what happened after Trump tweeted, but he said at first glance it’s “highly suggestive.”\n“If you’re a financial market trader and you saw that tweet and you were aware the president has been briefed on the numbers, you’d have to be a fool to not know what was up,” he said. “Traders with millions on the line are doing something.”\nIllegality aside, it’s just bad for the economy.\n“It’s clear the president doesn’t take his responsibility to treat confidential data seriously,” said Wolfers. “Now every time he speaks we’re going to be wondering, ‘Did we just learn something?’ And if he sounds optimistic, we’ll buy, and if he sounds pessimistic, we’ll sell.\n“That’s extra volatility we don’t need.”\nIn addition to destabilizing the market, Trump’s tweet undermines the White House’s own ability to send legitimate economic signals when they actually matter.\n“There are times when the White House needs to speak and be understood,” Wolfers said. “All of this confuses the White House’s message, not in the political sense, but in the economic sense.”\nSo in the future, if Trump’s economic adviser recommends broadcasting a message that seeks to either boost or cool down the markets, for example, economists may disregard the signal seeing it as Trump crying wolf.\xa0\xa0\n“When it’s time,” Wolfers warned, “the markets will respond less than they should.”\n',

 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Prefers Fancy Silver Fountain Pens At $130 A Pop',
  'body': '\nIf you thought Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt’s expenditures couldn’t possibly get more ridiculous, guess again.\xa0\nThe Washington Post on Friday reported that the EPA purchased a dozen silver fountain pens from a jewelry store in Washington, D.C., featuring the agency’s seal and Pruitt’s signatures. The cost to taxpayers: $130 apiece.\xa0\nThe pens were part of a $3,230 order in August from Tiny Jewel Box that also reportedly included personalized journals.\n“The cost of the Qty. 12 Fountain Pens will be around $1,560.00,” an account manager at the jewelry store wrote in an email to Millan Hupp, Pruitt’s head of scheduling and advance. “All the other items total cost is around $1,670.00 which these items are in process. Please advise.”\n“Yes, please order,” Hupp responded that same day. “Thank you.”\nEPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox defended the pen purchase in a statement to the Washington Post, saying they “were made for the purpose of serving as gifts to the Administrator’s foreign counterparts and dignitaries upon his meeting with them.”\nThe expense comes as Pruitt faces a whirlwind of corruption accusations and ethical scandals. While pushing for sweeping budget cuts at the federal agency, Pruitt has been seemingly\xa0loose with the taxpayer’s dime.\xa0\nIn April, a government watchdog found that Pruitt broke the law when he spent $43,000 to install a soundproof phone booth in his office. Other questionable, high-end expenses include non-commercial and first-class airfare and an unprecedented security detail.\xa0Several high-ranking officials at the agency were reassigned, demoted or opted to leave after expressing concerns about pricey office furniture, as well as requests for a bulletproof SUV, a 20-person security detail and $100,000-a-month charter aircraft membership, as The New York Times reported in April.\nPruitt has largely pointed the finger at his own staff at the agency he runs.\n“I’m having to answer questions about decisions that others made,” Pruitt said in\xa0an interview with the Washington Free Beacon this week. “And that’s not an excuse, it’s just reality.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n“Luke Cage” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry.

This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n',

 {'title': 'Porn Leads To School Shootings, GOP Congresswoman Says',
  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know what kind of porn Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) is watching?\nWhatever it is, the 67-year-old Black, who is running for governor of Tennessee, said it’s a “big part” of what is driving the spike in school shootings.\nDuring a meeting last week with local pastors, Black raised the issue of gun violence in schools and why it keeps happening.\n“Pornography,” she said.\n“It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,” she continued. “All of this is available without parental guidance. I think that is a big part of the root cause.”\nHere’s an audio of her remarks, which she made during a listening session with ministers at Safe Harbor of Clarksville, Tennessee.\n\nBlack didn’t clarify what it is about porn that she thinks is leading to school massacres.

 {'title': 'Business Groups Might Be Quietly Killing A Bill That Would Bring Sexual Abuse Claims To Light',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON — After widespread public criticism of its sexual harassment policies, Uber this week announced that it would end its practice of forcing individual sexual harassment accusers into private arbitration.\xa0It’s among a small handful of companies who have taken a stand against the legal mechanism, which can effectively silence victims of sexual harassment and assault by giving employers disproportionate power.\nShortly after, its ride-sharing rival Lyft announced a similar policy, joining Microsoft, the first major company to ban the practice back in December.\nCongress could make all companies follow suit and allow individuals to take sexual harassment cases against employers to court. In December, Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation in the House and Senate that would ban employers across the board from applying forced arbitration in cases involving workplace sexual harassment. \nThe legislation boasted a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, and it had a boost from former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, whose contract contained a forced arbitration clause when she leveled sexual harassment claims against executives at the cable news giant.\n\n\n\n\nAlex Wong via Getty Images\n\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) (C) and former Fox News commentator Gretchen Carlson (R) listen as Rep.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the Senate bill’s co-sponsors.\nDuring a press conference introducing the legislation in December, Graham called on business leaders and groups like chambers of commerce to lend their support, arguing that it was good for their interests.\nHowever, when HuffPost contacted the other organizations that have disclosed lobbying related to the bill, two of them — the National Retail Federation and the Society of Human Resources Management — confirmed that they oppose the bill.\xa0Others said that they do not have an official position on the bill, but have favored arbitration in the past.\nWhen asked about its lobbying, the National Retail Federation said it has been “working to educate members of Congress on how arbitration agreements serve the interests of both workers and employers by avoiding lengthy, costly litigation and ensuring a fair and fast process for resolving workplace disputes,” according to a statement from Lizzy Simmons, NRF’s vice president for government relations. “Arbitration also offers an added virtue of occasionally settling these disputes with less rancor than a lawsuit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokeswoman for SHRM wrote in an email that the group\xa0“supports public-policy proposals that promote an accessible, prompt and fair resolution of harassment claims in the workplace while protecting confidentiality and due process, including in arbitration.”\nLauren Sheets Jarrell, chief counsel at the American Tort Reform Association, said in an email that “we generally support arbitration as an efficient tool for judicial economy.” When asked about the group’s lobbying, she said that it had not taken a position on the bill.\n“We’re taking a look at these pieces of legislation and discussing them with our members. The Chamber will work with anyone to make sure appropriate steps are taken to combat sexual harassment,” a spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said.\xa0\nIn the past, the Chamber has opposed other efforts to restrict forced arbitration.\n\nI think if companies are unwilling to support a sexual harassment survivor or sexual assault survivor’s right to file a claim in open court, they should say so.”\nJulia Duncan, senior director of government affairs at the American Association for Justice\n\nEarlier this year, Facebook, which also has reported lobbying activity,\xa0said that it was considering its position on the bill. A company spokeswoman said Thursday that there were no updates.\xa0Uber, which is not among the companies that have reported lobbying activity, said Tuesday it supports the bill.\nBoth\xa0bills\xa0were referred to their corresponding committees and subcommittees, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\xa0\nA spokeswoman for the House subcommittee’s GOP vice chair, Rep.

Tom Marino (R-Pa.) did not return multiple requests for comment.\nA spokeswoman for HELP committee chair Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)\xa0did not immediately return a request for comment on any updates on the bill.\nAdvocates for the legislation suggested that the relative lack of public support from companies and interest groups are the reason for the bill stalling and argued that their apparent reluctance to state a position shows that they may not want to publicly say that they are against it.\n“Publicly, everybody will tell you, we support women’s rights, we support the rights of rape survivors, but privately, companies are lobbying against the bill,” said Julia Duncan, senior director of government affairs at the American Association for Justice, one group that has lobbied in favor of the bill. “I think if companies are unwilling to support a sexual harassment survivor or sexual assault survivor’s right to file a claim in open court, they should say so.”\nDuncan argued that congressional action is necessary because it’s not enough to put the onus on individual companies like Uber to reform their practices.\n“Uber can say, ‘Yes, I will face these nine women in court for these claims,’ and tomorrow, they could reverse their position and say, ‘Everybody else goes to forced arbitration.’ There’s nothing in the law that says they can’t do that,” she said. “The vast majority of companies will continue to force people into arbitration, no matter how bad it makes them look.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Congressional Sexual Harassment Bill Would Stop Employers From Trying To Silence Accusers\n\n\n\n\n\nUber Ends Forced Arbitration In Individual Cases Of Sexual Assault, Harassment\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Defends Its Use Of Secret Courts To Handle Sexual Harassment Cases\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Uber Silences Women After Sexual Assaults\n\n\n\n",

Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,” Mnuchin said in a television interview on “Fox News Sunday.”\nOn Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China.\nDuring an initial round of talks earlier this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries’ joint statement on Saturday.\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross planned to go to China, Mnuchin and Kudlow said.\n“He’s going to be looking into a number of areas where we’re going to have greatly significant increases,” including energy, liquefied natural gas, agriculture and manufacturing, Kudlow said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.”\nMnuchin said the United States expects to see a big increase of between 35 percent and 40 percent in agricultural exports to China and a doubling of energy purchases over the next three to five years.\n“We have specific targets. I am not going to publicly disclose what they are. They go industry by industry,” Mnuchin said. (Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir, Howard Schneider, Doina Chiacu; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)\n',

The president has time and again made promises of giving money to good causes without ever following through.\nIn 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer reviewed hundreds of pages of records to find that Trump and his charity hadn’t donated a single cent to a major 9/11 charity. Maybe that wouldn’t have been such a big deal if Trump hadn’t previously boasted about giving $10,000 to the fund.\nAnd in a monthslong investigation, The Washington Post called more than 400 charities with connections to Trump\xa0only to find a single personal donation from him between 2008 and 2016.\nHis own self-described charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, shut down last year after it was found to have violated federal rules on “self-dealing.”\xa0The foundation was wracked with claims it was functioning as a political slush fund, and at one point Trump reportedly spent $20,000 of the “charitable” money\xa0on a 6-foot-tall portrait.\nThe portrait was of himself.\n\n\nXContent loading..\n\n',

 {'title': 'Republican Immigration Fight Derails Food Stamp Bill',
  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON ― The most conservative Republicans in Congress say they won’t vote for food stamp cuts they support unless party leadership gives them what they want on immigration, potentially holding up the farm bill this week.\xa0\n“We don’t have an agreement,” House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Thursday after coming out of a meeting with his conservative group.\nSince Democrats seem almost unanimously against the farm bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) needs most Republicans to support it. And with roughly a dozen moderates already stating their opposition to the farm bill, the opposition of another dozen to two-dozen conservatives in the Freedom Caucus would almost certainly sink the farm bill. \nWith such significant opposition, House GOP leaders may decide to postpone a vote and send members home for the week, but House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday the House would move forward with a Friday vote.\nMeadows wants Ryan’s assurance of a vote on an immigration bill by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) that would strictly limit legal immigration and ramp up deportations. The Freedom Caucus is also now working with moderates on a sort of compromise bill that would stick to President Donald Trump’s “four pillars” on an immigration bill: a wall, scaling back family migration, ending the visa lottery program and a fix for immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n“We think it’s important we have a vote on Goodlatte and at this point, we were not able to convince any of our members to go from ‘no’ to ‘yes’ on the farm bill,” Meadows said.\nModerate Republicans and Democrats are trying to force a vote on a separate immigration bill through a parliamentary maneuver known as a “discharge petition,” which can bring legislation to the floor of the House against the wishes of party leaders. Moderates want protected legal status for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\nMeadows said he believed Republicans could quickly reach a consensus on immigration that may even attract Democrats, but he and other conservatives in the Freedom Caucus want to use their leverage on the farm bill to make sure leaders work toward an immigration agreement before a discharge petition addressing DACA ripens by the end of June.\nWith farm subsidy programs expiring at the end of September, the Freedom Caucus believes the farm bill is the only must-pass piece of legislation they can use to extract concessions on immigration, which they believe is a related issue to the farm bill anyway. (Most of the spending in the farm bill goes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, which serves 40 million Americans. Those benefits would not stop being issued even if authorization expires,\xa0though some farm programs would be affected.) \nMeadows declined to name a specific number of Freedom Caucus members who remain opposed to the bill, but another Freedom Caucus member told HuffPost they had at least 18 members willing to hold up the farm bill.\nRepublicans had planned to vote on the farm bill Friday, but if it clearly lacks support that vote could be in doubt. Meadows said he’s not in a hurry. \n“We don’t have an impending deadline for the farm bill,” he said. “It doesn’t expire until September.” \nWhatever the House passes would have to be merged with a separate farm bill from the Senate, which has not yet been released. \nFormer Agriculture Committee chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), who saw his own farm bill hijacked on the House floor in 2013, said he thought linking the bill to immigration wouldn’t be a good way to pass the legislation. \n“I believe that is just a load too heavy for the farm bill to carry,” Lucas said.\n',

 {'title': 'Retiring Lawmakers Have Added $32.8 Million To Campaign Treasuries Since Last Election',
  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Frank Bass, MapLight\nMore than five dozen congressmen who have retired or plan to retire next year have raised at least $32.8 million since the 2016 election, according to a MapLight analysis of campaign data. The 64 departing senators and representatives have accumulated $95.1 million in campaign funds.\nAt least $87.3 million in campaign funds raised by retiring lawmakers is stored in committee treasuries, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. The surplus money can be transferred to a party, donated to other candidates, donated to a nonprofit foundation, or used to continue political activity of retiring lawmakers. Loopholes, however, are egregious and common. The remaining $7.8 million balance in “leadership committees” is subject to fewer restrictions and can be kept by the retiring lawmakers.\nThe excess campaign funds have accumulated as the Federal Election Commission considers a new rule proposed in March that would prevent retired lawmakers from continuing to use campaign funds for questionable expenditures that have included everything from the costs of private club memberships and monthly cell phone bills to consulting services paid by the campaign fund of a dead congressman. The FEC is accepting public comments on its proposal until Monday.\n“It shows that there’s unanimous agreement on the part of the FEC that this is a problem,” said Brendan Fischer, a lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that pushed the commission into drafting the proposal. “It’s sending a signal to former officeholders you can’t use leftover campaign money as a slush fund.”\nThe retiring crop of lawmakers may still have a chance to use the money to their own benefit, said Fischer. The FEC is considering a two-year window to dispose of a surplus for retiring members of the House of Representatives, and a four-year window for retiring senators.\nSixty-four lawmakers have either retired or announced plans to retire in the wake of Donald Trump’s 2016 White House victory. The retiring lawmakers include 45 Republicans who have declined to run for re-election. Eight House GOP members are leaving their seats to run for the Senate; five Republican lawmakers are running for governor.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced his plans to quit last month, will dispose of the largest war chest of any retiring lawmaker. The Wisconsin Republican reported $13.1 million in campaign funds at the end of March, roughly $2.7 million more than his balance at the end of 2016. At the end of March, Ryan’s campaign funds include $10.6 million in a committee fund and a $2.6 million balance in Prosperity Action, a leadership PAC.\nRep. Beto O’Rourke, a Texas Democrat, reported an $8 million campaign balance at the end of March, about a $7.6 million increase over his 2016 balance. O’Rourke, who doesn’t have a leadership PAC, is using the campaign committee funds in his bid to unseat unpopular incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz, a first-term Republican.\nO’Rourke is among eight retiring Democrats running for a different office. Two Democrats ― Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan ― resigned in December after being accused of sexually harassing women.\nOnly two retiring lawmakers reported a zero campaign fund balance at the end of March ― Rep. John Delaney, a Maryland lawmaker who has announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and Rep. Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican who’s leaving Capitol Hill to run for governor.\n',

 {'title': 'Trump’s Stormy Daniels Disclosure Still Leaves Questions About Payments To Cohen',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ―\xa0When the pre-election payment from President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer to porn actress Stormy Daniels not to discuss the affair she says she had with him first came to light, the figure cited was $130,000.\nWeeks later, as Trump’s latest lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, finally acknowledged that Trump was aware of Michael Cohen’s payment and had repaid him for it, Giuliani cited $35,000 monthly payments over the course of a year ― or $420,000.\nAnd on Wednesday, when Trump for the first time acknowledged the payment on his financial disclosure form, it was characterized as a “reimbursement” of “expenses” that Cohen incurred in 2016, with a value between $100,000 and $250,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what’s going on? Why did Trump pay Cohen $420,000 for a $130,000 expense?\nThat remains unclear.\nGiuliani, in several interviews with HuffPost over the course of a week, explained that Trump also paid enough to cover all the taxes Cohen would have had to pay to have been left with $130,000 ― the original sum he paid out of his own pocket. Giuliani estimated that this added another $70,000, plus some profit for Cohen, plus some other expenses.\nWhat other expenses?\n“That’s privileged,” Giuliani said.\nKathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University, began laughing as she listened to a summary of Giuliani’s explanations.\n“It seems nonsensical, because it is nonsensical,” she said.\nBoth Trump and his White House had claimed for months that Trump knew nothing about Cohen’s payment to Daniels. Those statements, though, were proven false when Giuliani began explaining last month that Trump had repaid Cohen. Giuliani was emphasizing that because Trump repaid Cohen, the $130,000 could not be construed as a campaign finance law violation, as candidates are permitted to spend as much as they want on their own races.\nBecause Trump had not disclosed his debt to Cohen on the financial disclosure form he filed last June, the Office of Government Ethics referred his failure to do so to the Justice Department on Wednesday, when Trump belatedly revealed that payment on this year’s form. “Knowingly and willfully” withholding that information on that form is punishable by as much as a year in jail, per federal statute.\nGiuliani said Trump was under no obligation to report the payments to Cohen to repay Daniels ― “There’s no place on the form to disclose it” ― but said he advised Trump to do it anyway, as he anticipated that OGE officials would argue it should be disclosed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe insisted that the payment to Daniels was entirely normal, something done all the time by famous people wanting nuisances to go away. “This is a perfectly legitimate thing. There’s nothing wrong with it,” he said.\nOther lawyers, though, said that Cohen’s use of a newly created shell company to pay Daniels suggested otherwise.\n“This whole thing is highly suspicious, highly unusual,” said a lawyer with two decades of experience in business law who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I’d be very reluctant to be involved in anything like this.”\nAnother lawyer familiar with nondisclosure agreements who spoke on condition of anonymity had a simple explanation for Giuliani’s contortions: “Paying hush money to porn stars is not a legitimate business expense.”\nBut technically, the nondisclosure agreement was a standard services contract ― except that in this case, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was being paid for the service of remaining silent.\nThat payment from Trump to Clifford via Cohen would clearly be a business expense for Cohen, and therefore not taxable income, said a Washington, D.C., tax lawyer, also on condition of anonymity.\n“That’s not your money. That’s not income to you,” the lawyer said. “I disagree with Giuliani’s characterization of this. I don’t see why it would have to be out of after-tax earnings.”\nIn any event, Trump’s payment to Cohen of close to half a million dollars still makes no sense, Clark said, if it was to reimburse Cohen for a payment to Daniels that was less than one-third that amount.\n“What Giuliani seems to be acknowledging is that this was not the only hush payment,” she said. “There’s no other way to make the math work.”\nMichael Avenatti, Daniels’ new lawyer who is trying to invalidate the 2016 “hush agreement” in court, told NBC News on Thursday that he is researching the stories of two other women who have come to him claiming they have similar agreements with Trump negotiated by Cohen.\nGiuliani himself allowed that possibility in an ABC News interview last month, saying that while he did not have knowledge of other women who might have been paid off, Cohen would have done that “if it was necessary.”\nLate\xa0Wednesday, he would not say if he’d yet learned the nature of those other expenses ― “none of which are my concern or yours,” he said.\nHe reiterated that the Daniels payment was not a campaign expense that needed to be reported. He acknowledged that keeping Daniels out of the news in the days leading up to the election was helpful to Trump’s campaign, but he said it benefited the campaign in the same way, for example, that a new suit that Trump bought to wear during a debate might have.\n“This payment would have been made in any event,” he said. “It’s not a campaign expense. It would have been made at any other time to protect his family and his reputation.”\nGiuliani did say, however, that his earlier belief that Trump had sought to pay for Cohen’s taxes on the $130,000 was incorrect. He said the repayment was for $130,000 exactly, and no more.\n“I was wrong about it,” he said.\n",

 {'title': 'Interior Dept. Dodges Watchdog’s Questions About Zinke’s Call To Alaska Senators',
  'body': "\nThe Interior Department took six months to respond to investigators probing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s apparent effort to bully\xa0Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) into supporting\xa0Obamacare\xa0repeal last year, and ultimately skirted their questions.\nIn a letter HuffPost obtained, Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch brothers adviser appointed principal deputy solicitor in May, refused to give the Government Accountability Office details about Zinke’s July phone call to Murkowski and fellow Alaska Republican Dan Sullivan.\nDetails about what Zinke said to the lawmakers “are immaterial to the legal issues you have raised,” Jorjani wrote to Edda Perez, a managing associate general counsel at GAO.\n\n\n\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images\n\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) arrive for a Senate hearing in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Anchorage Daily News first reported, Zinke phoned Murkowski and Sullivan after Murkowski voted in July against a measure to begin debate on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Sullivan told the paper that Zinke had delivered a “troubling message,” indicating that Murkowski’s defection could jeopardize future energy projects in Alaska.\nIn the end, despite an online scolding from President Donald Trump, the Alaska senator stood her ground and joined two other Republicans in defeating a “skinny” repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \xa0\nZinke and Murkowski both disputed media reports about the phone call. Zinke dismissed the idea that he threatened the senator as “laughable,” E&E News reported. Murkowski called the conversation “difficult” and said Zinke was simply “sharing the concern that the president had expressed to him to pass on to me,” according to The Hill.\nThe Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General launched a preliminary investigation into Zinke’s alleged attempt to pressure Murkowski in early August, but both Alaska senators refused to be interviewed, effectively shutting those efforts down, according to a letter the inspector general sent to Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Raul Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.). \nThe GAO followed up with its own investigation\xa0in early September at the request of Pallone and Grijalva. In their letter, the two Democratic lawmakers requested a formal determination regarding possible legal violations.\nLater that month, the Interior Department received an inquiry from GAO counsel Perez, as Jorjani noted in his response six months later. \nAlong with details about the call, Perez asked the department if it believes money appropriated for Zinke’s salary and related expenses “is available for the purpose of communicating with senators about pending healthcare legislation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In our view,” Jorjani responded, “this appropriation was available for the Secretary’s call with the senators regardless of the topic that was discussed because the Secretary is authorized to engage in activities beyond his statutory duties and entitled to his salary incident to the office he holds — not the performance of any particular matter.” \nJorjani also said he was unaware of the agency failing to meet its obligations or withholding money from the state of Alaska. There is no evidence that Zinke or the Interior Department retaliated\xa0against Murkowski for her vote.\nThe Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Thursday.\nAsked about the GAO’s investigation into Zinke’s call, Charles Young, GAO’s public affairs managing director, told HuffPost that “no final determination has been made yet.” Young said he was unable to provide HuffPost with Perez’s initial letter to the Interior Department or comment on Jorjani’s response to it.\nIn an emailed statement, Grijalva said the Interior Department’s letter suggests Zinke believes he’s above the law. \n“Secretary Zinke’s tenure has been marked by scandals, embarrassments and misuses of public resources, and given the tone of this response to GAO, I’m concerned that he truly has no idea how out of touch he appears,” Grijalva said. “He needs more serious congressional oversight than today’s Republican majority is capable of providing.”\n Interior Dept. response to GAO by Anonymous MMpWso on Scribd\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nIf You Come At Sen.

 {'title': 'Scam PACs Ripped Off Conservatives With Pro-Police, Anti-Abortion Messages: Prosecutors',
  'body': '\nFederal authorities\xa0arrested two Arizona brothers on Thursday\xa0and charged them with making millions of dollars through phony political action committees that scammed donors.\nWilliam and Robert Tierney ran or were involved in nine different PACs that collected small donations solely to enrich themselves,\xa0prosecutors with the Southern District of New York allege in a criminal complaint. The supposed PACs collected $23 million from 2014-2017 and routed the vast majority of the funds through a series of shell companies that either directly enriched the Tierneys or continued the fundraising scheme, the complaint says. \nMost of the so-called PACs’ fundraising appeals allegedly targeted conservatives with promises to support law enforcement, oppose Planned Parenthood, advocate for pro-life policies and promote smaller government.\xa0But prosecutors say they did none of those things.\n“The defendants, as alleged, capitalized on the sympathy and activism of those who sought to support awareness of various causes near and dear to their hearts,” FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney Jr. said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charges brought by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan are so far the most high profile effort by federal law enforcement to crack down on operators of scam PACs. Scam PACs have emerged over the last decade as a new field for fraudsters to trick people, often the elderly, into giving up their money. This phenomenon emerged as campaign money boomed following a series of deregulatory court decisions and a declaration from the Federal Election Commission that it did not have the legal authority to crack down on scams.\nIn July 2015, then-FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel wrote a column for Roll Call explaining that “the law doesn’t give the FEC the tools or the authority needed to address scam PAC activity.”\nIn fact, prosecutors say, this article caught the eye of William Tierney, as it mentioned one of his supposed PACs.\xa0The complaint details an email in which he expressed concern to an unnamed co-conspirator that perhaps the PAC should spend more on politics to throw regulators off the scent.\nBut prosecutors say the co-conspirator dismissed the concern: “The reality is that to these people there will be little difference between 0% and 5%.”\nScam PACs almost always operate in a similar fashion. The founders take a cause or a candidate popular with elderly donors, say former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) or former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West, and spend money on telemarketing and direct mail to raise money. Those donations are then paid to the founders and also cycled back into further fundraising. Sometimes the scammers even own the firms doing the telemarketing.\nThursday’s complaint against the Tierney brothers, which is based on their subpoenaed emails, phone records and work documents, details precisely how this type of alleged scam works.\xa0Prosecutors allege as follows:\nThe Tierneys set up six PACs ― Grassroots Awareness PAC, Americans for Law Enforcement PAC, National Campaign PAC, Voter Education PAC, Action Coalition PAC and Protect Our Future PAC ― and controlled three others called Life and Liberty PAC, Republican Majority PAC and RightMarch.com PAC. All were registered in other people’s names. For the PACs the brothers founded,\xa0a third, unnamed co-conspirator signed on as the treasurer using a middle name. (FEC records show the name Ann Mattson.)\nEach PAC promoted advocacy on a particular issue that might attract small donations. Grassroots Awareness PAC claimed to be “dedicated to raising awareness and advocating on behalf of children with autism spectrum disorder and other important health issues affecting Americans.” Americans for Law Enforcement PAC said that it “builds support nationwide for local law enforcement.” Voter Education PAC supposedly promoted “individual liberty, smaller government, traditional values, economic opportunity, a strong national defense and energy independence.”\xa0National Campaign PAC, Action Coalition PAC and Protect Our Future PAC all targeted abortion opponents.\nTo obscure the involvement of the alleged profiteers, each PAC paid money to a series of phony shell companies, which prosecutors say William Tierney referred to as “Stealth LLCs.” In some cases, these were simply LLCs created to look like consulting firms that actually paid money directly to the scammers. In other cases, William Tierney told the telemarketing firms he worked with to create separate LLCs for each PAC they worked with to obscure the payments.\nWilliam Tierney allegedly provided an entire memo to the telemarketing firms detailing exactly how they should create these LLCs to “establish our privacy goals.” The LLCs should be set up on different dates and by different people who should “not [be] someone easily discoverable on Google as being related to your company or each other.” They shouldn’t have a name that could identify them as related to the telemarketing firm or the PAC they would work for, he allegedly instructed.\nProsecutors say William Tierney ultimately pocketed $3 million from the scam. His brother Robert allegedly received $600,000, while the co-conspirator allegedly took in $250,000.\nHuffPost could not immediately determine contact information for the Tierneys.\n',

  'body': "\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump\xa0on Thursday\xa0pardoned conservative crank Dinesh D’Souza, who in 2014 was convicted of making an illegal donation to a Republican Senate candidate.\n\nIt was Trump’s fifth presidential pardon, following those of other well-known figures such as former Sheriff Joe Arpaio\xa0of Maricopa County, Arizona, and I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.\nHere’s a look at some of the things D’Souza is known for:\nD’Souza mocked school shooting survivors.\nLess than a week after a gunman in Parkland, Florida, slaughtered 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, D’Souza openly mocked the surviving children.\nAn Associated Press photographer captured an image of the school shooting survivors weeping after Florida lawmakers voted down a\xa0bill to ban assault weapons\xa0in the state. D’Souza pounced at the opportunity to ridicule the students: “Worst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,” he tweeted.\n\nWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs https://t.co/Vg3mXYvb4c— Dinesh D’Souza (@DineshDSouza) February 20, 2018\n\n\n\nHe followed that up with another callous tweet: “Adults 1, kids 0.”\n\nAdults 1, kids 0 https://t.co/24iqKtnTxy— Dinesh D’Souza (@DineshDSouza) February 20, 2018\n\n\n\nHe defended Adolf Hitler.\nYou aren’t misreading that. D’Souza has indicated that maybe Hitler wasn’t as bad as people made him out to be.\xa0\n“Hitler was NOT anti-gay,” D’Souza tweeted last year. (Hitler actually was\xa0― he\xa0killed thousands of gay people.)\xa0“He refused to purge gay Brownshirts from Nazi ranks saying he had no problem as long as they were good fighters.”\n\nHitler was NOT anti-gay. He refused to purge gay Brownshirts from Nazi ranks saying he had no problem as long as they were good fighters— Dinesh D’Souza (@DineshDSouza) October 6, 2017\n\n\n\nHe said the Charlottesville rally may have been ‘staged.’\nWhite supremacists took to the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer to chant Nazi slogans such as “Blood and soil!” and “Jews will not replace us!”\nViolent clashes\xa0erupted between the racists and the people protesting against them, and Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when a white supremacist allegedly drove a car into a group of counterprotesters.\xa0\nIn an interview with a radio show following the rally, D’Souza wasted no time in blaming supporters of former President Barack Obama for the tragedy.\n“The white supremacist leader of this group is an Obama guy and an Occupy Wall Street guy, so right away you know that this could be a sort of staged Nazism that we’re seeing for the benefit of serving a narrative,” D’Souza said.\nTwo days later, he said he wondered if the “rally was a staged event.”\n\nCan a genuine white supremacist be an Obama guy?

 {'title': 'Does Rush Limbaugh Matter Anymore?',
  'body': '\nIn early March, Rush Limbaugh, the progenitor of conservative shock talk radio, took a call from Gary, a listener concerned that the veteran pundit was losing his edge. \nHad Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election and behaved in a manner similar to President Donald Trump, Gary alleged, “you would be fricasseeing her every moment of your show.”\nLimbaugh, 67, responded with characteristic bluster, mock surprise and a healthy dose of self-pity. Admitting that Trump is “by no means an ideological conservative,” Limbaugh, as is his wont, reframed one of the most powerful men in the world and himself, still the most popular talk radio host in the country, as Davids battling a liberal Goliath.\nLimbaugh insisted, without much elaboration, that though the president isn’t an ideologue, he is\xa0“the only thing standing in the way of the forces of the left ruining this country.” For good measure, the host sprinkled in some “anti-globalist” language about the United Nations as a nod to Trump’s base. And, in a moment of thinly veiled ass-kissery, cited his criticism of Gary Cohn, a Trump bete noire who had announced his resignation that week as head of the National Economic Council, as the example of his fearless ideological independence. \nIt was the quintessential Limbaugh moment in the Trump era: full of sound and fury and signifying nothing. He was not a Trump lackey, his argument went, but he just happens to believe the guy is the greatest hope for the Republican Party and conservatism in general. Oh, and he’s definitely worried about all that shady international cabal stuff that Steve Bannon and his ilk always warn about. Go ahead, ask him about that “Goldman Sachs Democrat” ― Limbaugh’s description of Cohn ― that the president hates. \nLimbaugh quickly pivoted to a bout of liberal bashing, which ended, naturally, with an allusion to former President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. Such behavior from Limbaugh is as assured as the sun rising in the east, but in the context of President Trump, it had an air of wistfulness to it. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, Limbaugh is in the middle of a four-year contract with his distributor, Premiere Networks (a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, formerly Clear Channel Communications). When Limbaugh inked the deal in August 2016, the prevailing expectation was that it would cover the first term of Hillary Clinton’s presidency. In a news release following the agreement, Limbaugh said he wanted “to be on the air if the Russians find Hillary’s emails.” It was Limbaugh’s constant lambasting of the Clintons in the 1990s that helped propel him into mega-stardom and already his 2016 ratings had spiked 25 percent, according to Nielsen. The band, it seemed, might be getting back together. \nOf course, it wasn’t to be. Instead of having two Presidents Clinton to lob bombs at, Limbaugh instead has a commander in chief who is, arguably, a far better shock jock than he is. Let’s not forget that the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has ridiculed the disabled, immigrants and prisoners of war and also boasted about sexual assault and his ability to execute people in public. \nAnd where once Limbaugh was America’s lodestar of political shock, many of his pronouncements now seem tame when compared with some of his peers in the conservative movement. \n\n\n\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\nRush Limbaugh infamously attacked reproductive rights activist Sandra Fluke in 2012 because of her stances on birth control.\n\n\n\nAngelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog organization that has been highly critical of Limbaugh, sees the radio host as blending in with the crowd somewhat. \n“What has this guy done to adapt? Nothing,” Carusone said. “[Conservative punditry] is like a drug: In order to get your fix, you have to keep escalating a little bit.”\nTake Limbaugh’s response to the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the ensuing gun control activism by a number of the survivors. The student activists, Limbaugh insisted, were mere puppets of the Democratic Party. \n“Everything they’re doing is right out of the Democrat Party’s various playbooks. It has the same enemies: the NRA and guns,” he fumed.\nAs distasteful as such comments may be,\xa0they were pretty standard lines among the conservative green room set ― Bill O’Reilly, for example, made similar remarks. \n\n\n\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_repeating_dynamic_display\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93482077\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["repeating_dynamic_display"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n          }\n\n          adSetInView(\'D\');\n          \n          \n          var args = [\'728\', \'90\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.repeating_dynamic_display\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'repeating_dynamic_display\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n\n\nCompared with other prominent conservatives, however, Limbaugh’s comments were downright tepid. Conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, tweeting news about students being distraught over the Florida Legislature voting down new gun control laws, joked that the development was the “worst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs.” David Clarke, a far-right pundit and former Milwaukee sheriff, said his father would have “backhanded” Parkland student activist Emma Gonzalez. \nMost interesting was conservative radio host Laura Ingraham’s taunting of shooting survivor and activist David Hogg, because it was such a Limbaugh thing to do. After all, Limbaugh’s earliest national controversy, arguably, involved picking a fight with a teenager, namely when he compared President-elect Clinton’s 12-year-old daughter, Chelsea,\xa0to a dog in 1992.\xa0It’s more than 25 years later and El Rushbo and his merry band of “dittoheads” ― his affectionate name for his listeners and supporters ― are both id and ego of the conservative movement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump\'s administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut another way, if Limbaugh’s role in American conservatism has been to stand athwart history yelling\xa0“slut,”\xa0then it’s pretty safe to say: mission accomplished. Limbaugh’s brand of boorish, headline-grabbing conservatism has intertwined itself with the right-wing firmament as intricately as trickle-down economics and Vineyard Vines ties. \nThe question, now that Limbaugh’s schtick is indistinguishable from contemporary conservative punditry, is whether he can survive in a world of his own making. \nThe most obvious answer is yes. Despite declining listenership, Limbaugh still attracts some 14 million listeners every day, the most in talk radio. There is simply no world where having that much of an audience doesn’t guarantee a person a significant amount of clout.\nYet from a historical standpoint, Limbaugh’s stature is diminished. In the 1990s, he helped pave the way for a brash form of conservative media that mirrored what figures like Pat Buchanan were doing with activism and Newt Gingrich with the government. Limbaugh accomplished this first as an attack dog for President George H.W. Bush ― who was about as saucy as a Dixie cup of Vaseline ― and then as a foil to President Clinton ― whose somewhat saucier private life provided the perfect fodder for Limbaugh. In his 1996 book, Hot Air: All Talk, All the Time, media columnist Howard Kurtz described Limbaugh as “talker-in-chief of the opposition party.”\nBy the George W. Bush administration, Limbaugh was a fixture of Republican politics and a conservative thought leader ― like some kind of belligerent Heritage Foundation. While articles about Limbaugh in the early 1990s tended to portray him as a political showman, by the 2000s he was being regarded as a veritable political force. Limbaugh interviewed Vice President Dick Cheney on several occasions, with Cheney saying\xa0in 2009 that the Republican Party needed to be more like Limbaugh and less like Colin Powell, the former secretary of state to George W. Bush who later endorsed Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. \nLimbaugh’s decline began during the Obama administration. Indeed, his 2016 contract helped stanch the bleeding of a not-so-great eight years, in which he saw his listenership decline and sponsors flee after he called reproductive rights activist Sandra Fluke a “slut” in 2012. Notably, Limbaugh’s new salary wasn’t disclosed after his 2016 contract was signed, either officially by iHeartMedia or via leaks to the press, suggesting that it had declined since his whopping eight-year, $400 million deal in 2008.\nNow, with Trump in office, Limbaugh’s political clout isn’t what it was, and a number of operators in Trump world worry the president is leaving a lot of political capital on the table. \n“I love your show, and whenever I can, I listen a lot,” Trump told Limbaugh in a mostly amiable April 2011 interview when he was mulling a presidential bid. (Notably, the interview began with Trump pledging $100,000 to a charity Limbaugh supports, an interesting move from a future candidate who would make so much of the Clinton Foundation’s ethical propriety.)\nYet Limbaugh’s status isn’t near as robust as that interview may have predicted. Advertisers remain wary of his program. (The ones that remain are your standard conservative smorgasbord of gold products, various security systems and other things to make you very, very afraid.) \nMoreover, conversations with officials in and around the White House suggest that Limbaugh doesn’t factor seriously into Trump’s voracious media diet (outside of Limbaugh’s occasional hits on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program) or into the comparatively meager media strategy that originates in this notoriously impulsive president’s White House. Vice President Mike Pence has appeared on Limbaugh’s show, but Trump has yet to as president. \n“Unfortunately, conservative talk radio is generally ignored by most operatives in Trump world and in the larger Republican Party that I know,” one Trump operative with close ties to the White House and Trump’s re-election campaign told HuffPost on the condition of anonymity so as to not alienate political allies. “It’s a shame, because conservative talk is in many ways a larger and more powerful platform than even Fox News.”\n\n[Conservative punditry] is like a drug: In order to get your fix, you have to keep escalating a little bit.\nAngelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America\n\nJane Hall\xa0― a former media reporter for the Los Angeles Times, erstwhile contributor to Fox News and currently a professor of journalism and media studies at American University’s School of Communication ― sees Fox News, which in many ways Limbaugh presaged, as elbowing him out of the way a bit. \n\n\n\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_repeating_dynamic_display\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93482077\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["repeating_dynamic_display"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n          }\n\n          adSetInView(\'D\');\n          \n          \n          var args = [\'728\', \'90\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.repeating_dynamic_display\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'repeating_dynamic_display\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n\n\n“I think Hannity has got the juice because everyone thinks Trump talks to him 12 times a day,” Hall said of the Fox News host, pointedly asking whether “Trump feels the need to call in to Rush Limbaugh.” \xa0\nThough Limbaugh leads the nation among talk show hosts in daily listeners, the close No. 2 on that list, tellingly, is Sean Hannity, whose daily program attracts only half a million fewer people.\nWJNO, the Palm Beach station from which Limbaugh broadcasts, referred HuffPost to Premiere Networks, which declined to comment on the record. The White House did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment. However, given Limbaugh’s mostly rosy treatment of the 45th president, there’s little reason for it to give him much thought.\nLimbaugh has prodded the president here and there. His aforementioned critique of Cohn being one example, his response to Trump signing an omnibus spending bill earlier this year another. Yet his treatment of the divisive commander in chief has been overwhelmingly supportive, if not downright obsequious. A search through Limbaugh’s archives dating back to Trump’s inauguration yields transcripts with headlines like “The Swamp’s Original Mission (Get Rid of Trump) Has Failed,” “The Trump Investigation Hoax Unravels” and “Don’t Believe a Thing the Media Says About Trump. ”\nIt’s all very … boring, and one wonders whether Limbaugh ― who described himself as an “entertainer first and a conservative second” in 1989 ― would offer his kingdom for a President Clinton, or at least a Democratic commander in chief. One suspects he will when contract negotiations come around in 2020. \n“In a weird way, I don’t think he can keep up anymore,” said Carusone, who led a movement to have sponsors boycott Limbaugh’s show after his comments on Fluke. “How do you keep up with [misogynistic pundit and conspiracy theorist] Mike Cernovich, who is reading conspiracies off of 4Chan? I don’t think you can.” \n\n\n\n470\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Will Democrats Back A Former Bush Official Who Hates Trump As Much As They Do?',
  'body': "\nRichard Painter, an ethics lawyer in former President George W. Bush’s administration, has earned a reputation as a resistance hero with his sharp criticisms of the current White House occupant, Donald Trump. He’s amassed a large audience on Twitter ― nearly half a million followers ― and he appears often on cable news shows to make the case that Trump has violated ethics laws, abused his power and obstructed justice during the Russia investigation.\nUnlike most #NeverTrump Republicans, Painter is doing more than speaking out against the president’s alleged transgressions ― he’s putting his money where his mouth is and running for office in Minnesota.\nThere’s only one problem: Painter has chosen to run in the Aug. 14 Democratic primary against Sen. Tina Smith, the state’s former lieutenant governor who replaced Democratic Sen. Al Franken after he resigned early this year amid sexual misconduct allegations.\nPainter’s campaign will test whether Democratic voters are willing to support a one-time Bush administration official who hates Trump as much as they do.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nPainter, 56, worked in the White House as chief ethics lawyer from 2005-2007 before he left to teach at the University of Minnesota. He describes himself as a centrist who doubts there is a place for him in the Republican Party the age of Trump.\n“Today’s Republican voters are just not receptive to my views on a lot of issues,” Painter told HuffPost. He added that “to run as an independent in this race, it almost certainly would have handed the Senate seat to the pro-Trump Republican.”\nDemocrats will agree with much of his campaign platform. Painter views climate change as an existential threat to the planet and opposes Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Accord in global warming. He supports “reasonable gun regulations” and even “a responsible path” to single-payer health care.\nHe believes decisions about marriage and abortion are “strictly personal and none of the government’s business.” He disagrees with the tax cut measure the GOP pushed into law late last year because it blows a hole in the federal deficit.\nWhat raised his profile has been his pointed critiques of Trump’s ethical failings.\nLast year, as vice-chair of the liberal Washington watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, he helped file a lawsuit that argued the president was violating the Constitution by not fully divesting from his business properties that take in rent and other payments from foreign governments.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nTom Williams via Getty Images\n\n\nTina Smith took over the Senate seat fellow Democrat Al Franken gave up earlier this year. She now seeks to hold the job in November’s election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne might get the impression that Painter is actually a member of the Democratic Party. But ask him about his party preference and he’ll be quick to criticize policies backed by Democratic lawmakers in his state, as well.\n“I don’t know whether I’m a Democrat. ... Democrats in this state can’t make up their mind what they want to do with the environment,” he said, referring to the backing some party leaders have given to efforts to build Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine.\nPainter also criticized Smith and Minnesota’s other senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, for supporting the repeal of Obamacare’s medical device tax, lamenting that the health care law was “starting to get chopped up” thanks to the influence of special interests.\n“Pretty soon you don’t have anything left,” he said.\nPainter’s stint in the Bush counsel’s office, though, will likely pose problems in his primary race. In a\xa02016 New York Times Op-Ed article,\xa0for example, he wrote that he helped Bush with the nominations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court ― two of its most solidly conservative members who voted against marriage equality, gutted the Voting Rights Act and supported the Citizens United decision that has allowed huge sums of special-interest money to influence elections, to name a few.\nBut Painter now maintains his role was limited to vetting the court nominees for financial conflicts, and not their judicial philosophy.\n“My opinions are quite different to those of the conservative justices, and I have repeatedly disagreed with a number of their decisions,” he said.\nWhile he disagrees with Citizens United ruling, Painter has argued that overturning the “poorly reasoned” decision will do little to stem the flow of unaccountable money in politics. In his 2016 book, “Taxation Only with Representation: The Conservative Conscience and Campaign Finance Reform,” he wrote that fighting to reverse the decision isn’t worth the trouble because lawyers will simply find another way to get around campaign money laws.\nSmith, 60, wants Congress to overturn the 2010 decision in part through a constitutional amendment and in part by enacting legislation to require super PACs and other organizations spending more than $10,000 in an election cycle to disclose the names of their donors.\n“What I don’t like is the strategy of emphasizing just the constitutional amendment,” Painter said. “What it allows politicians to do is check the box ... of supporting an amendment ... that’ll get blocked, and they’ll just keep raking in huge amounts of cash at the same time.”\xa0\n\nWe need to hold the executive branch accountable: the president and everyone working for him.\nRichard Painter\n\nPainter, in contrast to Smith, has been vocal about opening impeachment proceedings against Trump ― an explosive issue that could help him win some votes in a Democratic primary. Whereas most Democratic officials fear that using such rhetoric could backfire by driving Republican voters to the polls in November, Painter has said, “We need to hold the executive branch accountable: the president and everyone working for him.”\nBut Painter’s past comments on abortion rights might raise eyebrows in a Democratic primary. Appearing at a February 2016 conference on conservative campaign finance reform efforts,\xa0he suggested\xa0money from pharmaceutical companies helped lead to the approval of the morning-after pill. He mused that “corporate donors” like health insurance companies would “save money if pregnancies that are likely to lead to serious health issues for newborns are terminated.”\n“Who makes Plan B? Drug companies,” Painter said. “Once again, maybe that’s a good product, maybe that should be on the market, maybe not. But [that’s] a decision for the people, not a decision that should be rammed down anybody’s throat by the drug companies through campaign contributions.”\nA big hurdle Painter also faces will be fleshing out his views on an array of domestic and foreign policy issues that aren’t known to many voters. And, of course, there will be the constant challenge of being labeled a Bush Republican in a Democratic race.\nPainter said he believes voters can look past that latter matter.\n“I’m not sure those labels ― Democrat or Republican ― mean a lot,” he said. “It’s up to whether members of Congress are going to deliver for their constituents or not.\nThis story has been updated with Painter’s comments on contraceptives.\n",

It was inappropriate and inexcusable.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Pardons May Send A Message To Allies Caught Up In Russia Investigation',
  'body': '\nJust weeks after federal prosecutors in the Russia investigation raided the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort last year, President Donald Trump pardoned political ally and fellow “birther” Joe Arpaio.\nWithin days of his personal lawyer’s offices being searched in April, Trump pardoned Lewis “Scooter” Libby of his 2007 perjury and obstruction of justice conviction for his role in disclosing the name of a CIA agent.\nAnd hours after revelations that a former FBI official had turned over a potentially damaging memo to special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump on Thursday morning announced his pardon of conservative activist Dinesh D’Souza.\nSetting the new case apart from the others: D’Souza had actually pleaded guilty to the charges against him ― making his pardon, say Trump critics, a clear sign to the handful of former Trump aides who have pleaded guilty in the Russia probe and are now cooperating with Mueller’s team.\n“The president is sending a blazing signal to his surrogates and associates that they will be rewarded if they stay loyal,” said Lisa Gilbert, head of legislative affairs for the open government group Public Citizen. “The precedent is particularly frightening as the important Mueller investigation into obstruction of justice and collusion continues and seems likely to have ongoing indictments and charges of those in the president’s orbit.”\nA senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied D’Souza’s pardon was a message to anyone. “No. Not at all,” the official said.\nTrump defenders outside the White House said there was no need for the D’Souza pardon to carry a political message because it had already been sent.\n“I thought that was Scooter,” said one Republican close to Trump.\n“What is he supposed to do, not exercise his power because people might misinterpret it?”\xa0asked Rudy Giuliani, a pardon attorney in President Ronald Reagan’s Justice Department and now Trump’s lawyer in the Mueller probe. “If you’re looking at it that way, he already sent that message with Scooter Libby.”\nOne former White House aide, though,\xa0speaking on condition of anonymity, said that “of course” that was the message Trump was sending.\n\nWhat is he supposed to do, not exercise his power because people might misinterpret it?\nRudy Giuliani\n\n“It could be construed that the president will take action, eventually, to take care of those who’ve been targeted because they are associated with Trump,” agreed Sam Nunberg, who had worked for Trump for years before he was fired from the campaign in late 2015. “They are attacking us, all Trump associates, like we’re Mafia.”\nThus far, former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, former campaign deputy chairman Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn have pleaded guilty in Mueller’s probe. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is under indictment and awaiting trial.\nFrom the start of the Russia investigation, Trump has labeled it a “witch hunt.” He has said it is treating him unfairly ― a characterization he has used for the way all three of his politically oriented pardon recipients were prosecuted.\nArpaio was convicted of criminal contempt of court for refusing to stop racially profiling people he thought looked like illegal immigrants when he was sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.\nLibby was tried and convicted in the case of Valerie Plame, a former CIA agent whose name was leaked to the media by the George W. Bush administration after her former diplomat husband cast doubt on the White House’s claim that Iraq had sought nuclear material.\nD’Souza pleaded guilty in 2014 to asking associates to make donations to a Senate candidate, and then reimbursing them ― thereby exceeding campaign finance limits.\nHe, like Arpaio and Trump, for years trafficked in the racially charged “birther” lie that former president Barack Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore ineligible to serve in the White House.\nTrump announced his latest pardon on Twitter Thursday morning: “Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!”\nA few hours later, aboard Air Force One en route to Texas, he told reporters: “What should have been a quick minor fine, like everybody else with the election stuff. ... What they did to him was horrible.”\xa0(He added that he was also considering pardoning Martha Stewart, who was convicted of securities fraud, and commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell an appointment to a vacant U.S. Senate seat.)\nThe Department of Justice confirmed that the D’Souza pardon did not follow the established process for clemency ― the same way the Arpaio and Libby pardons had not.\nGiuliani justified Trump’s actions, pointing out that a president has the authority to pardon anyone without using any formal process at all. He added that former President Bill Clinton did worse in the final hours of his tenure by pardoning a fugitive hedge fund manager indicted on tax evasion and wire fraud charges.\n“It sure beats the Marc Rich pardon, my friend,” Giuliani said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Inauguration Charges Dismissed Because Prosecutors Withheld Evidence',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON — A D.C. judge on Thursday dismissed felony charges against 10 individuals arrested while protesting President Donald Trump’s inauguration, finding that the government violated the due process rights of defendants by failing to turn over evidence it obtained from a right-wing media organization. Three of the defendants still face misdemeanor charges.\nD.C. Superior Court Chief Judge Robert Morin found that prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, which is part of the Justice Department, had committed Brady violations by withholding undercover videos that James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas had turned over to the government.\nThe ruling in the case against a group of defendants whose trials were about to begin was made as closing arguments unfolded one floor below in the trial of a separate group of defendants. The government had wanted the charges dismissed without prejudice, leaving open the possibility that the government could try to bring the charges again. But Morin ruled that the charges should be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the government is barred from bringing the charges in the future.\n“I do think it’s a serious violation,” Morin said, adding that it was “not explainable to the court” that the government had misled the court. “Your office represented that was the only video turned over,” the judge said, referring to an undercover video of a planning meeting that hadn’t been disclosed in its entirety.\nIn fact, there were dozens of videos on the drive that Project Veritas turned over to the government, defense attorneys said. At one point, a government prosecutor described the right-wing Project Veritas as a “concerned citizen group.”\n“This undeniable prosecutorial misconduct is a serious governmental abuse of power,” said Scott Michelman, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of D.C. “From the initial overcharging decisions to these latest revelations about the government’s misleading editing of the Project Veritas video, the U.S. Attorney’s office has repeatedly abused its power in a quest to lock people up for exercising their First Amendment rights on Inauguration Day.”\nThursday’s ruling was yet another setback in the government’s messy pursuit of felony charges against defendants swept up in a mass arrest after members of the protest group smashed windows ahead of Trump’s Jan. 20, 2017, inauguration. A jury previously acquitted six defendants who prosecutors admitted had not committed any destruction. Prosecutors announced in January that they were dropping charges against 129 defendants, but said they’d pursue the felony charges against a “core group” of 59 defendants. In the second trial, which began earlier this month, the government alleged that three of the four defendants actually engaged in property destruction.\nIt’s not clear how the ruling will ultimately affect the four defendants currently on trial or the dozens of defendants with charges pending. Closing arguments in the trial of the second group of defendants, which is being overseen by another judge, are expected to wrap up on Thursday.\n\nRELATED...\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Prosecutors Still Trying To Turn Trump Inauguration Protesters Into Felons\n\n\n\n\n\nFeds Use James O’Keefe Video In Felony Trial Of Inauguration Protesters\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Department Drops Felony Charges Against 129 Trump Inauguration Defendants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Trump tweeted a picture\xa0taken in the Oval Office with Kardashian, who has been advocating for criminal justice reform for the last year.\xa0\n“Great meeting with [Kim Kardashian] today, talked about prison reform and sentencing,” Trump announced on Twitter.\xa0\nGreat meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\nKardashian, who has built an empire around her family’s reality show, has recently been more engaged in politics. The 37-year-old businesswoman’s interest in criminal justice seems to have been sparked by a number of high-profile cases of controversial sentences against women.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Kardashian enlisted her legal team to aid in an effort to free Cyntoia Brown. Brown, now 30, was convicted of the 2004 murder of a 43-year-old man who she claimed raped her after she was sex-trafficked at 16 years old. The case elicited widespread outrage when Brown was given a life sentence without eligibility for parole for 51 years.\xa0\n“The system has failed,” Kardashian tweeted in November. “It’s heartbreaking to see a young girl sex trafficked then when she has the courage to fight back is jailed for life! We have to do better & do what’s right. I’ve called my attorneys yesterday to see what can be done to fix this.”\nKardashian has also advocated for Alice Marie Johnson,\xa0a great-grandmother who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense.\xa0\n“Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson,” Kardashian tweeted on Wednesday. “Today is for you.”\nHappy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you 🙏🏼✨— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018\n\n\nJohnson was sentenced in 1996 for helping in a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring, something Johnson said she became involved with after she lost her job and was unable to support her family. In an op-ed titled “Why Kim Kardashian Thinks I Should Be Released From Prison” for CNN, Johnson wrote that her life “began to spiral out of control” after the loss of her son and her divorce.\nKardashian has pushed for months on social media for Johnson to receive clemency.\xa0\n“I made the biggest mistake of my life to make ends meet and got involved with people selling drugs,” Johnson wrote in her CNN piece. “This was a road I never dreamed of venturing down. I became what is called a telephone mule, passing messages between the distributors and sellers. I participated in a drug conspiracy, and I was wrong.”\xa0\nAfter meeting with Trump, Kardashian posted her thoughts about Johnson’s future on Twitter:\nWe are optimistic about Ms. Johnson’s future and hopeful that she —and so many like her—will get a second chance at life.— Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 31, 2018\n\n\nI would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon.

Ava DuVernay,\xa0who directed “13th,” a\xa02016 documentary on mass incarceration, addressed the meeting in a series of tweets along with clips from her film.\xa0\n“I’m down for anyone who can make positive change in a positive way to give it a try.

Specifically, can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies?”\nSanders responded that “as a kid, and certainly as a parent, there is nothing that could be more terrifying for a kid to go to school and not feel safe.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“So, I’m sorry that you feel that way,” a visibly emotional Sanders went on. “This administration takes it seriously and the school safety commission that the president convened is meeting this week... to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids in our schools and to make them feel safe and make their parents feel good about dropping them off.”\nThe White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the question, but according to a report in USA Today,\xa0Benje is from California, and\xa0is in Washington, D.C., covering a sports event for\xa0Time for Kids\xa0magazine.\nMany on social media had a lot to say about the exchange, particularly about the poignancy of the question and Sanders’\xa0emotional response:\nNeed to have more kids attend and ask questions at the WH Daily Press Briefing.

 {'title': 'A Mostly Non-Christian Militia Won 2 Of Iraqi Christians’ Parliamentary Seats. Now Christians Want Trump To Intervene.',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― A mostly non-Christian militia linked to a brutal Iranian-backed paramilitary group secured two of the five seats in Iraq’s parliament reserved for Christians, according to official election results announced Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe militia, known as the Babylon Brigade, doesn’t represent Christians at all, local leaders and international advocates for Iraqi Christians warn. They say the militia’s candidates, though Christian, won only because of help from Shiite Muslims. And Iraqi Christians are calling on President Donald Trump to live up to his statements of concern for Middle East Christians by pressuring Iraqi authorities to invalidate the results. But so far, the Trump administration has said nothing on the issue.\nRayan al-Kildani, a Christian associated with various militias, founded the Babylon Brigade in 2014 when ISIS swept through Iraq and began hunting down religious minorities. Al-Kildani brought together 1,000 fighters and soon became the most prominent Christian in the popular mobilization, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias that fought ISIS with U.S. help. Along the way, he forged close ties with the Badr Organization, a historically brutal armed group that receives support from the Shiite leadership of Iran.\nMost of Al-Kildani’s fighters aren’t Christians, national security experts say, but members of the non-Christian Shabak ethnic minority or Iraq’s Shiite Muslim majority. Al-Kildani’s chief value to the mostly Shiite leaders of the popular mobilization forces was in propaganda. “He’s used like a quisling character to put a Christian face onto these militias,” said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, a think tank focused on Middle East policy.\nAl-Kildani has “nothing to do with the morality of Christ ... [and] does not represent Christians in any way,” the church of\xa0Louis Sako, a top Iraqi priest who’s now a cardinal-designate, said in a statement\xa0last year.\nAl-Kildani didn’t win the parliamentary seats because of support from the Christian community but because of his ties to groups like Badr, his opponents fear. His candidates received thousands of votes from heavily Shiite cities that have no known Christian communities, said Asaad Kalasho, the U.S. representative for the Christian town of Tel Keppe.\n“He did get votes from Christians … [but] there’s no way that he won based solely on those Christian votes,” said\xa0Yousif Kalian, a program assistant at the United States Institute for Peace who has written on Al-Kildani’s militia. “Many [Christians] feel he doesn’t represent their interests largely because of connections to Badr and to Iran.” \nOne Christian party whose representatives had a post-election meeting at the State Department is formally challenging the seat allocation. And\xa0Sako said the results show Christians need to “learn a lesson” about securing political power.\nActivists believe that rather than advocate for the Christian minority, the Babylon Brigade’s representatives in parliament will be most concerned with tipping the scales in favor of the Badr Organization, which secured the second-largest seat total in parliament. Kalasho said he sees the situation as evidence that the entire election was flawed — echoing complaints of irregularities elsewhere that the U.S. has said should be investigated.\nStrong representation, the advocates argue, is crucial to help Iraq’s already struggling Christian community survive. Before the U.S. invasion unleashed waves of violence, Iraq had nearly 1.5 million Christians among its population of 38 million. Now\xa0only about 200,000 are left in the country, most of them in northern villages, the Kurdish region in the northeast and the capital, Baghdad. \xa0\n“We’ve been marginalized by both Kurds and the central Iraqi government over the years. Now it’s Iran,” said\xa0Steve Oshana, the executive director of the nonprofit group A Demand for Action, throwing in a reference to Trump’s favorite geopolitical bogeyman. “Our land has been stolen, our rights diminished, and if we lose legitimate representation in parliament, there’s no coming back for us ... We’ve been bamboozled, and it will take leadership from the administration to make sure it doesn’t lead to our complete marginalization in our ancestral homeland.”\nActivists said a strong response by the U.S. government is the only way to ensure that Christians still have their interests represented and prove that Washington will not tolerate attempts to suppress them. The White House and State Department met with Iraqi Christians worried about al-Kildani at least twice last year, Oshana said. \nMany in the Trump administration, particularly evangelical Christian darling Vice President Mike Pence, have said they want to help Iraq’s Christians. \n“Across the wider Middle East, we can now see a future in many areas without a Christian faith. But tonight, I came to tell you, help is on the way,” Pence proclaimed in October. \nBut the president has repeatedly told aides he wants to wash his hands of the Middle East and avoid pulling the U.S. into its communities’ disputes.\nAsked to comment for this story, the White House,\xa0Pence and the State Department’s office for international religious freedom were all silent. \n',

 {'title': 'Dems, Trump Admin Find Common Ground: Helping Victims Of Myanmar’s Genocide',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ―\xa0Top Trump administration officials and a bipartisan group of powerful lawmakers have formed a tacit alliance that could be the best hope for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled violence and persecution in Myanmar last year.\nThe State Department and the White House have taken striking steps to push Myanmar to punish those responsible for the crackdown. And on Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans have rallied behind measures to increase pressure on Myanmar’s leaders.\nPresident Donald Trump has been largely silent on the Rohingya so far. But the unlikely collaboration on one of the world’s largest human rights crises could result in one of the few major international accomplishments of his time in office thus far — if Trump decides to personally join the effort, that is, and if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stops blocking votes on the issue.\n“We really think this could be a success story for the administration,” said Francisco Bencosme, an advocacy official at the nonprofit group Amnesty International. “There’s been high-level engagement. But at the same time, the buck stops with the president. We haven’t seen President Trump speak out for the Rohingya. Until there’s presidential leadership, we still think there’s room for more.”\nMyanmar’s military and allied Buddhist militias killed and raped thousands of Rohingya last year after Rohingya militants attacked security outposts in August.\xa0Some 700,000 members of the historically demonized ethnic and religious minority group fled from Myanmar’s western Rakhine state to neighboring Bangladesh because of the violence. \nTrump aides have been working to help the Rohingya refugees leave the cramped camps, rebuild their burned-down villages and gain the full citizenship rights they have been denied for decades. In October, the administration cut off U.S. assistance for Myanmar military officials involved in operations in Rakhine, and the following month it declared the assault “ethnic cleansing.” Trump placed sanctions on a prominent Myanmar general involved in the offensive in December. And last month, Reuters revealed\xa0that a State Department team has been gathering Rohingya allegations of abuse that could be used for further sanctions and international prosecution of Myanmar officials. \n“There’s a high level of interest in the administration over this,” Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador for international religious freedom, told The Wall Street Journal\xa0after visiting the camps in April.\nOn Monday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,\xa0chastised Myanmar ally China for watering down a U.N. Security Council statement on the issue. At a refugee camp the next day, U.S. Agency for International Development chief Mark Green said the State Department will provide new policy recommendations to the president later this summer. He also announced $44 million more in U.S. humanitarian aid to feed and house the Rohingya, bringing the total to nearly $300 million. \nThe steps have won the Trump team uncommon praise from Congress, where parallel efforts are in the works. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a leader on the issue who led lawmakers on a trip to the region last year, said he was encouraged by both the State Department’s use of the “ethnic cleansing” label and the tough language from Haley.\n“This is a massive case of horrific ethnic cleansing — and, some would say, a genocide,” Merkley told HuffPost. “It was a horrific assault on these defenseless villages and America should be in the forefront of the world’s action.”\n\n\n\n\nKevin Fogarty / Reuters\n\n\nRohingya refugees line the streets as United Nations Security Council\xa0vehicles pass\xa0outside Kutupalong Refugee Camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, April 29, 2018.\xa0\n\n\n\nMerkley has sponsored a Senate resolution urging the “safe, dignified, voluntary and sustainable” return of the Rohingya to Myanmar. Co-sponsored by six GOP senators, it’s one of two bills on the situation that passed out of the Senate foreign relations committee this spring. The other, sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and supported by 19 other senators, makes similar demands and outlines procedures for pressuring Myanmar by placing sanctions on military officials and reducing U.S. purchases of the jade and rubies that are among its top exports. Both proposals have the support of the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), who went on the trip with Merkley, and are linked to parallel legislation in the House.\nSupport from Trump for those bills could help them overcome opposition from McConnell.\nThe Senate majority leader is a longtime supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, the activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who was held under house arrest by Myanmar’s military until 2010.\xa0McConnell pushed hard for her release, and for the junta to begin loosening its grip on power. Now, Suu Kyi is the most powerful civilian in the country’s government ― but she’s facing major international criticism for her failure to acknowledge the Rohingyas’ suffering or publicly challenge Myanmar’s generals.\nMcConnell has said the U.S. should acknowledge the crisis but be wary of upending the power balance in the country. “Publicly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi — the best hope for democratic reform in Burma — is not constructive,” McConnell said in September, referring to Myanmar by its former name as U.S. officials often do.\nThat argument has some powerful supporters within the State Department, which led an Obama-era policy of limited engagement that involved easing U.S. sanctions on the country as its military rulers made concessions like releasing Suu Kyi. The agency’s top Asia official, acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton, is reluctant to publicly condemn Myanmar or China for fear of reducing U.S. influence over them or weakening Suu Kyi’s position, Trump aides and congressional staffers say.\nThose working for the Rohingya see that thinking as outdated, given Suu Kyi’s track record in recent years. \n“I’m a big supporter of Suu Kyi... all the Rohingya supported her,” said Imam Abdul Malik Mujahid, an American Muslim leader involved in lobbying around the issue. But “she has enough authority and she doesn’t do anything with it. We hope that McConnell will have a second look.” \nA strong statement from the White House might acknowledge that reality and trigger faster, stronger American action. Trump has not publicly spoken about the crisis despite private commitments during his first official trip to Asia last year.\nMerkley believes the lack of a presidential statement creates a global perception of indifference. “If the president doesn’t know about it or, worse yet, knows about it and doesn’t care about it, either one is an enormous failing,”\xa0he said.\nSpokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Sommers II / Reuters\n\n\nAung San Suu Kyi speaks to\xa0a crowd\xa0at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky, Sept. 24, 2012.\xa0\n\n\n\nThe situation may soon get worse because of monsoon season, which often brings cyclones and floods. Humanitarian groups are worried about its impact on the refugee camps in Bangladesh, and the possibility that a fresh catastrophe could exacerbate budding Bengali resentment toward the refugees.\nMeanwhile, Myanmar’s government is dampening hopes of a peaceful return\xa0by aggressively transforming the Rohingyas’ homeland\xa0and limiting supplies of food and medicine to those Rohingya who still live in the country. It has prevented United Nations officials, rights groups and the media from freely exploring the area ― though some have snuck in to document ongoing government crackdowns, and Rohingya have been sharing accounts of arson and worsening poverty through social media. \nTop congressional staff working on the issue discovered the lengths Myanmar’s leaders would go to downplay abuses during a visit this spring, an aide told HuffPost: While they flew over Rakhine state, the windows on the government plane carrying them were blacked out so they could not see burned-out Rohingya villages.\nThat only strengthened the feeling that something needs to change fast, the aide said.\nOfficials and activists hope Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others close to Trump can get the issue on the president’s radar soon, whether by using upcoming State Department reports ― including one on whether the U.S.\xa0believes Myanmar’s actions constitute crimes against humanity ― or just appealing to his political instincts.\nTaking action on Myanmar could allow Trump to depict himself as fixing one of former President Barack Obama’s mistakes. There’s increasing public skepticism\xa0of Obama’s 2012 decision to ease sanctions on Myanmar and stay relatively quiet about the persecution of the Rohingya in hopes of facilitating a transition to democracy. \nThe situation offers Trump a rare chance to win international acclaim by charting a different course on foreign policy from Obama. \nIt’s not yet clear whether the president sees the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Civil Rights Groups Rip Senate For Weak Overhaul Of Sexual Harassment Policy',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― Civil rights groups contend a new Senate bill that is supposed to crack down on sexual harassers in Congress is full of problems and lets lawmakers off the hook too easily.\nThe bill, which quietly sailed through the Senate on Thursday, makes some needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing people claiming sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and an absurd 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union has “grave concerns” that the bill is still too weak to be effective. It narrowly defines sexual harassment as actions that are\xa0“severe or pervasive” and requires that such harassment be “unwanted” (suggesting an alleged harasser could defend himself by claiming “she wanted it”). It lets lawmakers hide past discrimination settlements they’ve paid for with taxpayer money. It does not provide legal representation to accusers, a measure that was included in a similar House-passed bill.\n“Members of Congress should be held accountable for their discriminatory conduct, but instead this bill appears to provide numerous opportunities to evade responsibility, while also failing to offer Senate professional staff the same kind of legal counsel and support that members of Congress receive,” said Vania Leveille, the ACLU’s senior legislative counsel.\nThe ACLU, the National Women’s Law Center and other groups outlined their concerns in a Wednesday letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\nRead the letter here:\n Letter from civil rights groups on Senate sexual harassment bill on Scribd\nThe Senate has had a much harder time overhauling sexual harassment policy than the House, which unanimously passed its bill in early February. Why? Some anonymous male GOP senators did not like a provision in the House bill requiring lawmakers to pay out-of-pocket when they settle a lawsuit accusing them of sexual harassment or discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter three months of inaction, Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) finally hashed out the current Senate bill this week. It passed Thursday on a voice vote.\nLead negotiators of the House bill also said the Senate plan does little to hold harassers accountable.\n“Democrats and Republicans on the House side are disappointed,”\xa0Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Thursday on CNN.\xa0\n“The House passed a very strong bill that protects the victim,” she said. “Hopefully we can iron out some of those differences, because in the end, the balance of power has always been with the harasser and the institution. We want to equalize that so that the victim has protections as well.”\nAides to Blunt and Klobuchar did respond to a request for comment.\nThe next step is likely a conference committee, which involves select lawmakers from the House and Senate going into a room and trying to agree on a final bill. House and Senate leaders will have to name those negotiators.\n\n\n\n\nPHOTO GALLERY\nWomen Who Reported Sexual Harassment\n\n\n\n\n",

  'body': '\nRapper Meek Mill\xa0withdrew from an event at the White House on Friday where he was supposed to meet with President Donald Trump to talk about prison reform.\n“I was originally scheduled to be part of a panel on Prison Reform at the White House to help shed light on the issues within the system,” Mill said\xa0in a statement to NBC News.\n\n\n\n\nIcon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\n\nRapper Meek Mill has said he plans to use his platform to fight for prison reform issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately, the focus turned to the President and Myself which concerned me that it might take away from creating a positive result from today’s discussions,” Mill told NBC. “As a result, I decided not to attend so that the focus would be solely on fixing our prison system. Most importantly I remain fully committed to improving our criminal justice system.”\nThe Friday White House summit\xa0brought together dozens of activists, experts and policymakers to discuss prison reform issues. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the summit, with Pence saying prison reform is a top priority for the administration.\nTMZ reports that Jay Z had a hand in changing Mill’s mind about attending the event,\xa0and called the rapper on Thursday night to say that meeting with the president could hurt Mill’s image and his cause.\nMill was originally convicted in 2008 in a gun and drug case. In 2017, he was arrested again two more times. The 2017 charges, combined with a failed drug test, led to a judge finding Mill in violation of probation. The judge sentenced mill to two to four years in prison, but he was released last month.\nJay-Z, aka Shawn Carter, has been an outspoken supporter of Mill, going so far as to argue on his behalf in a New York Times op-ed in November that “what’s happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day. ... A person on probation can end up in jail over a technical violation like missing a curfew.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJohnny Nunez via Getty Images\n\n\nMeek Mill and Jay-Z in 2012.\n\n\n\n\nSince his release, Mill has become an advocate for prison reform, calling out inequities within the criminal justice system.\n“Although I’m blessed to have the resources to fight this unjust situation, I understand that many people of color across the country don’t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues,” he said in a statement in April.\n\n',

 {'title': 'House Democrats Offer Internships For Students Affected By Gun Violence',
  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats are giving young gun safety advocates an opportunity to spend the summer in Washington exploring whether their activism could lead to a career.\nHouse Democratic leaders on Thursday announced a new gun safety internship program\xa0designed for students from Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a teen gunman\xa0killed 17 people in February,\xa0and other schools that have been affected by gun violence.\nDemocratic caucus chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) and vice chair Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.), as well as Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), who chairs a House task force on gun violence prevention,\xa0and Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) sent a letter to fellow Democratic lawmakers encouraging them to offer summer internships to students who have been advocating for gun safety measures.\n“We have all been impressed with the leadership and passion shown by students around the country on the issue of gun violence prevention,” the lawmakers wrote. “Through efforts like the March for Our Lives, students have been speaking up and demanding action on this issue like never before, and they are an inspiration to many of us.”\nThe internship announcement comes less than a week after 10 people were killed in a shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas.\nThe Feb. 14 Parkland shooting sparked a nationwide conversation on gun violence and prompted survivors, as well as thousands of other students across the country, to embrace gun control activism. The students created the March for Our Lives and #NeverAgain movements to continue public discourse on gun violence well after news coverage of the shootings petered out.\nCrowley said the idea for the internship program arose after the Parkland shooting, but things “kicked into gear” after the Santa Fe massacre.\n“These students have been through something none of us would ever want to experience,”\xa0Crowley told HuffPost. “It’s important that we learn from their experience.”\nAn internship, he said,\xa0“is an opportunity for us to learn from them and for them to learn from us.”\nApplicants will be matched with representatives’ offices based on regional and policy interests, said Lauren French, the Democratic caucus communications director.\n“We want to make sure these phenomenal young people know that public service is an option,” French said.\n',

 {'title': 'Work Requirements Are Paperwork Requirements',
  'body': '\nComplying with a “work requirement” in order to receive federal benefits is about more than just getting a job. \nRepublicans want more adults who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, often called food stamps, to work 20 hours per week or enroll in a training program in order to keep their benefits. People who do work that much could still lose their benefits if they fail to do the additional work of filing documentation of their time. \nThe proposal Republicans offered in the U.S. House of Representatives would reduce SNAP enrollment by 1.2 million over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a major critic of the legislation, has said administrative hassle ― rather than an unwillingness to work ― is an important reason work requirements kicked people off a much smaller program known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\nFood stamps already have work requirements, and they can be a hassle for some of the program’s 40 million beneficiaries. Take Andrew Rhoades of Rockford, Illinois. He’s a 26-year-old with no dependents or disabilities, so he’s exactly the kind of person the government wants to nudge into a job. He’d previously worked in a shipping warehouse, but the position was temporary. Besides, he had plenty of work to do helping take care of his sister’s young children.\nLast year, the state government started requiring Rhoades to turn in a record of his job applications every month in order for him to continue receiving $192 per month in food aid. If he didn’t comply, he could temporarily lose benefits for three to six months. \n“I had to fill them out on a piece of paper and take them to the employment office,” said Rhoades, adding that he had to get rides to the office from his sister. “It was annoying.”\nRoughly 14 percent of SNAP recipients in 2016 were able-bodied adults registered to work or fulfill state-specified job search or training requirements. A narrower group of adults between the ages of 18 and 49, who don’t have minor children and don’t live in an area with high unemployment, must work at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits beyond an initial three-month period.\nThe House bill would make more adult recipients comply with stricter requirements, including monthly reporting of their work activities. About 8 million people, or 20 percent of recipients, could be affected, according to an analysis from the Urban Institute. \nThe underlying bill failed in a vote last week, largely because of an unrelated fight over immigration. Republican leaders could bring it back next month. \nMost food stamp recipients would be unaffected by the proposal because they live in households with children or a disabled or elderly adult ― which can be barriers to holding a job. States generally ask people with disabilities or dependents just to periodically reaffirm that they’re still poor enough to qualify. Even that can be a hassle. \nDicky Neely, 70, previously received $26 per month in SNAP benefits, which he would let accumulate on his electronic benefits transfer card until he had enough for a substantial grocery run. Neely writes novels, but is mainly retired and gets by on Social Security benefits. Earlier this year, the resident of Corpus Christi, Texas, said his SNAP benefits didn’t show up in his account, even though he thought he had submitted his paperwork. He called the Texas Department of Health and Human Services to find out what happened. \n“They said, ‘We got your form, but you didn’t sign it,’” he said. “So they cut me off.”\nHe said the state told him to reapply for food assistance, but he’s not sure it’s worth the effort. “It does help, but man, I’m just so tired of dealing with those people,” he said. \nThe bureaucratic hassle explains why fewer than a third of people eligible for minimum benefits bother to apply. \nImplementing the new work rules could be a challenge for states, too, since they would have to expand job readiness programs that currently serve only 690,000 people. Even after the federal investment in training increases from $110 million to $1 billion annually, by 2028, states would only be able to provide training to 80 percent of the several million food stamp recipients subject to work requirements, according to the CBO.\xa0\n“How is that a bad thing?” Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), one of the main authors of the work requirement provisions, told HuffPost. “I’ll take one victory, one family at a time.”\nRhoades’ case may have been a victory from the government’s perspective. He is a participant in the type of training program that would be scaled up under the Republican bill.\nLast year he said he received a notice from the state that made him think he would lose his benefits if he didn’t get a job. Rhoades lives with his sister, Shannon Joslin, and had been helping feed her kids and get them to school every day, but the state told him his childcare services didn’t count as work. \nThe state’s letter may have been unclear since Rhoades doesn’t live in a county where the strictest work rules are currently in effect. He got a part-time job anyway at the same shipping warehouse where he’d worked before.\nThe state reduced his benefits to $80 a month because of that income. He likes the work fine, but he said his sister and her husband had to rearrange their schedules since he was no longer around to babysit as much. \n“They made me get a job, and that messed everything up for everybody,” Rhoades said. \nJoslin, 31, is a cashier at a gas station and said she works about half as many shifts now that her babysitter is busier. \n“I had to reschedule everything,” she said. “I only work two days a week now because of that.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Briefly Responds To Santa Fe School Shooting Before Pivoting',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump expressed\xa0“sadness and heartbreak”\xa0over the deadly shooting at a high school in Texas on Friday morning.\xa0\nHe spoke for around 90 seconds ahead of planned remarks on prison reform during a summit at the White House.\n“This has been going on too long in our country. Too many years, too many decades now,”\xa0the president said of school shootings. He called the Texas incident\xa0“absolutely horrific.”\nThe attack at Santa Fe High School left at least eight dead, according to local news outlets citing law enforcement. Santa Fe, Texas, is around 35 miles southeast of Houston.\n“To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High, we’re with you in this tragic hour and we’ll be with you forever,”\xa0Trump said.\xa0“My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others.”\n“Everyone must work together at every level of government to keep our children safe,” the president continued. “May God heal the injured and may God comfort the wounded, and may God be with the victims and with the victims’ families.”\n“Very sad day,” the president added. “Very, very sad.”\n“On another note, a very positive note, I’m honored to be here today with so many leaders across the nation who are committed to the crucial issue of prison reform,”\xa0Trump said in an awkward pivot to his planned remarks.\nA shooter has been arrested and another person of interest has been detained, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez announced. A fire alarm prompted students to flee the school, and the situation had been “contained” by late Friday morning, officials said.\nThe total number of injured is not yet known. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is accepting patients from the school.\nTrump reportedly spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and pledged to “provide all appropriate federal assistance.”\nThe incident in Santa Fe marks the 22nd U.S. school shooting of 2018, by\xa0CNN’s count.\nTrump ― who spoke at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention earlier this month alongside Vice President Mike Pence ―\xa0has been sharply criticized for seemingly siding with the gun lobby against those pushing for gun policy reform in the wake of the February massacre in Parkland, Florida.\xa0No major gun reform legislation has been passed during Trump’s administration.\nIn the weeks after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, the president proposed a plan that would arm some school personnel\xa0in an effort to make educational facilities safer. Many in education and law enforcement argued that the president’s plan would have the opposite effect.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'963871341\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n          }\n\n          \n          \n          \n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(){\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\nfunction resize() {\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\n  if ((!ifr &amp;&amp; box.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; box.offsetHeight &gt; 10) || \n      (ifr &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetHeight &gt; 10)) {\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\n    label.style.display = \'\';\n  } else {\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\n  }\n}\nfor (i=0; i&lt;10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'California Moves To Let Schools, Co-workers ‘Red Flag’ Dangerous Gun Owners',
  'body': '\nLawmakers in the California Assembly voted Monday to advance a bill that would authorize employers, co-workers and school personnel to request the temporary confiscation of guns from individuals determined to pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation, AB 2888, would build on California’s existing “red flag” law, passed in 2014 following a deadly shooting spree in Isla Vista. The 22-year-old gunman in that case had reportedly exhibited a number of warning signs before killing six people, and then himself, in the rampage.\nThe current red flag law gives family members, roommates and law enforcement officers the power to petition the court to remove firearms from individuals who have displayed dangerous behavior. Judges then hold a hearing to determine whether to order the gun owner to surrender their firearms and stay away from all guns, typically for a year, although the restraining orders can be extended beyond that based on additional evidence.\nThe new bill would expand the list of people who can file for such restraining orders to include a subject’s employer and co-workers and the staff of a high school or college that the person has attended in the last six months.\n“We’re grappling with this issue of gun violence as a nation,” bill sponsor Assemblyman Phil Ting\xa0(D) told HuffPost. “I’ve never said this is a panacea, but it’s just one of many solutions we have to offer.”\nThe state’s courts have issued around 200 restraining orders to prevent gun violence since the original law went into effect in 2016, according to Ting.\xa0He said his bill would provide additional opportunities to catch troubling behavior.\n“Once you move away from home and you’re an adult, you may not spend time with your family,” said Ting. “You may not have much interaction with law enforcement, but chances are if you’re working, you see your co-workers every day for eight-plus hours a day, and you’re with them not just in the work environment but socially.”\nTing pointed to the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, as a case in which a red flag law ― and specifically this sort of broader statute ― might have been able to save lives. Although the suspect in that shooting, a 19-year-old former student at the high school, had attracted the attention of local authorities on numerous occasions before his attack, school staff had also reported concerning behavior as far back as 2016. Florida is among the nine states with a red flag law and one of the four to have ushered through legislation since the Parkland shooting.\nIn 2016, Ting filed a similar bill to broaden California’s red flag law, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, which began at an office holiday party. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) ultimately vetoed the legislation, calling it “premature to enact a further expansion”\xa0even as the initial law was just going into effect.\nA year later, Ting’s San Francisco area district faced its own mass shooting when a disgruntled UPS employee walked into his workplace and fatally shot three colleagues, before killing himself.\nWhen it comes to school safety specifically, restraining orders aimed at stopping gun violence are only part of the equation, said Amanda Wilcox, legislative chair of the California chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She noted a California law that holds parents criminally liable if they leave their gun where a child can access it and mentioned other resources, like the Brady campaign’s\xa0Speak Up\xa0hotline, that allow students to anonymously report violent threats made by their peers.\n“Practices and law and policies that make homes safer would also keep schools safer,” she told HuffPost.\nWilcox said she supports Ting’s bill and suggested that the relatively few restraining orders issued in the past two years under the original law show that it isn’t being overused, as opponents argued it would be.\n“The standards of proof are high in the law,” she said. “It probably needs to be used more, but also under the law it’s supposed to be a last resort if there’s not another way to remove the guns.”\nWith more time to educate Californians on how the red-flag process works, Wilcox said she’s hopeful these restraining orders will be able to keep more guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.\n“What I don’t want is a case where it could have been used and should have been used and wasn’t, and someone is dead because of that,” she said.\nAB 2888 passed in a 48-25 vote largely along party lines. The state Senate is expected to consider the bill in the coming weeks.\n',

 {'title': 'Fighter Pilot Amy McGrath Wins Democratic Primary In Kentucky Swing District',
  'body': '\nLt. Col. Amy McGrath,\xa0a retired Marine fighter pilot who launched a long-shot bid for Congress with a viral campaign video, won Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.\nMcGrath’s primary opponent, Lexington Mayor Jim Gray,\xa0called McGrath to concede the race just two hours after polls closed,\xa0McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas told HuffPost.\xa0Gray’s campaign manager confirmed the concession call to the Lexington Herald-Leader.\nMcGrath, who will face incumbent Republican Rep. Andy Barr in November, trailed Gray by as much as 40 points when he\xa0entered the race in December, according to her internal polling, but steadily gained ground in the ensuing months with a campaign that sought to paint her\xa0as an outsider running against Gray and the national Democratic establishment.\nMcGrath and Gray hardly differed on the issues. They opposed Barr’s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provides health insurance to tens of thousands of the district’s residents, and both supported expanding the law instead. They were largely aligned on other issues, including support for minimum wage increases and opposition to the sweeping Republican tax cut package that Barr supported in 2017.\nBut McGrath seems to have tapped into the same thirst for new political faces that has pushed newcomers ― especially women ― to victories in Democratic primaries across the country this year.\xa0\n\nThough she targeted rural voters outside Lexington, she also campaigned broadly as a progressive. She favors adding a public option to Obamacare, lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare and increasing federal funding for infrastructure and job programs in central Kentucky. She is in favor of abortion rights, is pro–LGBTQ equality and is\xa0vocally opposed to President Donald Trump’s efforts to ban transgender troops from the military and bar refugees from majority-Muslim nations from entering the country.\xa0\nNow she’ll face Barr, who first won the seat in 2012 and has cruised to re-election twice. Trump won the district by 15 points in 2016, but there have been positive signs for Democrats locally:\xa0Gray won a majority of the district’s votes in his unsuccessful 2016 bid to unseat Sen. Rand Paul (R), and this year Democrats\xa0flipped one state legislative seat\xa0in a special election in a Trump-supporting district. The DCCC added the 6th Congressional District to its list of targets in 2018 as it tries to flip at least 24 seats for Democrats to regain the House majority.\nMcGrath plans to continue her against-the-grain pitch to voters in the general election, Nickolas told HuffPost before the primary vote.\nIf she wins in November,\xa0she will be the first woman elected to represent the 6th District in Congress.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nHow An Outsider Kentucky Democrat Found The Inside Track\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'963871341\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n          }\n\n          \n          \n          \n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(){\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\nfunction resize() {\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\n  if ((!ifr &amp;&amp; box.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; box.offsetHeight &gt; 10) || \n      (ifr &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetHeight &gt; 10)) {\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\n    label.style.display = \'\';\n  } else {\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\n  }\n}\nfor (i=0; i&lt;10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, says it’s not his job to weigh in on his boss’ repeated threats against private e-commerce company Amazon.\n“That’s not in my lane,” Kudlow, who chairs the White House’s National Economic Council, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “I can’t really comment specifically. I haven’t looked at that.”\n“Well it comes under the National Economic Council, doesn’t it?” asked host George Stephanopoulos.\n“Well, I suppose so,” Kudlow responded. “I haven’t really been involved in that discussion. Look, the president is a man of many opinions. It’s up to him. He may be carrying the ball. I can’t really comment on it.”\nTrump has ramped up his attacks against Amazon in recent weeks, accusing the company of avoiding taxes and running a “post office scam.” He has also targeted The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, calling the newspaper a lobbyist organization for the company.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nLindsey Wasson / Reuters\n\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a favorite target of President Donald Trump’s.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, The Los Angeles Times reported\xa0that Trump “personally pushed U.S. Postmaster General Megan Brennan to double the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon.com and other firms to ship packages,” a move the newspaper said would cost the companies billions of dollars.\xa0\nMany of Trump’s claims about Amazon’s business and its relationship with the U.S.\xa0Postal Service are outdated or plainly false, according to the website PolitiFact. Amazon pays taxes in most states, and it has “provided some help to the financial picture of the Postal Service,” according to the agency.\nBut Kudlow, a free market advocate who opened his former CNBC television show “The Kudlow Report”\xa0by reciting the motto, “We believe that free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity,” again declined to push back on the president’s claim that Amazon was costing the Postal Service money.\n“I’ve seen the figures, offense and defense, on that one,”\xa0he said. “To be honest with you, I have seen numbers.

 {'title': 'Georgia Governor’s Primary Highlights Competing Visions For The Democratic Party',
  'body': '\nShould Democrats nominate a candidate based on their record of standing up for progressive values, or their vision for the future?\nAnd should the party court white moderates to implement that vision, or expand the electorate by exciting millennials and voters of color who don’t regularly show up to the polls?\nThose are the questions at the heart of Tuesday’s Democratic primary for governor of Georgia.\nStacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and the odds-on favorite\xa0in the race, is running on a solidly progressive platform and the premise that Democrats do not need to cater to the largely white “swing” voters who have abandoned the party in droves.\nStacey Evans, a former colleague of Abrams’ in the House, is running on ever-so-slightly more moderate policies aimed at capturing just enough Republicans and independents to win. At the same time, Evans has argued that on several key bills, Abrams was too willing to compromise with Republicans, especially in a high-profile 2011 vote to cut the state’s free public college program.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nA Tale Of Two Staceys: Georgia Governor’s Race Highlights Democratic Party Divisions\n\n\n\nIf elected in November, either candidate would be the first woman to govern Georgia. But Abrams’ election would be more historic: She would be the first African-American female governor in the country.\nA host of national liberal groups, Democratic Party leaders and donors have placed their bets with Abrams, whose voting rights work put her on the national map years ago.\nIf, as is likely, Abrams wins the primary, Democrats will have a rare opportunity to test the theory that a candidate of color at the top of the ballot and a turnout-the-base strategy can win in challenging territory. She would face an uphill climb, most likely against one of three deeply conservative Republicans:\xa0Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, Secretary of State Brian Kemp or state Sen. Michael Williams.\nAs a result of the unique nature of Abrams’\xa0candidacy, the national party would likely draw outsize lessons from her performance in the general election, whether that’s fair or not, according to Jeff Hauser, a veteran Democratic strategist who runs the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s Revolving Door Project.\n“The stakes get a little magnified unfortunately when somebody is a historic candidate,” Hauser said. “People will be reading a little too much into the results one way or another, and that’s unfortunate, because white men don’t have to face that.”\n\nWhat is truly radical about Abrams’ campaign is that she is running to the left to grow the base.\nkhalid kamau, South Fulton city councilman\n\nThe policy differences between Abrams, 44, and Evans, 40, are hard to spot. They both support raising the minimum wage, using Affordable Care Act funding to expand Medicaid and eliminating the use of cash bail.\nHowever,\xa0the contrast becomes clearer in the two candidates’ framings of their respective bids.\nAbrams, who founded the nonprofit New Georgia Project to register voters of color in 2014, has focused intensely on strengthening voting rights and expanding the electorate.\nIt’s a theme that Abrams drives home in a two-and-a-half-minute video advertisement that weaves together her parents’ struggles in Jim Crow Mississippi and her own career fighting for voting rights, starting as a 19-year-old speaker at the 1993 March on Washington.\n“Your ability to participate in government, to improve your life, is contingent on your access to the ballot box,” Abrams states in the ad.\nOne of Abrams’ most vocal and generous supporters is Steve Phillips, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and author of Brown Is the New White. Phillips argues that Democrats need no longer bother trying to win the votes of increasingly conservative white voters, when diverse candidates who embrace a civil rights agenda can successfully leverage the power of “the new American majority” ― progressive whites, Latinos, Asian Americans and black voters, especially black women.\nPhillips is married to Susan Sandler, the daughter of two fabulously wealthy liberal donors, providing him with powerful backing to apply his political research.\nPowerPAC Georgia, a PAC affiliated with Phillips’ nonprofit Democracy in Color, has spent $1.5 million on voter engagement to elect Abrams.\nThe outside cash provides Abrams an edge, even though both candidates’ campaigns had brought in about $2.3 million\xa0each as of the end of March. (Evans, who is wealthy from her work winning one of the largest Medicare fraud cases in U.S. history, self-funded most of her haul.)\nAnd from his sizable perch on Twitter, Phillips has praised high-ranking Democrats for backing Abrams ― and lambasted others, including former Vice President Joe Biden, for failing to do so.\nAm I correct in my understanding that @JoeBiden was actually IN Atlanta five days before the primary election and still has not endorsed @staceyabrams? #GaPol— Steve Phillips (@StevePtweets) May 18, 2018\n\n\nBiden aside, Abrams has rallied a truly impressive array of support from national Democratic Party leaders for her bid ranging from Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) both of whom have stumped for her, to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Our Revolution, the progressive group that emerged out of his campaign. Abrams held a\xa0get-out-the-vote rally in Atlanta on Saturday where Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, and Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to then-President Barack Obama, both spoke.\nAbrams’ supporters tend to speak about their enthusiasm for her in terms of the historic nature of her candidacy and the power it has to reshape politics in an increasingly purple state that is about one-third black.\n“What is truly radical about Abrams’ campaign is that she is running to the left to grow the base,” said khalid kamau, a South Fulton city councilman who won his April 2017 race with the help of Our Revolution and the Democratic Socialists of America. (In accordance with the Yoruban African tradition, kamau spells his name with lowercase letters.)\xa0\n“It will transform the state,” he added. “I don’t understand how anybody who lived through Barack Obama could not see that.”\n\n\n\n\nChristopher Aluka Berry / Reuters\n\n\nStacey Abrams speaks at a Young Democrats of Cobb County meeting on Nov. 16, 2017.\n\n\n\nFor her part, Evans is wagering that the story of her rise from a childhood of rural poverty, and her subsequent fight to protect the HOPE scholarship have the power to both excite Democratic base voters as well as some moderates who don’t always back the party.\nIt is a more traditional playbook embodied by former Gov. Roy Barnes, one of Evans’ most prominent backers and the last Democrat to occupy the governor’s mansion in Georgia.\nThe watchword of Evans’ campaign is “hope,” which she employs liberally to describe both her overall mission for the state, and her commitment to HOPE, the free college program that secured her a place in the middle class. \xa0\nThe program is also the greatest point of contention between Abrams and Evans ― a symbol of what Evans claims is Abrams’ shallow commitment to the policies she professes to champion. In 2011, with the program facing a shortfall, Abrams voted for a bill signed by Republican Gov. Nathan Deal that dramatically scaled back the program.\nAbrams argues that with a small minority in the legislature, her participation was essential to limiting the scope of the damage and ensuring that Deal held state pre-K funding harmless. But Evans and many state Senate Democrats thought that Democratic leaders could have held out for a better deal, and to some extent, that no deal at all was better than giving Republicans bipartisan cover for the legislation.\xa0\nIn a 30-second ad narrated by a college-bound black woman, Evans highlighted the disproportionate impact of the HOPE cuts on the state’s African-American residents, citing a statistic that 97 percent of African-American residents lost access to full scholarships as a result of the 2011 law’s higher grade and SAT requirements.\xa0\n“As governor, I’ll fully restore HOPE scholarships ― for all our kids,” Evans concludes at the end of the ad.\nAbrams, by contrast, has proposed something she calls “HOPE 2.0” that would make the program more needs-based, rather than merit-based.\n\n\n\n\nTami Chappell / Reuters\n\n\n\nEvans has also attacked Abrams for failing to disclose to her colleagues that her small business was the recipient of a state contract while she was negotiating with Deal. Abrams, who disclosed her ties to the company on official disclosure forms, maintains that her conduct has both legal and ethical, since she walled herself off from the company’s dealings with the state government.\nIn addition, Abrams has elicited scrutiny for a host of other votes, from a Republican-led gerrymandering bill about which she claims to have been misled, to legislation scaling back early voting, which she says provided financial relief to rural communities without restricting access to the ballot box.\nThe plausibility of Abrams’ explanations notwithstanding, her controversial record as a House Democratic leader has won her her fair share of critics,\xa0among whom are many of the state’s current and former African-American elected officials.\nAbrams critics who have endorsed Evans include former state Senate minority whip Vincent Fort, and current state Reps. Ronnie Mabra, Dar’Shun Kendrick and Keisha Waites.\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) has not formally endorsed Evans, but she donated $1,000 through her campaign fund to the candidate.\nEvans has her own share of less-than-progressive votes, including support for a bill making it easier for the state to take over troubled schools, and legislation that would have eased regulations on debt settlement companies that serve low-income borrowers. (The former became law; the latter went nowhere.)\xa0\nBut Evans does not portray herself as the most progressive candidate in the race, making her voting seem less out of step with her image. If she defies the odds and beats Abrams, it may be due to a sense among some voters that Abrams’ campaign-trail rhetoric simply doesn’t match her record.\n“Abrams wanted to work both sides of the aisle and on some issues you just cannot do that,” said Isaac Hayes III, an Atlanta-based songwriter backing Evans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Just One-Third Of Americans Think Trump Is Successfully Draining The Swamp',
  'body': '\nJust under one-third of Americans believe President Donald Trump has done even somewhat well at fulfilling his promise to “drain the swamp,” a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 8 percent of those polled believe that Trump has done very well at eliminating government corruption, while 24 percent say he’s done somewhat well, 13 percent say he’s not done very well, and 39 percent sat he hasn’t done well at all.\nOne-quarter of respondents say that Trump is more honest than most other politicians in Washington, with 45 percent saying he’s less honest, and 16 percent that he’s close to average.\nOpinions are, unsurprisingly, divided along political lines, although Trump’s opponents are both more unanimous and more emphatic in their distaste for his job performance. About three-quarters of Trump voters say the president has done at least somewhat well in draining the swamp, but just 22 percent saying he’s done very well. By contrast, 81 percent of Hillary Clinton voters give Trump the lowest possible rating for his performance.\xa0\xa0\n(The poll was taken before a sinkhole handed the Trump administration’s opponents an on-the-nose metaphor by opening up on the North Lawn of the White House.)\n\n\n\nAcross the survey, the topline results are almost unchanged since spring 2017, when 30 percent thought Trump was doing well at draining the swamp. Since then, the polling suggests, he’s neither lost the faith of his core supporters nor done much to attract new support.\nThese findings add to the body of evidence\xa0that views of the president’s personal characteristics may be largely ― though not entirely ― baked in, mirroring his\xa0remarkably stable approval numbers.\xa0\nAnd, considerably more than a year into Trump’s tenure in the White House, the poll finds he’s still not viewed as a Washington insider by his supporters or opponents. Just 16 percent of those polled describe him as a part of the political establishment, while 61 percent say he’s more of an outsider.\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 16-18 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.\xa0You can learn more\xa0about this project and\xa0take part\xa0in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls’ methodology are available\xa0here.\nMost surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.\xa0Click here\xa0for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.\n',

They agree with gun owners and police, however, that enforcing the bans will be a challenge.\nIt’s hard to know for sure, but Americans could own as many as 520,000 bump stocks, according to estimates from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Many of the devices are untraceable, in part because they don’t have serial numbers.\nNew Jersey is not the only state having trouble enforcing its ban. In Massachusetts, where residents had until February to surrender their bump stocks, State Police received just three devices. The Bay State’s ban, which passed in November, is a felony.\nThe first reported violation of the bump-stock ban in Massachusetts occurred in March, when police arrested a couple after discovering an arsenal of weapons in their hotel room. The bump-stock charge was one of more than three dozen gun charges in that case.\nBump-stock bans in Florida, Maryland, Vermont and Washington have been approved but have not yet gone into effect.\nConnecticut’s ban has passed both houses of the state Legislature and is awaiting the signature of Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy. Jeremy Stein, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said he doesn’t expect the ban in his state to prompt a flood of bump-stock owners to turn in their devices.\n“Unless the police are getting search warrants to go house by house, there will probably be people who aren’t giving up their bump stocks,” Stein said. “Enforcement will come into play when the police are investigating other crimes, like domestic violence or whatever, and they come across a bump stock. They can tack on another charge.”\nConnecticut State Police are preparing for residents to turn in their bump stocks, said Sgt. Alex Giannone of the Special Licensing and Firearms Unit. But Giannone is not expecting the state to receive many of the devices.\n“I don’t believe this is a widely purchased and popular accessory,” he said.\nStill, when a person does surrender a bump stock, state police will dismantle the device, destroy it with a saw and burn it in an incinerator, he said.\nOne of the main reasons why owners are not turning in their bump stocks to authorities is that there’s no financial incentive attached to many of these state bans, said Mark Pennak, the president of Maryland Shall Issue, a gun rights group that opposed Maryland’s recently passed bump-stock ban.\n“You’re basically telling people to destroy their property,” Pennak said. “If you take someone’s private property, you have to pay for it.”\nPennak said the stiff penalties are unfair.\n“They bought them just because they’re fun to use, and that’s it,” he said. “You’re criminalizing a plastic item, and sending people to prison for three years for it.”\nThe federal government estimates that Americans have spent $96.2 million on bump stocks between 2011 and 2017. These devices can cost from $180 to $425 each.\nMaryland’s ban, which goes into effect in October 2019, does not include a buy-back program. But the one in Washington state does: A section of the new law calls on the Washington State Patrol to establish a year-long buy-back program starting in July, where residents can turn in bump stocks and receive $150.\nDelaware’s proposed bump-stock ban, which has passed the state House and is being considered by the Senate, would include $15,000 toward a buy-back program.\nAnother concern for some gun rights activists is that the state bans do not give enough notice to residents that possessing a bump stock is, in most cases, a felony.\nHawaii’s bump-stock ban, which awaits the signature of Democratic Gov. David Ige, would go into effect immediately and carry a five-year, $10,000 fine upon a conviction. The language of the bill, however, does not include a grace period or any instruction for how residents can dispose of their devices. This sort of vagueness concerns Harvey Gerwig, president of the Hawaii Rifle Association, an affiliate of the National Rifle Association.\n“Nobody knows how to implement this stuff,” Gerwig said. “There’s nothing in the bill that says what will happen.”\nGerwig said he fears that gun owners who don’t closely follow state policy changes and therefore aren’t aware of the ban might be charged with a felony if they are caught using or even possessing the devices.\nVermont’s bump-stock ban does instruct the Department of Public Safety to “develop, promote, and execute a collection process that permits persons to voluntarily and anonymously relinquish bump-fire stocks” before the new law goes into effect in October.\nBut Evan Hughes, the vice president of NRA Foundation Projects at the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen’s Clubs, a gun rights group, said the law is still “virtually unenforceable.”\n“The only way to comply with the law is divest themselves of their property,” he said.\nAllison Anderman, the managing attorney for the Giffords Law Center, a gun control organization founded by former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, the Arizona Democrat who survived a shooting in 2011, acknowledged that enforcing a ban on possession is a challenge. But she emphasized that merely prohibiting the sale of new devices will eventually reduce the number of bump stocks in circulation.\nThe largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, has announced that it will stop selling them on May 20.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department is considering a nationwide bump-stock ban, which has been endorsed by President Donald Trump. ATF is soliciting public comment on the proposal, but it may face a tricky legal challenge: During President Barack Obama’s tenure, the ATF determined that it did not have the authority under the National Firearms Act to regulate bump stocks.\n',

Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday.\nTrump has been using\xa0a cellphone not equipped with top security features\xa0and has rejected repeated attempts by his staff to harden his devices against hackers, Politico reported Monday. The president reportedly uses two cellphones:\xa0one dedicated for his frequent Twitter use and another to make calls. The latter has a camera and microphone — features that security experts warn can be exploited by hackers.\nAccording to the report, the GPS location trackers on both of Trump’s devices have been deactivated. But he has reportedly gone for as long as five months without getting his Twitter phone checked by security experts, posing additional risks of hacking.\nThe significance of compromised presidential communications could be enormous. Trump often uses his cellphone to speak with friends, advisers, former business partners and lawmakers about the Russia investigation and sensitive issues like negotiations with North Korea. His reluctance to secure his personal communications could have already exposed him to domestic or foreign surveillance efforts.\nMost Republicans who spoke to HuffPost about Trump’s phone use on Tuesday said they were not aware of or had not yet read a Politico report concerning his cellphones. Some, like Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), acknowledged that secure phone lines are “something you need to be concerned about.” \nSen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, meanwhile, expressed confidence in the president’s ability to exercise good judgment about how and with whom he communicates. \n“I suspect the president of the United States is sophisticated enough to know what he should or shouldn’t be talking about on an unsecured line,” he said. “We all have unsecured and secured lines, and in the business we’re in, it’s just common knowledge what you talk about and don’t talk about.”\nSome Democrats also shrugged off questions about Trump’s cellphone use. \n“I spoke to him quite a few times on the phone, so I’m sure people were listening in,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) quipped Tuesday. \nHe added that, as a rule, he doesn’t discuss matters over the phone “that I didn’t think I wanted people to hear.” But when asked by HuffPost if he was concerned about the possibility that the president discusses sensitive matters on an unsecured phone line, Manchin said, “I hope he doesn’t.”\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the foreign relations committee,\xa0 said he found the lack of security of Trump’s cellphones “incredibly concerning.”\xa0Murphy succinctly summed up, however, why it barely registered in Trump’s Washington, where a new scandal or feud seems to pop up every day ― developments that may have consumed weeks in past administrations.\n“It’s somewhere in the middle of a list of a hundred things I worry about on a daily basis,” Murphy said.\n',

I have NEVER done anything wrong in my life. Please help me!!”\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nAmerican Josh Holt, 26, posted videos to Facebook on Wednesday that appear to show him begging for his life amid riots\xa0at a Venezuelan prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nRioting has been reported at the Caracas prison, El Helicoide, which is the headquarters of Sebin, the country’s intelligence agency. Videos viewed by Reuters purportedly show prisoners walking around freely inside of the facility demanding their freedom.\n“This has been taken over peacefully by all the political prisoners and all the prisoners who are abducted here, who are tortured daily,” one man is quoted as saying in a video. The man said tear gas and weapons had been fired upon the detainees but that they are holding out to demand their release.\nRioting and violence at Venezuelan prisons, which are notoriously overcrowded\xa0and filled with weapons and drugs,\xa0is not uncommon. In March, rioting and a fire inside of\xa0cells at a Venezuelan police station left 68 people dead.\nThe violence reported this week in Caracas comes days before the country will hold a presidential election. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who is seeking reelection, has some of his top opponents imprisoned inside Helicoide.\nUtah Rep. Mia Love (R) said Wednesday that she has spoken with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and her office confirmed that the prison where Holt is being held was threatened by riots and violence but that he is safe.\n\n“I am extremely concerned about this situation, but have been assured that Josh is safe at this time,” Love said in a statement. “It is time for the State Department to quickly produce a plan of action in order to resolve this situation once and for all.

It was while they were in Caleno’s apartment in a Caracas public housing project that they were arrested, with the police accusing him of stockpiling an assault weapon and grenades.\nHis family has said that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. His mother,\xa0Laurie Holt, speaking to the Deseret News Wednesday,\xa0said his trial was scheduled to start Tuesday but that he was never brought to the hearing.\n“He hasn’t had any justice whatsoever on trumped-up charges that are ridiculous,” she said.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Venezuela tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. will hold the Venezuelan government responsible if anything happens to Holt or any of the other political prisoners.\nPresident Donald Trump announced new sanctions against Venezuela last year and\xa0also called for Holt’s release on humanitarian grounds.\n",

 {'title': 'The Farm Bill Could Be A Huge Blow To Animals',
  'body': '\nAs Congress fights over the latest farm bill, one proposal has animal welfare and food safety advocates ― and even some farm industry groups ― sounding the alarm.\nThey’re opposing\xa0the Protect Interstate Commerce Act, an amendment from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) that they fear could jeopardize thousands of state and local laws regulating food and farming.\nAlso known as the King Amendment, this addition to the\xa0draft farm bill\xa0would ban states from imposing rules on the sale of out-of-state agricultural products if those rules are more restrictive than federal law ― or the law within a product’s state of origin.\nSo what might this look like in practice?\nKing has repeatedly pointed to a proposed California law\xa0that would ban the sale of eggs from hens raised in battery cages — a housing system involving rows of small cages typically deemed inhumane by animal welfare experts. Since battery cages are legal at the federal level, as well as in many states that produce eggs, PICA would bar California’s proposal.\n\n\n\n\nMike Blake / Reuters\n\n\nHens in battery cages at a San Diego County egg farm in 2008.\n\n\n\nBecause the term “agricultural products” is so broad, it’s difficult to tell how far-reaching the legislation would be. Some animal welfare and pet industry groups fear it might even extend to laws aimed at stopping the sale of sick or abused dogs from out-of-state puppy mills,\xa0The Hill reports.\nWhile it’s obvious why many animal welfare advocates would be against PICA, the amendment’s ramifications could extend much further.\xa0A Harvard Law School analysis\xa0found that PICA “has the potential to void thousands of state and local laws concerning public health and safety,” including laws surrounding food safety, packaging and invasive species.\nTake California and Oregon, which both have regulations to prevent the import of plants carrying the glassy-winged sharpshooter, an insect that harms grape crops.\n“PICA may interfere with those states’ ability to enforce such regulations,” the report says. “For example, under PICA a law requiring out-of-state producers to treat agricultural products with pesticides to kill the sharpshooters prior to import arguably places an additional and impermissible condition on them.”\nAnother law that could be voided under PICA, the report says, is a Florida ban on the sale of citrus fruit tainted with arsenic.\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n\nTwo out of nearly 1,000 dogs rescued from a West Virginia puppy mill in 2008.\n\n\n\nThe potentially widespread consequences of PICA are why such a diverse set of interests are aligned against it. Groups ranging from Farm Sanctuary\xa0― which promotes animal welfare and veganism ― to the Alabama Poultry Growers Association\xa0are urging Congress not to pass the farm bill with the amendment attached. Environmental groups, food safety advocates, workers rights organizations and numerous individual farmers and state lawmakers have also expressed opposition.\nAnd some legal experts fear that the act could even wind up changing the way states can regulate farming within their own borders — not just the sale of out-of-state products.\nKing has said that it’s not his intention for it to work that way.\n“If California, or any other state, wants to regulate how products are made within their borders, they can do so,” he said in an\xa0April press release about the amendment.\nBut Rebecca Cary, senior staff attorney at the Humane Society of the United States, told HuffPost things might not be so clear-cut.\xa0The reason? PICA’s vague wording opens it up to extremely broad interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nYves Herman / Reuters\n\n\nPregnant pigs in gestation crates, also known as sow stalls, at a farm near Brussels, Belgium, in 2012.\n\n\n\nShe explained in an email: “In-state production laws could be vulnerable because the amendment places conditions not on the SALE of agricultural products, but on the production or manufacture of agricultural products that are sold in interstate commerce.”\nOne potential victim of PICA, the Humane Society warns, is\xa0a landmark Massachusetts law\xa0to prohibit the intensive confinement of animals through systems like\xa0pig gestation crates.\n“Because most Massachusetts producers ultimately sell at least some of their products in markets outside of the state, those could be considered impermissible standards under King’s amendment,”\xa0Cary said.\nKing wrote a similar amendment to the farm bill back in 2014, but it didn’t make it into the final version. Congress passes a farm bill about every five years ― the 2014 bill was passed late ― that sets policy for farms, food and other areas within the scope of the Department of Agriculture.\nThis year, the GOP is struggling to get votes for the bill,\xa0in part because of disputes over a provision that would drastically limit access to food stamps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Judge Orders Texas To Make Voter Registration Easier When Updating DMV Info',
  'body': '\nA federal judge gave Texas\xa045 days\xa0to implement a new process for taking voter registrations and changing registration information when residents use a state online information portal, after ruling the state’s current practice was illegal.\nU.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia on Friday ordered Texas to change its online process by July 2 so that people can simply check a box online indicating that they wish to register or update their voter registration when they use the Texas Department of Public Safety’s online portal to renew their driver’s license or change their address. The order came as part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of four Texas voters whose voter registration information was not updated when they went online to update\xa0the address on their driver’s licenses.\nIf someone wanted to register or update their voter registration,\xa0the state required they print out, sign and mail in a separate form. Texas officials argued that state law required any voter application to be signed, but the challengers said that the state’s practice violated the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer people the opportunity to register to vote and to use the information in a driver’s license application simultaneously as a voter registration document if they want to register.\nFrom\xa0 2013 to 2015, over 1,800 people complained they were unable to register to vote when updating their information online. There are over 15 million registered voters in the state.\nGarcia sided with the challengers and permanently blocked Texas from continuing its current practice for online driver’s license renewals or changes of address. Lawyers for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said in a court filing Monday they were appealing Garcia’s order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. They asked Garcia to pause his order while the appeals court considered their request.\nBeth Stevens, the voting rights director at the Texas Civil Rights Project, which brought the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs, praised Garcia’s decision.\n“It’s long past time for the State to stop wasting time and resources defending its unlawful violation of this pivotal voting rights law,” Stevens said in a statement. “We urge State officials to come to the table and work with us to implement the court’s plan which will ensure that not one single voter loses their opportunity to vote.”\nGarcia also gave the state two weeks to submit a proposed educational campaign using three forms of media to inform the public about the changes to the online process. He also ordered the state to provide annual updates to the Texas Civil Rights Project, including information on the number of voter registrations that resulted from online driver’s license renewals and change of address applications and the number of complaints it received about the process.\xa0He ordered the state to conduct monthly quality control tests until 2019 to ensure continued compliance with his order.\nGarcia first ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in April and asked the plaintiffs and Texas officials to propose remedies. State officials largely declined to offer a solution last week\xa0and objected\xa0to what the Texas Civil Rights Project proposed. In a court filing, they said it would be impossible to implement a new system in 45 days because a new vendor was taking over managing the state’s website on Sept. 1 and it would take at least 90 days to change the system. They also argued that if it intervened, the court would infringe on the authority that the U.S. Constitution gives states to regulate their elections. \n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nJudge Finds A Voter Registration Process In Texas Violates Federal Law\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is suing Ohio to strike down the state’s congressional map, saying it was intentionally drawn to so egregiously benefit Republicans that it violates the Constitution. \nSince 2012, Republicans have consistently won the same 12 of Ohio’s 16 congressional seats, while winning between 51 and 59 percent of the state’s popular vote. The suit alleges that Republicans maintain this remarkable advantage because they controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and worked in secret to draw a map to guarantee just that outcome each year.\nThe suit was filed Wednesday in federal court on behalf of 16 voters in each of the state’s congressional districts, the Ohio chapter of the League of Women Voters and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a labor and civil rights group.\nThe lawsuit underscores a growing confidence among voting rights groups over the last few years in bringing challenges to congressional plans that Republicans have benefited from since 2012. The Supreme Court has never said whether an electoral map can be so partisan that it violates the Constitution, but\xa0it is expected\xa0to rule in two cases that make that argument\xa0in June.\xa0A ruling setting constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering could profoundly affect American politics by requiring lawmakers to draw districts that are more competitive.\n\n\n\n\nOhio secretary of state\n\n\nThe ACLU says Ohio’s congressional map violates the Constitution because it deprives Democrats of the ability to elect a candidate of their choice and treats them differently from Republicans.\n\n\n\nTwo more congressional elections are due to take place under Ohio’s current map before the next round of redistricting in 2021. Even though litigation can move very slowly, the ACLU hopes to have a new map in place for the 2020 congressional elections.\nAlora Thomas, an attorney with the ACLU, said her organization felt encouraged to bring the suit after multiple rulings in lower courts blocking electoral maps in Wisconsin and North Carolina on partisan grounds. (Those rulings are currently paused while the Supreme Court considers appeals.) In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s congressional maps as too partisan for the state Constitution. A challenge to Michigan’s congressional map on partisan grounds is also before a federal court.\n“Because courts are really now open to taking a look at this issue, and it looks like they’re going the right way and finding partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional, the question becomes, ‘Well, where else is there a problem and is it something that needs to be addressed now?’” Thomas told HuffPost. “Ohio is one of the most gerrymandered states in the country.”\nAn analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found that Ohio’s congressional map has some of the most severe partisan bias in the country and accounts for between two and three additional GOP seats in the current Congress.\nThomas said the ACLU didn’t want to wait until Ohio got a new congressional map in 2022, because Ohio residents have already spent nearly a decade voting under a map the group believes is unconstitutional. A fairer map in place before the next round of redistricting, Thomas said, could ensure that the map for the subsequent decade is also fairer. Ohio voters also recently approved a ballot initiative to change the way redistricting is done in the state, a move that advocates hope will rein in excessive partisan gerrymandering.\nThe suit argues that the Ohio map violates the First and 14th Amendments,\xa0as well as Article I of the Constitution. The map violates the First Amendment, the suit says, because it amounts to an effort to “skew electoral outcomes to freeze their advantage and insulate their majority from changes in voter preferences.” It violates the 14th Amendment, the ACLU says, because lawmakers drew the map intentionally to disfavor Democratic voters in the state without a legitimate reason to do so. The ACLU also argues that in drawing such a severely gerrymandered map, Ohio lawmakers exceeded the power the Constitution gives them to regulate elections.\nThe case will hinge significantly on what the Supreme Court decides by the end of June. During oral argument in two partisan gerrymandering cases this year, the court seemed willing to allow some amount of politics in redistricting, but appeared closely divided on whether it was possible to determine if partisan gerrymandering could go so far that it violates the Constitution. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote in a 2004 case that such a standard might exist, is seen as the critical swing vote in the case, and advocates have offered a number of standards with the hope that he might find one he likes.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich (R), who signed the state’s congressional map into law in 2011, is named as a defendant in the suit. But Kasich has recently been an outspoken opponent of partisan gerrymandering, and was one of a number of Republican elected officials who urged the Supreme Court in October to step in and do something about gerrymandering.\nIn a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Kasich and other Republican officials took a position similar to what the ACLU is arguing in the Ohio case, saying that partisan gerrymanders are “repugnant to the Constitution” and violate the First and 14th Amendments.\nUPDATE: 2:50 p.m. ―\xa0Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R), one of the state officials named as a defendant in the suit, criticized the challenge.\n“If the way the congressional lines were drawn was such an issue for the ACLU, A. Philip Randolph Institute and League of Women Voters, why did they wait six years to file a lawsuit challenging the maps?”\xa0Husted said Wednesday in a statement. “These groups should respect the will of Ohio’s voters who overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment earlier this month that established a new, bipartisan process for drawing congressional districts starting in 2021.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nOhio Voters Pass Gerrymandering Reform Measure\n\n\nRepublicans Got Greedy With Gerrymandering.

 {'title': 'A Judge Ruled One Immigrant Had A Right To A Hearing. What About All The Others?',
  'body': '\nA federal judge has issued a ruling in a single immigrant’s legal case that could foreshadow problems for the Trump administration’s policy of detaining unauthorized immigrants indefinitely without a hearing, charge or trial.\nThe government has 14 days to hold a bond hearing for Augustin Sajous, a 60-year-old originally from Haiti who has been held in immigration detention since September, Judge Alison J. Nathan ruled Wednesday in New York.\xa0Authorities must release him unless they can provide convincing evidence he is a flight risk or a danger to the community, the judge ordered.\xa0\nNathan’s ruling applies only to Sajous. But it’s a key part of a bigger fight over a question affecting millions of people: How long can the government detain immigrants without allowing them to go before an immigration judge to challenge their detention? \nThe answer to that question used to be “six months” — at least according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled on the matter in 2013. Then, this February, the Supreme Court overturned the circuit court’s ruling, clearing the way for the government to continue detaining immigrants without hearings. \nThe Supreme Court ruling was limited: It said only that immigrants had no specific right under immigration law to a bond hearing every six months. It didn’t rule on whether holding immigrants indefinitely without a bond hearing was constitutional.\xa0\n\nIt feels almost impossible to fight your immigration case from detention.\nAugustin Sajous\n\nNathan’s ruling offered an answer to that constitutional question — but only for Sajous. The continued detention of Sajous “without access to a bond hearing is unreasonable, and thus unconstitutional, as applied to him,” she wrote. His more than eight-month detention stemmed from two offenses that were each punishable by up to 30 days in jail, she noted, meaning he has already been detained “over four times longer than the maximum sentence he faced for his underlying offenses.”\nThe court did not create a definitive standard for when the government must provide a bond hearing.\nNow Sajous’ case — or a similar one, if the Department of Justice doesn’t appeal — is likely to work its way up through the courts. That means the Supreme Court will likely be forced to weigh in on the question it avoided answering in February.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling or whether it plans to appeal. \nSajous, who has lived in the U.S. on a green card since age 14 and has raised a family here, could be out of detention by early June. Although he is a legal permanent resident, Sajous, who has had depression and been homeless in recent years, is subject to deportation because of two misdemeanor convictions from 2015 for bending fare cards to use the New York subway without paying. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him in September, and he has remained in detention since. \n“It feels almost impossible to fight your immigration case from detention,” Sajous said in a statement released by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which represented him. “I just want the chance to explain to the judge that I’m not a flight risk. When you’re free, it’s a lot easier to fight your case. A bond hearing is my chance.”\nNathan’s ruling means he’ll get one. But the NYCLU estimates that unless courts intervene, in the next year about 200 people in New York state may be detained for longer than six months without a bond hearing.\xa0\nThe\xa0other immigrants being held without hearings will likely have to sue the government in federal court to get their own — or to wait and hope for the Supreme Court to rule their detention unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Senators Unveil Bill To Crack Down On Their Sexual Harassment',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― After months of delays by Republicans, senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Wednesday that cracks down on sexual harassment in their ranks.\nThe bill,\xa0hashed out by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), makes badly needed updates to the Congressional Accountability Act, a decades-old law that set up the process for handling workplace complaints about harassment and discrimination on Capitol Hill. It eliminates rules forcing victims of sexual harassment to undergo counseling, mandatory arbitration and a 30-day “cooling off” period before taking a complaint to court.\nHere’s a section-by-section overview of their bill.\n CAA Reform Act Sec by Sec FINAL by jen_bendery on Scribd\nThe most contentious provision in the bill is its requirement that lawmakers pay out of pocket for sexual harassment and discrimination settlements.\nThat language was part of similar legislation that easily passed the House in early February.\xa0But when the House bill arrived in the Senate, some anonymous male GOP senators opposed that provision and stopped the bill in its tracks.\nIn the months that followed, senators who had been demanding action grew agitated.\xa0All 22 female senators\xa0from both parties ripped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for not making the bill a priority. Every male Democratic senator ― plus Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who co-sponsored a sexual harassment bill with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) ―\xa0wrote to McConnell\xa0urging him to do something.\nThe Senate’s delays looked particularly bad as the Me Too movement hit Capitol Hill last fall and triggered a series of sudden retirements by lawmakers accused of sexual misconduct. One of them, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), quit without repaying $84,000\xa0in taxpayer money he spent on a sexual harassment settlement.\nBut Wednesday’s breakthrough means the bill has a good chance of moving ― and moving quickly. Blunt and Klobuchar have support from their party leaders, and they presented their proposal to their respective caucuses on Tuesday afternoon. Barring any last-minute objections, Blunt suggested the Senate could vote on the bill by the end of the week.\n“With this agreement, both parties are coming together to update the laws governing how the Congress addresses workplace claims and protecting staff and others from harassment,” McConnell and Schumer said in a joint statement. “We’re optimistic that after our members review the legislation, this bill will pass the Senate in short order.”\nCongress clearly needs to deal with this. Four out of 10 female congressional aides say sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill, according to\xa0a 2016 CQ Roll Call survey. The same survey found that 1 in 6 said they had been personally victimized.\nNotably, the Senate bill takes steps to prevent another Farenthold-type situation. It authorizes withholding compensation from a lawmaker if he or she doesn’t repay a harassment settlement initially paid out with taxpayer money. If the lawmaker hasn’t paid up within 180 days, the Treasury Department is authorized to take money out of that lawmaker’s compensation or annuity.\nThe bill now heads to the House, where lawmakers may not like the changes made by the Senate.\xa0Both chambers will have to agree on its final language before it can go to President Donald Trump to become law.\n\n\n\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\nIt took months, but Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) have hashed out a deal to require lawmakers to pay out-of-pocket for sexual\xa0harassment settlements.\n\n\n\nIt’s not entirely clear how the Senate plan differs from the House bill, but Klobuchar said there are dozens of changes. One difference is that the House bill proposed a 45-day limit on when a staffer can bring a federal court case against a member of Congress allegedly harassing him or her. The Senate proposal doubles that time frame to 90 days.\n“There were many, many, many things we worked on,” Klobuchar said. “We were able to negotiate them one by one and get, what I think, is a very good bill.”\nIt’s still a mystery which GOP senators opposed the provision requiring them to be personally liable for sexual harassment settlements.\xa0Under the current system, the U.S. government ― i.e., taxpayers ― is considered lawmakers’\xa0employer and foots the bill for any settlement involving a lawmaker or an aide.\nBlunt, for one, got snippy Tuesday when asked if his bill would require staff and members of Congress to pay out of pocket for settlements. That is the case under the House bill. But Blunt said the Senate bill would only apply to lawmakers.\n“Non-members would still be covered by their employer ― like every other employee in America is for their actions,” he told reporters.\nThis article has been updated to reflect that the bill has been introduced.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) helped\xa0cut a deal on legislation that\xa0makes lawmakers more accountable for sexual misconduct at work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

By Thursday, he’d completely lost interest. And about two months later, he was the speaker at the NRA convention in Dallas.”\nCooper referred to a statistic reported Friday by The Washington Post that more people have been killed\xa0in U.S. schools\xa0this year than people serving in the military.\nKelly responded: “It’s ridiculous that these kids have to live in a country, these kids in Santa Fe or in Parkland or 22 other places around the country just this year alone, that they have to assume that kind of risk when they go to school.”\nHe added: “To see our elected leaders do nothing over and over again, it’s just an incredibly sad situation.”\nCheck out the rest of what Kelly had to say in the video above.\n',

 {'title': 'Super PACs That Meddled In West Virginia’s Senate Primary Didn’t Receive A Penny From West Virginians',
  'body': '\nTwo outside groups that successfully meddled in West Virginia’s Republican Senate primary this month by spending millions of dollars on advertising were funded entirely by donors from outside the state.\xa0\nThe super PACs\xa0Mountain Families PAC\xa0and Duty and Country\xa0revealed in reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday that they were funded by major donors affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, respectively.\nNeither group received a single cent from West Virginians.\xa0\nThe filings show how big donors, party leaders and consultants can dramatically alter the outcome of elections without disclosing who funded the ads until after the election is over. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morissey, the winner of the May 8 Republican primary, was subject to far fewer attacks from the super PACs than his two opponents,\xa0ex-con coal baron Don Blankenship and Rep. Evan Jenkins.\xa0\nMorissey will face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in November in a race that will be critical to control of the U.S. Senate.\xa0\nMountain Families PAC, which raised $1.4 million from the McConnell-controlled Senate Leadership Fund, aired ads blistering Blankenship for his role in the deaths of 29 miners in the disaster at Upper Big Branch in 2010. The campaign led to an ugly fight between Blankenship and McConnell, culminating in Blankenship using racist attacks against McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, and infamously calling the majority leader “Cocaine Mitch.”\xa0\nAfter Blankenship’s third-place primary finish, Senate Leadership Fund didn’t exactly hide its excitement.\xa0\nThanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen pic.twitter.com/TV1ETgQdmu— Team Mitch (@Team_Mitch) May 9, 2018\n\n\nSenate Leadership Fund,\xa0based in Washington, has raised nearly $24 million this election cycle. Just one donation\xa0― a $5,000 check from Swanson Industries in August ― came from West Virginia.\xa0\nDuty and Country aired ads attacking both Morrisey and Jenkins,\xa0but Jenkins, a Democrat-turned-Republican who ousted Rep. Nick Rahall in 2014, was their primary target. Some Democratic strategists thought Jenkins’ strength in southern West Virginia would make him the most formidable opponent against Manchin in the fall. Duty and Country spent $1.8 million on ads attacking him.\xa0\n\nMost of Duty and Country’s donors were from either New York or Massachusetts. The Greater New York Hospital Association Management Corp. donated $500,000 to the effort, and New York-based hedge fund manager James Simons donated an additional $400,000. Both have also donated to Senate Majority PAC, Schumer’s flagship super PAC.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'New Trump Rule Would Cut Federal Funds From Clinics Providing Abortions',
  'body': '\nThe Trump administration plans Friday to announce a new rule that would cut federal funds from any health clinics that provide abortions or referrals to other abortion providers, The New York Times reported. The change would mean that funds would be lost for essential health screenings for women.\nThe rule, which CBS News reported would ban federally funded clinics from discussing abortion with women,\xa0would be a massive blow to health care providers like Planned Parenthood, which offer abortions and receive some federal funds for non-abortion health services.\nLaws already prevent federal funds from being used for abortions.\xa0But clinics like Planned Parenthood use federal money for things like breast cancer screenings and other health tests. The new rules would force Planned Parenthood to either give up those funds — or stop providing abortions on the premises.\xa0\nThe Title X program connects 4 million people with birth control, STI testing, and breast and cervical exams. Trump’s @HHSGov is pushing “sexual risk avoidance,” abstinence, and marriage — instead of helping them get health care. See you in court. #IStandWithPP pic.twitter.com/LYF0jq9oV4— Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) May 2, 2018\n\n\nThe new rule reportedly would also ban any family planning clinics receiving federal funds from sharing space or facilities with abortion providers.\nClinics could continue to provide abortions only if they did so as a separate entity at a\xa0different location and with an entirely different staff,\xa0Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous administration source.\nDetails were unclear on how the rule would affect discussions with patients. A ban on discussing abortion or providing information on where to get one,\xa0blasted as a gag rule by abortion rights supporters and medical groups, would violate the doctor-patient relationship and is likely to trigger lawsuits, CBS News said.\xa0NBC reported\xa0that the Trump rule would stop short of banning clinic staff from discussing abortion with pregnant women.\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion organization the Susan B. Anthony List,\xa0thanked Trump and hailed his “decisive leadership.”\xa0\nDawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the change “outrageous,” saying it’s “designed to make it impossible for millions of patients to get birth control or preventive care from reproductive health care providers.”\nThe proposed change — to be delivered from the Health and Human Services Department to the Office of Management and Budget Friday — will drop a requirement that Title X grant recipients provide abortion counseling to patients.\xa0\nSome $290 million of Title X money was spent last year on family planning services in the nation.\xa0Medicaid money, which is the bulk of the federal funds Planned Parenthood receives, would not be affected by the new proposal, according to Bloomberg.\nThe crackdown is expected to take the harshest toll on low-income families.\xa0About two-thirds of people who visit family planning clinics are below the federal poverty level,\xa0reports NBC.\nThe Trump rule revives a Reagan-era policy that was held up in court and finally\xa0 rescinded in 1994.\nTrump, heavily backed by evangelicals, has already reinstated a ban on taxpayer funding for foreign aid organizations that provide abortions.\nLast week,\xa0Iowa passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, banning abortions as soon as a heartbeat can be detected, just weeks into a pregnancy before many women would even realize they might be pregnant.\xa0Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have already sued to stop the law as unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Denise Rohan, the head of the group, said in a statement that she welcomed the news that Trump had settled upon a nominee, but she didn’t weigh in directly on Wilkie.\xa0\nIn his previous job at the Pentagon as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Wilkie played a key role in the administration’s ban on transgender service members. He recommended to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that transgender people be allowed to serve only if they do so “in their biological sex.” Mattis later made similar recommendations to Trump.\xa0\nMatt Thorn, the spokesman for OutServe-SLDN, said the network of LGBTQ military personnel will be pressing senators to ask Wilkie about his views on LGBTQ issues.\xa0\n“Unfortunately, the VA still bars surgery for transgender veterans, which is unacceptable and must be corrected,” Thorn said.\xa0“I hope that we can ascertain more information from Mr. Wilkie during his confirmation hearing. We must have a secretary that is inclusive of all veterans and values the commitment this country has made to ensuring they receive proper and speedy care.”\nTrump had previously nominated White House doctor Ronny Jackson for the role, but Jackson withdrew from consideration last month after questions arose about his conduct in the medical office.\xa0Former colleagues accused him of overprescribing medications and being “abusive” toward employees.\xa0\nTrump personally liked Jackson, and he had picked him to be secretary without fully vetting him. Even before allegations about the doctor’s personal behavior popped up, senators and veterans groups questioned Jackson’s nomination because he has no experience managing a bureaucracy as big and complicated as the VA.\xa0\nThere is currently a lawsuit challenging Wilkie’s role\xa0as acting secretary. VoteVets, a progressive veterans advocacy group, and Democracy Forward Foundation, a nonprofit legal organization,\xa0argue that Trump illegally bypassed the order of succession when he chose Wilkie, who came over from the Defense Department.\xa0\nThey contend that Thomas Bowman, who was Shulkin’s deputy, should have been named the acting secretary.\n“Robert Wilkie never had hearings to examine his views of veterans’ care or how he envisions the VA working,” said Will Fischer, director of government relations for VoteVets. “This flies in the face of the entire system of checks and balances that federal statutes and our Constitution call for.”\nVoteVets also argues that, legally, Wilkie can no longer serve as acting secretary once he is nominated to fill the role permanently.\xa0\nThe heads of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) and ranking member Jon Tester (D-Mont.), both said they had a strong working relationship with Wilkie and looked forward to hearing more from him on his plans. Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, praised the pick and said he believed Wilkie would be an “effective” secretary.\nThe story has been updated with additional reactions to the news.\xa0\nCORRECTION:\xa0A previous version of this story indicated Rep.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House intelligence committee, and committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to review information about an FBI informant who reportedly attempted to\xa0make contact with Donald Trump’s campaign advisers\xa0prior to the 2016 election. The FBI had received evidence that the advisers had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.\nLast week President Trump accused the FBI\xa0of “spying” on his campaign for “political purposes” and demanded the Justice Department probe that investigation and alleged surveillance. On Wednesday,\xa0he dubbed the FBI probe “SPYGATE,” tweeting that it “could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!” These allegations are only the latest attempts from the president and his allies to discredit what is now special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.\nIn a Wednesday letter,\xa0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) blasted the planned meeting between Justice Department officials and GOP lawmakers as “completely improper” and warned that it “would set a damaging precedent for your institutions and the rule of law.”\xa0\nIn the letter addressed to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, the Democratic leaders argued that the meeting could create an opportunity for Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill to “prematurely access investigatory information and selectively leak national security secrets” in order to distort the facts about the Russia investigation, which has already yielded nearly two dozen indictments.\n“However,” they wrote, “if you have determined in your best judgment that Justice Department participation in the meeting is the only way to prevent this situation from devolving into an outright constitutional crisis, then we believe you must insist on the only appropriate mechanism for highly sensitive briefings that might implicate intelligence sources and methods ― a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers.”\xa0\nThe “Gang of Eight”\xa0consists of Schumer; Pelosi; Nunes; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.); House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.); Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate intelligence committee; Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee; and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.),\xa0ranking member of the House intelligence committee.\nSchiff on Wednesday called the Democrats’ exclusion from the classified briefing “a serious abuse of power.” Warner told a CNN reporter that he hoped the Justice Department “would not in any way be forced to reveal confidential information that would go against 75 years of practice.”\nSeveral Republicans are also requesting to be included\xa0in the Justice Department meeting, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa),\xa0chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic who is not seeking re-election this year,\xa0tweeted that excluding Democrats from the classified briefing “is not right.”\xa0\nThis is not right.

 {'title': 'Jeff Sessions Uses Exceptional Power Over Immigration Courts To Limit Judges’ Authority',
  'body': '\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions used his office’s vast power over immigration courts on Thursday to curb immigration judges’ authority to administratively close cases. The order could dramatically increase the already record-high backlog that immigration courts are experiencing and encourage judges to issue swift removal orders for immigrants, even if they have a case to stay in the United States.\nSessions forced the policy change by using the attorney general’s exceptional authority to overrule decisions of immigration judges ― an authority restricted to that type of court. The case Sessions announced on Thursday is one of three he referred to himself, and the first to be decided. All three cases could have far-reaching consequences for the immigration system, raising fears among immigrant rights advocates that Sessions will use the approach to further the Trump administration’s efforts to maximize deportations.\nThursday’s case concerns an immigrant, referred to as Castro-Tum, who entered the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and whose case was closed by a judge after he failed to appear at multiple court hearings.\nUsing the case to make a broad opinion not just on this decision, but those of immigration judges overall, Sessions argued that immigration judges were overstepping their authority by granting administrative closure, which doesn’t give an individual relief from deportation but pauses their case. Judges often use these closures when an immigrant has another application for relief pending; for example, if someone is in removal proceedings but waiting to be approved for a visa from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or if someone is appealing a criminal conviction that, if overturned, could affect their immigration case.\nNow, judges will be limited in their ability to close cases as those other processes move forward ― and sometimes drag on. This could lead them to order removals for immigrants who are still waiting for visa approval or other relief, attorneys warned.\n“It’s the epitome of bad docketing practice to take a whole group of cases, thousands of cases, that could be resolved by another agency and have them just sit and linger in court,” said Jeremy McKinney, national secretary for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Or worse than that, to deport people who are trying to go through the immigration system the right way.”\nSessions has given plenty of indications he disapproves of these types of case closures, and especially the frequency with which they were used under former President Barack Obama. From October 2011 through September 2017, judges closed more than 215,00 cases, which was about three-quarters of the number closed in a 31-year span before 2011, according to the Department of Justice.\nThe attorney general proclaimed in December that under Trump, DOJ was “completing, not closing, immigration cases,” and earlier this year, the agency began to set quotas for how many cases judges must clear each year.\nSessions has also called for restrictions that would allow more removals of immigrants who came to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors, as Castro-Tum did.\xa0\n\nAs the attorney general, as the head of the Department of Justice, as the person who is certifying immigration cases to himself, he needs to be neutral, impartial and he needs to adjudicate without a political agenda.\nTrina Realmuto, American Immigration Council\n\nBased on the attorney general’s statements, the American Immigration Council and other groups have\xa0filed a brief arguing Sessions was unfit to be a neutral arbiter of the case.\n“We know he is part of Trump’s political agenda to rush cases through the system,” Trina Realmuto, directing attorney of the Boston office of the American Immigration Council, said on Thursday. “But as the attorney general, as the head of the Department of Justice, as the person who is certifying immigration cases to himself, he needs to be neutral, impartial and he needs to adjudicate without a political agenda.”\nSessions did not heed their call to recuse himself, and his eventual opinion was exactly what immigrant rights advocates feared: a decision that limits the discretion of judges to determine how to operate their own dockets, potentially at the expense of immigrants.\nNow, judges will only be able to administratively close cases if there is a specific regulation or settlement that authorizes them to do so. To avoid overwhelming the courts, Sessions ordered that cases would not be put back on the calendar until the Department of Homeland Security or the immigrant respondent in each case request to do so.\nSessions wrote that judges can issue continuances postponing court proceedings rather than closing cases if they’re waiting on other pending matters. But he is weighing a separate case that could limit judges’ ability to issue such continuances.\nSessions’ moves to limit judges’ abilities to pause cases could lead to a spike in removal orders for people with legitimate claims for relief, said McKinney from the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Not that attorneys wouldn’t fight it ― McKinney said lawyers would almost certainly appeal if a client waiting on a visa approval was ordered removed, or seek relief that the judge has authority to grant, such as asylum.\nBut Sessions may be moving to make that tougher, too ― asylum is the topic of the third case he referred to himself for a potential far-reaching decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'DHS Head Says She’s Still, Somehow, Unaware Of Intel On Russia Interference To Boost Trump',
  'body': '\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Tuesday she was unaware of any intelligence assessment concluding that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to aid President Donald Trump’s campaign, even though the intelligence community concluded just that over a year ago.\nReporters asked Nielsen if she questioned a 2017 intelligence community assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed efforts to meddle in the presidential election to try and help President Trump. Nielsen said she was unaware of that assessment, which has been public for over a year.\n“I don’t believe that I have seen that conclusion,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju. “That the specific intent was to help President Trump win ― I’m not aware of that, but I do generally have no reason to doubt any intelligence assessment.”\nNielsen’s comments come as top intelligence officials\xa0say Russia is likely to meddle again and the Department of Homeland Security is working with states to improve election security ahead of the 2018 midterms. Nielsen was on Capitol Hill Tuesday with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, to brief members of Congress on election security.\nNielsen added that Russia had attempted to target “public confidence on both sides” in 2016 and would continue to do so in the future.\n“We’ve seen them encourage people to go to a protest on one side. We’ve seen them simultaneously encourage to people to go the same protest on the other side. I think what they are trying to do is to disrupt our belief and our own understanding of what’s happening,” she said. “It’s an integrity issue of who is saying what and why and how that may or may not affect American behavior.”\nIn the 2017 assessment, the FBI, CIA and NSA all agreed that Russia interfered with a preference for Trump.\n\xa0“We assess with high confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the report said. \n\xa0“We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment,” it added. \nLast week, the Senate intelligence committee, which has been investigating Russian interference in the election for over a year, affirmed the 2017 assessment from the intelligence community. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) the ranking member of the committee, on Tuesday\xa0urged Nielsen to read the 2017 report.\nTrump has not sent a clear message on election interference. He has both said that Russia interfered\xa0but also that he believed Putin’s denial.\nRep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member on the House Homeland Security committee, said in a statement he was “shocked” Nielsen seemed unfamiliar with the report.\n“The fact that she did not seem aware of the report’s findings while briefing members of Congress on the very important topic of election security is appalling to all who have tried to make progress on this issue since 2016 with little help from Republicans or this Administration,” he said in a statement. ”I sincerely hope the Secretary’s comments today were not just rhetorical gymnastics to placate the President.”\nTyler Houlton, a DHS spokesman, said shortly after that Nielsen was familiar with the 2017 assessment. Houlton added that she was not undermining it.\n“The Secretary has previously reviewed the intelligence community’s assessment and agrees with it – as she stated today and previously,” he said in a statement. “Russian goals included undermining faith in the U.S. democratic process and harming a candidate’s electability and potential presidency. \xa0Importantly, they targeted both major political parties.”\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to answer questions about whether he agreed with the 2017 intelligence community assessment.\n“I don’t have any observations to make about it,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill.\nMcConnell also refused to weigh in on whether he thought it was appropriate for Trump to intervene in a Department of Justice investigation ― especially one concerning him and his 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe president last week directed the DOJ to investigate claims that the FBI surveilled his campaign prior to the election. The Justice Department, in turn, responded by asking its inspector general to look into Trump’s charge as part of an existing probe.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, called Trump’s “demand” for a Justice Department investigation “a blatant abuse of executive power.”\n“The president’s behavior is the kind of grossly autocratic behavior we’d expect in a banana republic, not a mature democracy,” Schumer added.\n\xa0\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nTop State Election Official Pushed DHS Secretary To Explain Why Trump Contradicts Intelligence Officials On Russia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Top Democrats Want Answers On Global Health Security Head’s Sudden Departure',
  'body': '\nSens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) have requested answers from the White House about last week’s\xa0sudden departure of Rear Adm. Tim Ziemer, who led the now-disbanded global health security team at the National Security Council.\nIn a Friday letter to national security adviser John Bolton, the senators asked not only why Ziemer left, but also why his unit had been disbanded just as an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo was declared. The outbreak is now threatening the city of Mbandaka, which is home to over 1.2 million people.\nCiting HuffPost’s reporting, the senators expressed grave concerns over the reshuffling. “The threat of a pandemic is serious,” they wrote, “and it’s important families know we have a vigilant and experienced team in place and working to protect us against such public health threats.”\nZiemer, who was described in a New York Times article as “one of the most quietly effective leaders in public health,” was not the first official who pushed global health issues to leave the White House recently.\xa0Homeland security adviser Tim Bossert, another advocate for investment in global health security,\xa0left the day after Bolton began as national security adviser in April.\n\nNSC spokesman Robert Palladino told HuffPost last week that the reorganization was meant to streamline the NSC and that Ziemer left “on the warmest of terms.”\xa0\xa0\nReps.

 {'title': 'Ireland’s Historic Vote On Legalizing Abortion Is Haunted By Trump And Brexit',
  'body': '\nDUBLIN — Three weeks before Ireland’s historic vote on whether to legalize abortion, which happens Friday, I sat in a noisy pub here with Gavin Sheridan, an Irish data journalist and transparency campaigner who has closely followed the referendum. Sheridan fancies himself something of an election-whisperer, having predicted Donald Trump’s 2016 victory after a road trip through West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and he spoke with an ominous urgency about the coming vote.\nThe conventional wisdom may have it wrong, he worried. The polls suggest the referendum will be an easy walk for abortion rights supporters. A recent survey showed 56 percent of voters said they’ll vote “yes” to repeal the 8th Amendment ― a near total ban on abortion, except to save the life of the mother ― while roughly a quarter (27 percent) said they’ll vote to keep the ban in place. \xa0\nBut Sheridan wasn’t convinced. The “no” side, he explained, was running a much stronger and better-funded digital operation. Money was pouring into its coffers from God knows where. Irish voters were being bombarded with anti-abortion ads on Facebook and Youtube, some of which were carefully targeted at undecided voters. If you knew where to look, you could discern the fingerprints on the “no” side of American anti-abortion groups and some of the same firms who contributed to the surprise outcomes in the Trump election and Brexit. \nHe walked me through one example. An anonymous Facebook page and website called “Undecided on the 8th” purported to offer voters neutral information on the referendum. But its purpose was to entice undecideds to identify themselves so that anti-repeal groups could target them before the vote. Sheridan traced the origins of that page and was able to link it to at least two U.S. Catholic groups ― The Community of St. John and New York Franciscan Friars of the Atonement. \nFacebook and Google tried to crack down on foreign influence in the Irish referendum last week, banning all ads on the issue from outside Ireland to “help ensure a free, fair and transparent vote.” But those decisions haven’t stopped U.S. groups from helping out behind the scenes. Storyful, a Dublin-based social media intelligence agency where Sheridan used to work, reports that only 37 percent of digital ads for the anti-abortion rights campaign are being managed solely from inside Ireland, compared with 81 percent of ads on the abortion rights side. \nSheridan was nervous, and so were the leaders of the pro-repeal campaign.\n“I’m a very optimistic person, and I always think we’ll win this if we do the work,” said Colm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, in an interview before Facebook and Google handed down their bans. “But there’s a lot of concern about the impact of a very, very, very well-resourced and targeted digital campaign being launched by the other side, and we’re really anxious about it. There has been a big concern here, understandably ― given what we saw in the last U.S. general election and in the Brexit campaign ― about influence, and how influence might be exacted online in quite disingenuous ways.”\xa0\n\nThe indication is that there are huge amounts of money now being spent by the ‘no’ side online, both by the official campaign but more significantly by people outside the country.\nColm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland\n\nThe pro-repeal campaign in Ireland has had to raise money largely from inside the country, especially after the country’s electoral regulator earlier this year forced the “yes” effort to return a $23,450 donation from U.S. billionaire George Soros’ group, Open Societies Foundation. Ireland has a law against foreign spending on local political causes. But so far, the Standards in Public Office Commission has yet to ask the anti-abortion side to return any foreign donations or to stop the flow of help from foreign groups.\n“The indication is that there are huge amounts of money now being spent by the ‘no’ side online, both by the official campaign but more significantly by people outside the country,” O’Gorman said. “They’ve done a huge amount of work over the years raising money in the U.S. We’re looking at what we can do, and how we can scale up what we’re doing online, but we would never have that kind of money. It’s just not going to happen, because we are generally much more transparent, accountable and open about our funding. We don’t fundraise unethically, and that does put us at a disadvantage.” \nThe “Save the 8th” campaign leading the anti-repeal effort in Ireland did not respond to a request for comment. \nSteven Aden, general counsel for Americans United for Life, said U.S. activists are meddling in Ireland’s vote because the country is considered the crown jewel of the global anti-abortion movement.\n“We don’t want to see Ireland go down the road of elective abortion like the United States has,” Aden told me. “Ireland is at the top of a very slippery slope, and we’re at the bottom, unfortunately. We’re concerned this would accelerate a trend of imposing abortion-on-demand on unwilling nations in the name of women’s health.” \nWhen I asked him how exactly AUL is involved in Ireland’s referendum and how much money it’s spending, Aden hesitated to answer. “There’s not a lot I can tell you,” he said. “Most of it goes on behind the scenes. But we’re certainly encouraging our friends in the Irish Republic to vote wisely.”\nOffline, even three weeks before the vote, the referendum had a physical presence in Dublin. It was impossible to walk 20 feet here with encountering both a “Vote Yes” and a “Vote No” poster on every street corner, often stacked one on top of the other.\n\n\n\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n\n\nOn a gray and misty afternoon earlier this month, a handful of students from Trinity College wearing “Tá” pins — the Irish word for “yes” — stood on the sidewalk of the city’s main thoroughfare asking passersby if they were registered to vote. \nDrivers would occasionally beep their horns and flash a supportive thumbs-up. An elderly man waited for a break in traffic and crossed the street to approach the volunteers. “I know you’re presuming I’m going to vote ‘no,’” he confided in a low voice. “But I have daughters, granddaughters. I’m voting yes.” \nThe referendum campaign was unfolding on an intimate personal terrain. The amendment banning abortion almost entirely passed in 1983 by a 34-percentage-point margin. Thirty-five years and 10 governments later, Irish women are still forced to travel to the United Kingdom for abortions or illegally obtain abortion pills online. \nWhile the campaign to repeal the amendment has been ongoing since its passage, these latest efforts were born in the aftermath of Savita Halappanavar’s 2012 death, from a septic miscarriage; doctors had denied her an abortion, figuring that her life was not in danger. \nOne of the Trinity students I met on the sidewalk, Kevin Keane, 23, noted a recent report that three Irish women a day order abortion pills illegally to induce the procedure on their own.\n“That’s the big thing for me, that three women today are having abortions in their bedrooms and bathrooms, and no one knows this is happening,” he said. “They’ll go to work tomorrow in excruciating pain, mental anguish, and we’re just pretending it’s not happening.” \nTwo of his best friends had traveled to Liverpool to get abortions, Keane said.\n“It just seems a bit absurd to me that we essentially have abortion in Ireland already,” added Aisling Grace, 20. “The 8th Amendment is a continuation of this Irish culture of burying our heads in the sand and ignoring social issues.”\xa0\n\nSometimes a private matter needs public support.\nOne of the posters supporting the referendum to legalize abortion.\n\nNot everyone was so eager to speak about the issue. It was difficult to find a “no” voter or even an undecided one willing to speak to me about the referendum. One 65-year-old, who asked that I leave out his name, told me he is still emotionally conflicted about which way to vote. \n“There are so few things that make Ireland unique anymore,” he said. “We don’t allow abortions, and our policemen don’t carry guns. If you start changing those things, what incentive would people have to come visit our country?” \nIreland’s alleged uniqueness may be on the ballot, but the dynamics of the campaign itself were anything but novel. In addition to foreign influence and a sophisticated digital targeting effort, Sheridan saw other parallels to the U.S. presidential election. The abortion rights side seemed to be struggling with messaging, in the same way that Hillary Clinton’s “Stronger Together” failed to resonate with voters in the same way as Trump’s “Make America Great Again.”\nThe pro-repeal campaign had struggled to come up with a slogan that’s as simple and effective as the inflammatory messages being used by the other side. Framing abortion as murder in a deeply Catholic country is an easy way to tell the story.\n“If killing an unborn baby at six months bothers you,” read one poster I saw, “vote no.” \n“Six months is horrific,” read another. \nThe “yes” posters are far less direct. \n“Vote yes for compassion in a crisis,” said one. “Sometimes a private matter needs public support,” said another. \nProgressives had little problem legalizing same sex marriage in Ireland’s 2015 referendum using the message “love is love.” Explaining why people should be compassionate toward women who don’t want to continue their pregnancies and should value a woman’s life over a developing life, O’Gorman said, “is a more complicated story to tell. And in a referendum, it’s the more simple stories that can pull through.” \nThe anxiety on the left may simply be a hangover from 2016. But having lived through Brexit, no one is taking a win for granted. \n“There is undoubtedly overwhelming public support for a legal and medical framework for abortion that would require the repeal of the 8th Amendment,” said O’Gorman. “Whether or not the ‘no’ side will between now and then manage to confuse and frighten and disrupt people’s commitment to understanding that remains to be seen.” \n\n\n\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n\n\nCORRECTION:\xa0A previous version of this story misstated Colm O’Gorman’s last name as O’Gordon.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump urged attendees at a Tuesday night gala for a top anti-abortion organization to vote in November, issuing a stern warning about what might happen if they don’t.\n“If Democrats gained power, they will try to reverse these incredible gains, these are historic gains,” Trump told the audience at Susan B. Anthony List’s annual Campaign for Life event, referring to the strides made by his administration to defund abortion providers like Planned Parenthood and generally limit abortion services in the U.S.\xa0\n“Every day between now and November we must work together to elect more lawmakers who share our values, cherish our heritage, and proudly stand for life,” Trump said.\nStanding ovation as @POTUS Donald Trump announces the new #ProtectLife rule to prohibit Title X funding going to any org that performs or promotes abortion at #SBAgala pic.twitter.com/KpJk4NsxLm— Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) May 23, 2018\n\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Trump administration formally unveiled a proposal to restrict federal funding to family planning programs that provide or refer patients for abortions.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe president extolled the new rule.\n“For decades, American taxpayers have been wrongfully forced to subsidize the abortion industry through Title X federal funding, so today we have kept another promise,” Trump said to a cheering crowd. “My administration has proposed a new rule to prohibit Title X funding from going to any clinic that performs abortions.”\xa0\nUnder the new policy,\xa0there must be a “physical and financial separation” between groups that receive funds disbursed under Title X ― the only federal program dedicated solely to funding family planning and reproductive health services ―\xa0and “programs in which abortion is presented or provided as a method of family planning.”\xa0\nThe rule would prevent organizations like Planned Parenthood from getting Title X funding to cover non-abortion services like birth control or cancer screenings. As The New York Times notes, it would also prevent doctors from advising women about where they could go to receive an abortion.\nPlanned Parenthood lambasted the new policy as a “nationwide gag rule.”\xa0\n“This is one of the largest-scale and most dangerous attacks we’ve seen on women’s rights and reproductive health care in this country. This policy is straight out of the Handmaid’s Tale — yet, it’s taking effect in America in 2018,” Dawn Leguens, the group’s executive vice president, said in a statement referencing the dystopian Margaret Atwood novel and Hulu series in which women are forced into reproductive servitude.\nJUST IN: @realDonaldTrump just imposed a gag rule to cut funds to any health care provider that refers their patients for abortions.The effect: 1) violates medical ethics2) prevents women from getting full, accurate health care 2) takes care away from millions#NoGagRule pic.twitter.com/Zr2vdJT1oR— Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) May 22, 2018\n\n\nSince taking office, Trump ― together with Vice President Mike Pence ― has stridently pushed an anti-abortion agenda.\xa0\nOn his first full day as president, Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, often referred to as the “global gag rule,” which blocks foreign non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortion from accessing U.S. federal funds. In April 2017, his administration\xa0repealed an Obama-era law\xa0that barred states from defunding organizations that provide abortions.\nTrump has not always opposed abortion rights. In 1999, he told NBC News that he was “very pro-choice.” On the campaign trail, however,\xa0Trump said his stance on the issue had “evolved.”\xa0\nAs NPR noted, his flip-flop initially was a red flag for anti-abortion groups like Susan B.

 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani: Trump Won’t Interview With Mueller Until We Get ‘Spygate’ Report',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― After weeks of describing June’s planned meeting with North Korea as all-consuming, President Donald Trump’s lawyer said the canceled summit does not mean Trump will soon be speaking with prosecutors investigating his campaign.\n“No,” Rudy Giuliani said with a laugh. “It means he can talk to me.”\nHe said the cancellation of the Singapore meeting that had been set for June 12 gives him more time to work with Trump to decide next steps.\n“We could probably decide by June 12 whether to testify,” Giuliani told HuffPost on Thursday.\nThat decision, though, will apparently hinge on whether Trump is given whatever report is produced following a Justice Department probe of the FBI’s use of an informant to learn about his campaign’s contacts with Russia. Trump demanded the review on Sunday following a coordinated effort by his Capitol Hill allies and conservative media to discredit the informant.\n“Are we going to get a report on ‘spygate’?” Giuliani said, using the term Trump invented this week.\nGiuliani allowed that, as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, he never would have turned over all of his investigatory material to a potential target in that manner.\n“But I wasn’t investigating the president,” he said, justifying the demand for the FBI informant details. “You cannot compel criminal process on the president.”\n\nIt’s one of the reasons I’ve become so aggressive, so his tweeting would be confined to the subject that we’ve chosen for the day.\nRudy Giuliani on President Donald Trump\n\nGiuliani said he still would prefer for Trump to avoid Mueller completely.\n“I would not like to talk to Mueller at all,” he said. “I don’t see what you gain from that.”\nBut, Giuliani added, Trump himself has the opposite opinion. “He has a strong view that he should testify,” Giuliani said. “He believes he’s telling the truth: He didn’t collude with the Russians and he didn’t obstruct justice.”\nGiuliani conceded that Trump’s habit of saying false things on a near-daily basis could create a problem for him. But, he added, that could be avoided if Trump had enough time to prepare for a session with Mueller.\n“If we sat him down for an interview, we would be careful that it would be a solid explanation,” Giuliani said.\nHe added that he has not asked Trump to stop issuing tweets about the investigation ― based on his unsuccessful attempts to persuade Trump to stop tweeting during the 2016 campaign. “No use,” he said. “Didn’t work.”\nBut Giuliani has come up with a strategy he thinks might be working: taking a higher profile with inflammatory public comments of his own.\n“It’s one of the reasons I’ve become so aggressive, so his tweeting would be confined to the subject that we’ve chosen for the day,” he said.\nGiuliani said the cancellation of the trip to Singapore next month opens up more time for him and Trump to plan strategy, in addition to the daily or twice-a-day phone calls they have been sharing. He said he met Trump for half an hour Wednesday evening in New York City, where Trump had traveled for a fundraiser. “That half hour was devoted to the investigation,” Giuliani said.\nThe U.S. intelligence community concluded during the 2016 campaign that Russia was interfering in the U.S. election,\xa0and was actively trying to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe FBI began its probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians well before Election Day. Control of the investigation was shifted to special counsel Robert Mueller after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Soon after,\xa0the president told NBC News, as well as senior Russian officials visiting the Oval Office, that he had done so because of the investigation.\n“The fact that he did it because of the Russian investigation is not obstruction of justice,” Giuliani said. “If he did it for that reason, that would be a legitimate reason to fire [Comey]. He works at the will of the president.”\nMueller’s investigation has so far resulted in the guilty pleas of five individuals, including three former Trump campaign staffers, and the indictment of 14 other people and three companies. That total includes 13 Russians, Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and the Internet Research Agency “troll farm” that was used to create and disseminate propaganda to help Trump win.\nA related investigation by Giuliani’s former office is examining the dealings of longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. A former business partner has agreed to cooperate in that probe and plead to New York State charges.\nGiuliani, though, said Mueller’s investigation thus far has been tangential to Trump, and asserted that none of those who have pleaded guilty or are under indictment have any information that can hurt Trump.\n“They haven’t gotten anyone to flip on this,” Giuliani said, using courthouse slang for those accused of crimes to testify against associates in return for leniency. “They’re not going to do it on the bullshit that they have. Manafort’s not flipping. Cohen’s not flipping. And he has nothing to flip about.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Sen. Dean Heller’s Campaign Paid His Social Media Influencer Son More Than $50,000',
  'body': '\nNevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller’s campaign has paid his son, a social media influencer, more than $50,000 since July 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records.\nThe payments to Harris Heller and his company, Heller Enterprises, were mostly for social media consulting, but they also include small reimbursements for travel and lodging. The Heller campaign said Harris Heller’s work for the campaign includes running their Instagram page – which has 1,337 followers – and making videos for Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.\nThe Nevada senator is considered the most vulnerable Republican running for re-election in 2018. A first-term Republican running in a state narrowly won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he is expected to face Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in November.\nPaying family members with campaign funds is legal, as long as they aren’t paid more than market rate for the work and the work is for bona fide campaign services. But ethics experts have flagged the practice as problematic. It’s ensnared members of Congress from both parties, including GOP Reps. Kevin Cramer\xa0(N.D.) and Stephen King\xa0(Iowa) and Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush\xa0(Ill.).\n“A candidate or office-holder contracting with a family member raises questions about personal use of campaign money,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. “If a candidate can use donor money to fund the lifestyle of themselves or their family members, the risk of corruption goes up.”\xa0\nHarris Heller isn’t a social media neophyte.\xa0He describes himself as “Musician/social media influencer” on his LinkedIn page, declaring: “If I’m not playing guitar, snapchatting or streaming on Twitch you should probably call the police.” He and his wife, the singer Kenzie Nimmo, have hundreds of thousands of followers on their YouTube accounts and were popular on Vine before Twitter shut down the latter service. They’ve appeared on The View\xa0and in ads for Gap, Coca-Cola and HP.\xa0\xa0\n\nThe Heller campaign defended the hire, saying the younger Heller produced most of the video content for the campaign’s social media accounts, shooting hundreds of hours of video. He has also started the campaign’s Instagram account and provides story-telling expertise that traditional campaign digital consultants lack.\n“Harris Heller produces quality content at a cheap discount to the campaign.\xa0He creates social and digital media for Fortune 500 companies,” spokesman Keith Schipper said. “He is an important part of our team, and we are lucky to have him.”\nThe spokesperson said Harris Heller has produced 28 videos, including spots pushing the campaign’s tax reform message and showing his father’s extensive travels around the state.\xa0\n\nThe younger Heller has a YouTube page that went inactive in June 2017. Most of the videos on the page have between 1,000 and 3,000 views, although some have substantially more. One video, titled “I’m Doing a Nude Scene in Grey’s Anatomy,” has 16,000 views. Other popular videos include “Recording in Justin Bieber’s Studio” and “TOP 8 HIDDEN TRICKS IN POKEMON GO.”\n\nThe payments to Harris Heller began in July 2016 and have continued into 2018. On its most recent FEC report, the campaign said Harris Heller earned two payments totaling $10,000 in February and a $2,500 payment in March. (The campaign said Harris Heller is paid $2,500 a month, although those payments are sometimes delayed.)\xa0\nIn the past, campaign finance reform advocates and ethics groups have\xa0called\xa0the practice “legally alright but morally kind of sticky.”\xa0Before his retirement, former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) introduced legislation seeking to ban the practice. It attracted no co-sponsors, and never saw the Senate floor.\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415675\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n          }\n\n          \n          \n          \n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(){\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\nfunction resize() {\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\n  if ((!ifr &amp;&amp; box.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; box.offsetHeight &gt; 10) || \n      (ifr &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetHeight &gt; 10)) {\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\n    label.style.display = \'\';\n  } else {\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\n  }\n}\nfor (i=0; i&lt;10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nOn a quest to fulfill his promise to\xa0end unnecessary arrests and racial disparity\xa0in marijuana enforcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has issued a new request to the city’s police: Stop arresting people for smoking marijuana in public.\nOver the weekend, De Blasio told the New York City Police Department to issue summonses to pot smokers who were caught lighting up in public spaces instead of arresting them, reported CNN.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nOwen Hoffmann via Getty Images\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s request for police to stop arresting people\xa0who smoke marijuana in public marks the latest milestone in what observers have described as a\xa0striking shift\xa0in the city’s marijuana enforcement policy.\n\n\n\nAbout 17,880 people were arrested in the city last year for low-level marijuana possession, including smoking in public. A startling 86 percent of those arrested were people of color.\nAs The Guardian noted, De Blasio’s no-arrest recommendation won’t have an immediate impact on NYPD policy but is expected to influence a\xa030-day review of marijuana enforcement procedures currently underway at the NYPD.\xa0Phil Walzak, the department’s deputy commissioner of public information, told CNN that the issue is “certainly part of the review.”\xa0\xa0\n“The working group is reviewing possession and public smoking of marijuana to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust, while also promoting public safety and addressing community concerns,” Walzak said.\nBig news out of NYC. @NYCMayor preparing city for legalization of marijuana. As a first step, he’s telling the NYPD to stop arresting people for public pot smoking. https://t.co/PUJBr1A5zT— Rob Bennett (@rob_bennett) May 20, 2018\n\n\nDe Blasio’s request marks the latest milestone in what observers have described as a striking shift in marijuana enforcement policy in New York City ― one sparked by a growing acknowledgment of the troubling racial gap in weed-related arrests. City-wide,\xa0black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges\xa0at eight times the rate\xa0of white people over the past three years, according to a New York Times analysis published last week. In Manhattan, the racial gap was even more striking; black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people.\nLast week, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. pledged to\xa0stop prosecuting marijuana possession or smoking cases.\n“The dual mission of the Manhattan D.A.’s Office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,” Vance said in a press release announcing the policy change. “The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.”\nA day later, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office\xa0planned to reduce prosecution of low-level marijuana cases as well.\n\nThe policy shift also appears to be spurred by an expectation of impending legalization. De Blasio,\xa0one of the few New York politicians who has\xa0voiced opposition to legalizing weed, announced that he will\xa0put together a task force to prepare the city for when marijuana is legalized. De Blasio said Monday that it’s “likely inevitable” that New York state will legalize the drug.\xa0\n\nThe legalization of marijuana in New York State is likely inevitable.

  'body': '\nJim Bridenstine, Donald Trump’s pick as NASA administrator, appeared to change his tune on climate change\xa0during his first employee town hall since he was confirmed to the position, acknowledging that human beings contribute significantly to the warming of the planet.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“As far as my position on climate change and how it’s evolved, I’ll be very open,” he told NASA employees Thursday. “I don’t deny that consensus that the climate is changing. In fact, I fully believe and know that the climate is changing. I also know that we human beings are contributing to it in a major way.”\nHumans are putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere “in volumes that we haven’t seen, and that greenhouse gas is warming the planet. That is absolutely happening, and we are responsible for it.”\xa0\nThe remarks represent a significant departure from comments he made only a few months ago during his confirmation hearing, when he stated that humans are contributing to global warming but wouldn’t quantify their role.\xa0\n“It’s going to depend on a whole lot of factors, and we’re still learning more about that every day,” he said last November. “In some years, you could say absolutely. In other years, during sun cycles and other things, there are other contributing factors that would have more of an impact.”\nBridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma, is the first elected official to become NASA administrator. He was narrowly confirmed by the Senate 50-49, and politicians on both sides of the aisle shared their concerns about Bridenstine during the months-long nomination process.\nThe primary concern was his lack of\xa0space experience, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said last September.\xa0\nCritics have also pointed to his climate-denying past.\xa0In a 2016\xa0interview\xa0with Aerospace America, he insisted that the climate has always changed, countering any human responsibility.\n“Going back to the 1600s, we have had mini ice ages from then to now.”\nIn a June 2013 speech,\xa0he also asserted that global temperatures “stopped rising 10 years ago” and asked for an apology from then-President Barack Obama, accusing him of a “gross misallocation” of funds for climate change research instead of weather forecasting.\n',

 {'title': 'Giuliani Says Mueller Can’t Talk To Trump Until Trump Hears More About FBI Source',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― One of Donald Trump’s lawyers said Monday that the president can’t agree to an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller’s team without first learning more about the secret FBI informant who spoke with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 race.\n“We can’t let our guy go in and be questioned without knowing this,” Rudy Giuliani\xa0said in an interview with HuffPost on Monday afternoon.\nGiuliani,\xa0who is on Trump’s private legal team,\xa0spoke with HuffPost after Trump met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, about congressional requests for information on the secret FBI source. The decision to set up the meeting, Giuliani said, was made by Trump and his White House lawyers without Giuliani’s involvement, although he said he supported it.\n“I didn’t advise against it,” Giuliani said. “He has a right as president to say to the Justice Department you have to comply with a congressional subpoena or request.”\nAlthough Giuliani said the meeting was held in Trump’s capacity as president rather than as a potential criminal target, he acknowledged that the FBI releasing information about the source would benefit Trump’s defense.\n“I don’t care so much about the name as I do about the content,” he said. “What prompted them to do it? What did they learn from it?”\nMonday’s unusual meeting with Rosenstein and Wray ― both Republicans appointed by the president ― was set up to discuss what Trump has described as the infiltration or surveillance of his 2016 campaign team. Before the election, a confidential FBI source reportedly met with associates of the campaign who were suspected of working with Russia. Trump allies on Capitol Hill have demanded information about the FBI source, a Cambridge University professor whose name was widely published over the weekend.\nIn a statement after the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the Justice Department had asked its inspector general to look into “any irregularities ... concerning the Trump Campaign” and agreed to a meeting with congressional leaders to “review highly classified and other information they have requested.” Although Sanders said the Justice Department had requested the inspector general probe “[b]ased on the meeting with the President,”\xa0the department had actually decided to make that request after the president tweeted about the matter on Sunday. The Justice Department declined to comment.\nTrump has sided with his defenders on Capitol Hill who have used their oversight powers to try to undermine the Mueller investigation.\nI hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 20, 2018\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Monday’s meeting will diffuse the tensions between Trump and the Justice Department. It’s unclear what documents the department agreed to turn over to Congress.\nRosenstein, a lifelong Republican whom Trump nominated to the No. 2 position in the Justice Department, has come under fire from the president’s defenders upset over the appointment of a special counsel. Trump defenders on Capitol Hill have recently been requesting more information about the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nRosenstein, speaking earlier this month in response to a question about calls for his impeachment, said the Justice Department “will not be extorted” by threats. But when the president tweeted on Sunday that he wanted an investigation into allegations that the FBI had “infiltrated or surveilled”\xa0his campaign, Rosenstein said the department would ask its own watchdog to look into it.\n“If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,” Rosenstein said in the statement.\n\n\n\n\nCarlos Barria / Reuters\n\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray (right) arrives at the West Wing of the White House for a meeting with President Donald Trump on May 21, 2018.\n\n\n\nGiuliani acknowledged on Monday that he wanted to keep the names of confidential informants a secret when he was a federal prosecutor. “I always wanted to withhold their names,” he said.\nBut in this case, he said, he cannot understand the Justice Department’s opposition to releasing the name. “First of all, the name is out there. So I don’t know what they’re fighting about,” he said.\nGiuliani agreed that critics who worried about GOP Rep. Devin Nunes’ ability to act as an honest broker had a valid point. Nunes,\xa0chairman of the House intelligence committee, has recently been fundraising off his defense of Trump.\n“Sure he’s a partisan. He’s probably outraged that the president was put in this position,” Giuliani said,\xa0but he added that Nunes’ loyalty to Trump does not give the Justice Department the right to withhold information from him.\n“You don’t get to choose who the members of Congress are.

  'body': '\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) on Sunday pushed for arming teachers and reducing the number of entrances into school buildings after the latest mass shooting at a U.S.\xa0school afflicted his state.\nPatrick, a staunch conservative, appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and ABC’s “This Week” to discuss responses after a lone gunman opened fire at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, on Friday,\xa0killing eight students and two teachers.\n“There was a teacher next door, a (former) Marine, who saw what was going on... Some feel had he been able to carry a gun, he could have stopped that shooter,” he told host Jake Tapper on the CNN program.\xa0\n“We need armed teachers,” says Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick after school shooting in Santa Fe #CNNSOTU https://t.co/kBp4F9G0AC https://t.co/QLfIuIE3rG— CNN (@CNN) May 20, 2018\n\n\nPatrick said that as he visited a hospital on Friday night where some of those wounded in the shooting had been treated, students and parents alike said that teachers should be armed.\xa0\nHe told “This Week” host Geroge Stephanopoulos that “our teachers are part of that well-run militia,” a mangled reference to the language of the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment. That amendment says that a “well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\n“It’s guns that also stop crimes,” Patrick added.\nUnder a\xa0school marshal program\xa0in Texas that has been cited approvingly by President Donald Trump, teachers can carry guns on campus,\xa0with local officials ultimately making the call on whether that is allowed.\nPatrick also said that the issue underlying the raft of school shootings plaguing the U.S. isn’t access to guns, but that “it’s about us.”\n“We have devalued life, whether it’s through abortion, whether it’s the breakup of families, through violent movies, and particularly violent video games which now outsell movies and music,” he said.\nHe also reiterated the suggestion he first made Friday immediately after the shooting that school campuses be redesigned to have fewer entrances.\xa0\n“We need to get down to one or two entrances to our schools. We have to funnel our students into our schools so we can put eyes on them,” he said.\xa0\nEven before Friday’s shooting, several Republican politicians, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen.

 {'title': 'Gina Haspel Confirmed As CIA Director With Aid Of Democrats',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― The Senate on Thursday confirmed Gina Haspel to be President Donald Trump’s CIA director after a number of Democrats facing tough reelection fights this year announced they would support her nomination.\nHaspel, a former clandestine officer with more than 30 years of service at the agency, was confirmed by a narrow 54-45 vote. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) joined nearly every Republican in voting to approve her nomination.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nHaspel’s appointment to the CIA capped a contentious debate over the George W. Bush-era enhanced interrogation program ― which included torture techniques like waterboarding. The issue became relevant again after Trump pledged during his presidential campaign to revive torture.\nHuman rights advocates and even some Republicans, like Sens. John McCain (R-Arizona) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), objected to Haspel because of her involvement in the torture program after the 9/11 attacks and her role in the subsequent destruction of videotapes that showed interrogations of certain suspects.\nMcCain’s opposition to Haspel, in particular, weighed heavily on the minds of his colleagues. The Arizona senator was tortured while in captivity during the Vietnam War and has long been an influential voice on the issue. Sen. Jeff Flake, the junior GOP senator from Arizona, also opposed Haspel because she had “not adequately answered” questions about her role in the destruction of interrogation tapes.\nBut McCain’s prolonged absence from the Senate ― he has been battling brain cancer in Sedona ― could be felt as well. It’s one thing to read a statement from McCain ― it’s entirely another thing to look into his eyes and tell him you intend to oppose him when it comes to the issue of torture.\nDemocrats had the power to block Haspel’s nomination. But a key moment heralding their defeat came when Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, announced he would back her. The Virginia Democrat, whose state is home to CIA’s headquarters, cited Haspel’s written disavowal of the interrogation program as sufficient to gain his endorsement. His announcement gave several other moderate Democrats cover to back her as well.\nIn remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Warner said he wished Haspel had been more forceful in denouncing the program during her confirmation hearing. Ultimately, however, he said that private assurances from Haspel about her views on torture and her long list of bipartisan endorsements from the intelligence community had won him over.\n“I will feel safer knowing the CIA has Ms. Haspel leading it,” Warner said Thursday. He added that he was confident that Haspel would stand up and refuse an order from Trump if he tells her “to do something illegal or immoral, like torture.”\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lamarque / Reuters\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Emails Show Interior Expected To Learn Nothing From Public Input On Bears Ears Review',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON — In May 2017, a little more than a week after President Donald Trump signed a pair of unpopular executive orders threatening the future of 27 national monuments, the Interior Department announced\xa0it was giving the American public a chance to weigh in.\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke boasted that the comment period “finally gives a voice to local communities and states,” parties the Trump administration claims past presidents ignored when granting protections to new monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906. \nAnd after the comment periods closed in July, Zinke said he appreciated “everyone who took the time to log-on or write in and participate in our government,” and that the input would help inform his decisions.\nBut internal documents show that in the case of Bears Ears National Monument, the administration conducted its review assuming it had little, if anything, to learn; that it had all the information it needed to decide the fate of the Utah site. \nRandal Bowman, a senior policy analyst at the Interior Department, led a May 31 webinar to train a dozen agency staffers on how to read and catalog public comments the agency fielded on its review of Bears Ears, a 1.35 million-acre monument the Obama administration established in late 2016. During the hour-long training, Bowman told the review team that because the Utah monument was so new and a management plan had not yet been adopted, it would be “virtually impossible” for a member of the public to submit information that hadn’t previously been considered.\n“Essentially, barring a surprise, there is no new information that’s going to be submitted,” Bowman told staffers, according to a video\xa0of the event. A link to the webinar was included in an email released as part of a public records request.\nWhen one member of the review team asked Bowman to clarify his previous comment, he said, “I can’t visualize what a new [piece of] information would be. But I’m not ruling it out.”\nFrom the start, Trump and Zinke’s public criticisms suggested Bears Ears wouldn’t survive intact, and that the administration’s review and public comment period was mostly for show. At the April signing ceremony, Trump said the Bears Ears designation “should never have happened” and that he was going to free up the land to “tremendously positive things.”\xa0Still, the Interior Department maintained its review would be fair and thorough.\n\n\n\n\nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a pen after signing the hat of Bruce Adams, chairman of the San Juan County Commission, after signing an order shrinking Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City, Utah,\xa0on Dec. 4, 2017.\n\n\n\nBowman’s comments during the training, as well as subsequent internal emails, are likely to add to critics’ speculation that the outcome — at least for Bears Ears — was predetermined; that the administration was not really interested in what the general public had to say.\nBowman and the Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a report summary\xa0made public in August, Zinke acknowledged that the vast majority of the 2.8 million public comments\xa0his department received as part of its sweeping review favored maintaining national monuments. But he chalked up that one-sidedness as being the result of “a well-orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations.”\nThe administrative review culminated with Trump traveling to Utah in December, where he announced he was slashing\xa0Bears Ears by 85 percent, opening the door for new mining, drilling and other development. Nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, the largest land national monument in the country, was cut roughly in half. The rollback was the largest reduction of national monuments in history.\nInterior Associate Deputy Secretary James Cason tapped Bowman, a senior policy analyst who’s worked at the department for more than 30 years, to lead the review process in early May, documents show.\xa0\nBowman is among several Interior Department career staffers who quickly rose within Trump’s ranks, as The Washington Post reported. The Post noted Bowman is known among some of his colleagues as “the cicada,” a supporter of limited government who “goes underground during Democratic administrations.” In 2008, Bowman was involved in a scandal\xa0in which Interior Department officials meddled in the listing of endangered species.\nTo make easy work of analyzing public comments on the monument review, the Interior Department hired software company Texifter LLC.\xa0An online summary of the\xa0$23,387 contract is dated May 23. As Bowman and Stu Shulman, president of Texifter, highlighted in the May 31 training, the platform allowed reviewers to mark comments as either supporting or opposing the review, as well as flag any that went beyond an expressed opinion and offered new information. \nBowman wrote in a May 6 exchange with Downey Magallanes, a top aide of Zinke who also played a key role in the review, that he expected the comments to be ” 99-1 against any changes.”\n“We will need to know within a few weeks how you want the substantive ones handled ― short summary, just list them by source ― name of group or individual, particularly impressive ones (if any) set aside for Secretary [Zinke] to read or not, etc.,” Bowman added.\n\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOT/DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n\n\nBecause Trump gave Zinke a much shorter deadline to make an initial recommendation on Bears Ears than other monuments impacted by the review,\xa0Bowman and his team initially focused their attention on those public comments. Of the approximately 59,000 comments specific to Bears Ears, the vast majority — 95 percent — voiced opposition to Trump making changes to the monument, according to an internal email. About 54,000 comments were submitted as form letters or petitions and were easily categorized. The remaining 5,000 or so were unique and had to be individually reviewed by Interior Department staff.\nOn June 4, a little more than a week before Zinke submitted an interim report recommending\xa0Trump shrink Bears Ears, Bowman flagged what he described as “perhaps the only substantial new information submitted on Bears Ears.”\n\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOT/DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n\n\nThat comment came from Jim Carlson, a managing partner at Stillwater Technical Solutions, a consulting firm based in Garden City, Kansas. Attached was a report that the commissioners of San Juan County — staunch opponents of the Bears Ears monument designation — paid Carlson $53,000 to produce. It was published in October 2016, roughly two months before President Barack Obama designated the protected site in southeastern Utah.\nIn the lengthy document, Carlson and his co-authors put forward a slew of arguments for why they thought Obama did not have the authority to establish the Bears Ears area as a national monument. At the time, a coalition of five Native American tribes that consider the area sacred was petitioning Obama to set aside 1.9 million acres. It is named after a pair of towering buttes and among the most archaeologically-rich sites in the nation. \n“If the [President of the United States] has authority to designate a monument of any size, shape, or area — for any reason — then what is to stop POTUS from withdrawing large swaths, regions, or even entire States under the cover of the Antiquities Act?” Carlson and others at Stillwater wrote in their conclusion.\nAlthough the report contains more information than the vast majority of comments, it was not new, as Bowman suggested. And it seems highly unlikely that no other substantive information was submitted as part of the review.\nTake this comment, submitted May 25, in which dozens of environmental and natural resources law professors provided a detailed argument for why presidents do not have the authority to abolish, shrink or otherwise weaken national monuments.\nIt’s also important to note that San Juan County officials hired Carlson to produce the document as part of their fight to prevent a monument from being established in the first place. \nCarlson told HuffPost that he met with the Obama administration ahead of its 2016 designation and believes his findings ultimately resulted in the administration opting to designate 1.35 million acres rather than 1.9 million. He added that he was not surprised to learn Interior Department officials in the Trump administration gave special attention to his report. \n“We are really a significant researcher in natural resources,” he said. “That would stand to reason that they would flag that and use our material. To our knowledge, we know of no one in the country that does our level of research.”\nIt is unclear if Carlson’s report influenced Zinke’s recommendation or Trump’s final decision on Bears Ears. Carlson said he was not contacted to discuss the findings.\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nTrump Opened Bears Ears Monument To Mining, So We Went To Stake A Claim\n\n\nWhy Trump Doesn’t Have The Power To Mess With National Monuments\n\n\nTrump’s ‘Review’ Of Utah Monument Was Over Before It Started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Trump’s New ‘Domestic Gag Rule’ Would Strip Funds From Planned Parenthood',
  'body': '\nThe Trump administration will propose a new rule Friday that would block federal funds to any organization that provides or even shares space with an abortion provider\xa0―\xa0a domestic version of the so-called “Global Gag Rule” the president reinstated and expanded last year.\xa0\nThe move would notably strip Title X funding from Planned Parenthood, which provides birth control, STI testing and treatment, and cancer screenings to more than one-third of the federal family planning program’s 4 million low-income patients. Planned Parenthood decried the move particularly in light of the news that billionaire Bill Gates said he had to explain to President Donald Trump\xa0― twice ― the difference between HIV and HPV.\xa0\n“This is a far-reaching attack and attempt to take away women’s basic rights and reproductive rights, period,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, said in a call with reporters Friday. “I would posit that a president who it’s clear does not know the difference between HIV and HPV should not be interfering in the doctor-patient relationship.”\xa0\n\nThis is a far-reaching attack and attempt to take away women’s basic rights and reproductive rights, period.\nDawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood\n\nAnti-abortion advocates have been pushing Trump since the beginning of his term to fulfill his campaign promise to defund Planned Parenthood,\xa0especially since Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried and failed to do so. A coalition of conservative groups sent the administration a letter on May 1\xa0urging them to take this step.\n“The pro-life grassroots are furious with the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to stop taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood,”\xa0said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. “We urge the Trump administration to act swiftly to revise the Title X regulations, stopping the flow of Title X dollars to abortion centers.”\nFederal law already prohibits public funds from being used to pay for abortions. Women who seek abortions at Planned Parenthood or other providers must cover the cost of the procedure themselves unless their insurance plan covers it. Trump’s proposed rule would strip funds used for birth control and STD testing from organizations like Planned Parenthood and roll back a requirement that providers who receive federal subsidies for family planning services offer women information about the full range of reproductive health options, including abortion.\nProgressives are pushing back. Earlier this week, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and 40 other senators sent\xa0a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services\xa0warning of the “devastating impact” of the proposed rule on communities of color, the uninsured, and low-income women in particular;\xa0over\xa0a hundred members of the House\xa0penned a similar letter.\n“This ‘gag rule’ would bar patients from receiving information to support their ability to make informed decisions about their own reproductive health,” the senators wrote.\xa0\nThe rule will be subject to a public comment period after it’s proposed, and reproductive rights groups are likely to challenge it in court.\nThis story has been updated to correct a statistic provided by Planned Parenthood about the percentage of patients it serves from the federal family planning program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nTwo parents who lost children to campus gun violence had strong words of criticism on Sunday for the GOP’s continued dismissal of responding with tougher firearm control measures and more emphasis on preventing shootings.\xa0\xa0\nFred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, joined Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, to speak with host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth parents voiced their disappointment with Republican politicians for ignoring the topic of gun control in the wake of the school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas,\xa0on Friday in which 10 people died.\xa0\nGuttenberg and Hockley spoke shortly after Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) appeared on the talk show and\xa0blamed the most recent school shooting on American culture, saying that “we have devalued life.”\xa0\n“I think those are the most idiotic comments I’ve ever heard regarding gun safety,” Guttenberg said in response to Patrick.\n“I’m here this weekend on what was supposed to be my daughter’s dance recital, where they are honoring my daughter’s memory instead of having my daughter dance,” he said. “For that man to be making those moronic comments? Unacceptable.”\n“I am raging right now,” Guttenberg, who\xa0confronted Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) at a heated CNN town hall after the Parkland shooting, told Stephanopoulos.\nHockley said that focusing on arming teachers and changing the layout of school campuses ― two things Patrick has advocated in response to Friday’s shooting ― avoids the root of the problem.\xa0\n″We’re simply focusing on the wrong thing here,” she said. She characterized the measures Patrick has been spotlighting as “mitigation,” not “prevention.”\xa0\n“While I disagree with much of what the lieutenant governor said, I do agree that we have a problem where we devalue life. ... That this shooting is not receiving a significant amount of action, that’s devaluing life.”\xa0\nBoth parents agreed that the pervasive issue of campus gun violence isn’t just about guns ― but they argued that firearms, and access to them, has to be a central aspect of the conversation.\xa0\n“This is not just about guns. It’s not just about school safety. It’s not just about mental health,”\xa0Guttenberg said.\nBut he added,\xa0“The problem is that when these shootings happen, the crowd that does not want to talk about guns wants to talk about everything else but guns.”\xa0\xa0\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nThese Are The Victims Of The Santa Fe High School Shooting\n\n\nParkland Survivor Offers Support To Santa Fe Students: ‘You Didn’t Deserve This’\n\n\nSanta Fe School Shooting In Survivors’ Own Words\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Congress Does Wall Street A Favor As Banks Post Record Profits',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― Congress sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk Tuesday intended to roll back regulations adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, weakening consumer protection and modestly increasing the risk of another banking collapse.\nThe bill’s passage marks the second major legislative victory for both Trump and the financial sector, following last year’s tax cut. The package will benefit banks both large and small, limit consumer remedies against credit reporting agencies including the scandal-plagued Equifax, curb the government’s ability to collect data on racial discrimination in the housing market, and allow large regional banks to rely on more risky debt to finance their operations.\nTuesday’s 258-159\xa0House vote came as banks are posting record profits thanks to a stronger economy and lower tax rates. The U.S. banking industry posted a combined $56 billion profit in the first quarter of 2018, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its best three-month stint in history. Community banks ― smaller institutions in rural parts of the country that proponents of the bill claimed were in need of particular aid ― also posted billions in net profits.\nNevertheless, banks still need deregulation, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said.\n“Big banks keep getting bigger,”\xa0Cole told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Small banks are being regulated out of existence.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Republicans in control of the House, the bill’s eventual approval was a fait accompli after 17 Senate Democrats voted for it in March. \nThe 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law included a host of consumer protections and risk management rules that apply to all banks. But it applied tougher rules to the largest banks, since the failure of a large firm can have dire consequences for the broader economy. Banks with at least $50 billion in assets have to undergo frequent stress-testing by the Federal Reserve to determine whether they could withstand an unexpected financial shock. They must finance their operations with more capital and less borrowed money, and they have to keep more cash on hand. \nThe bill approved Tuesday would change the definition of what constitutes the biggest banks, freeing banks with up to $250 billion in assets from these tougher rules. Huge regional players like BB&T and SunTrust would be exempted, as would foreign conglomerates with trillions of dollars in global assets ― like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS ―\xa0that keep less than $250 billion of their assets in the United States.\n“Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial system,” former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker wrote in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who voted against the legislation. Volcker in particular highlighted the risks posed by curtailing oversight of “several large foreign banks,” suggesting that a $100 billion threshold would be more appropriate.\nWhen the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation in March, it concluded that while the risk of another banking crash in any specific year was small, the odds “would be slightly greater under the legislation.”\nThe risk would be worth making it easier for small and intermediate-sized banks to provide credit, Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House financial services committee, said Tuesday. “Everything in life is a balancing act.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanking analysts also expect\xa0large regional banks to acquire more small community lenders as a result of the bill, since they will not be penalized with tougher regulations for growing past the $50 billion mark.\nThe subprime mortgage crisis revealed that banks had systematically steered families of color into expensive, predatory loans. Dodd-Frank sought to address this in part by requiring lenders to report a host of data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition to basic facts about loan approval or denial, lenders had to report a borrower’s age and credit score, as well as the property value of the home being purchased, the interest rate, loan terms, and other pricing features of each mortgage. The CFPB could use all of this data to determine whether families of color were being improperly overcharged or pushed into bad loans. \nThe bill approved Tuesday would exempt 85 percent of banks from those new anti-discrimination reporting requirements, in an effort to save paperwork costs. A host of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Urban League and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have all assailed the provision.\nThe bill also contains several provisions that are supposed to benefit consumers, such as by requiring credit monitoring firms to let people freeze their credit reports, which contain personal financial information that companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion collect without prior consent. Equifax proved a poor custodian of that information last year when the company announced hackers had stolen personal data relating to more than 140 million Americans.\nConsumer advocates say the supposed benefits are actually a mixed bag, because some provisions would preempt more generous state laws and others could prevent consumers from joining class-action lawsuits. \nOne provision is a straightforward giveaway to Equifax and its ilk, since it would force government-backed mortgage companies to consider using their credit-scoring algorithm as part of the home lending process. Liberal and conservative groups alike, as well as other housing finance stakeholders, oppose the provision. \nRep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), another member of the House financial services committee, dismissed concerns about restricting consumers from being able to join class-action lawsuits, noting that they can still settle disputes by arbitration.\n“You’re choosing to focus on one of the credit rating agencies,” he told HuffPost when asked how the bill would affect Equifax. “I think that goes far beyond the very narrow focus that you’re taking on it. Consumers should always have remedies for bad actors, always.”\n",

  'body': '\nFollowing another school shooting, this one leaving 10 dead and 13 injured in Texas, Houston’s police chief is calling out elected officials for their failure to protect the children they claim to hold so dear.\nPolice Chief Art Acevedo posted a pained message on Facebook after Friday’s shooting in the nearby town of Santa Fe, in which a 17-year-old student at Santa Fe High School gunned down his classmates and a teacher.\nNo one ― not even the terrified kids themselves\xa0―\xa0seemed to be all that surprised, with one student telling the local news she felt “eventually it was going to happen here too.”\n\nAcevedo said he has had enough inaction when it comes to protecting children.\n“Today I spent the day dealing with another mass shooting of children and a responding police officer who is clinging to life,”\xa0the police chief wrote Friday. “I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve shed tears of sadness, pain and anger.”\xa0\n\n\n\nHe had a message to those who would choose their guns over the safety of kids.\n“I know some have strong feelings about gun rights, but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue,” he said.\xa0\nFriday’s massacre was the 22nd school shooting of 2018. It is only May.\xa0\nThe police chief previously marched with demonstrators during the March 24 March for Our Lives event, held in response to the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a\xa0Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 dead.\n“This isn’t a time for prayers, and study and inaction, it’s a time for prayers, action and the asking of God’s forgiveness for our inaction (especially the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing),” Acevedo added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump\xa0needs at least $22 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall he wants to build, so a Tennessee lawmaker has introduced a bill that would let him crowdfund the money.\nThe\xa0Border Wall Trust Fund Act, introduced Friday by Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), would “allow the secretary of the Treasury to accept public donations to fund the construction of a barrier on the border between the United States and Mexico, and for other purposes.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the bill, the treasury secretary would establish an account for the donations and “create a publicly accessible website to receive such gifts.”\nThe bill also calls for money to be used to construct a mile-long “commemorative display” to honor donors — unless the “secretary determines that length to be impracticable.”\nWhen Black appeared on Fox News Monday to discuss the bill, host Harris Faulkner shot back: “What happened to Mexico paying for it?”— which Trump repeatedly vowed would happen, despite Mexico’s clear objections.\nBlack, who’s running for governor of Tennessee, said that while she would like to see Mexico pay for the structure, she was uncertain “what kind of pressure” the Trump administration was putting on Mexico for the funds.\nBlack said she has received a positive response to the bill. She said people can send money to the federal government for the wall now, but there’s no current guarantee the funds would be spent that way. Black explained that her bill would “dedicate a fund” for the wall.\nThe congresswoman said that she and her husband would be the first to write a check if the bill becomes law, but didn’t say how much they would donate.\nIn March,\xa0$1.6 billion in U.S. taxpayer money\xa0was earmarked for ongoing or planned border projects, but that didn’t include money for constructing Trump’s wall. Early this month, the president threatened to shut down the federal government if he didn’t get wall funding.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has estimated that the proposed border wall would cost at least $21.6 billion to build,\xa0though another estimate goes up to\xa0$70 billion.\nUSA Today created an interactive map of\xa0existing barriers\xa0along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n',

 {'title': 'The Georgia GOP Governor’s Primary Focuses On Guns And Immigration',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― The race for Georgia’s Republican gubernatorial nomination is all about the culture war. \nThe three leading\xa0candidates have aired ads showing themselves wielding rifles and handguns. One declared he owned a “big truck” just in case he needed to round up criminal illegals and “take them home myself.” Not to be topped, another started a statewide tour with a “deportation bus.” \nThe attention-grabbing ads and stunts have highlighted a seven-candidate race in which, should none get more than 50 percent of the vote in Tuesday’s primary, the top two finishers will advance to a late July runoff.\n The frontrunners are Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp. \xa0\nIn one of Kemp’s ads, he holds a shotgun while “interviewing” a young man interested in dating one of his daughters. The requirements for wooing that daughter?\n“Respect and a healthy appreciation for the 2nd Amendment,” the suitor replies.\nThe uproar generated by the ad could help Kemp stand out in a field that includes former state Sen. Hunter Hill, state Sen. Michael Williams and former Navy SEAL and businessman Clay Tippins.\nCagle also holds a gun in one of his spots, as a narrator brags about his endorsement by the National Rifle Association. The NRA’s backing came after he pushed an amendment to kill a tax break benefiting Georgia-based Delta following the company’s decision ― in reaction to February’s mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida ― to end a discount program for NRA members flying to the group’s national convention. (Never mind that the discount program was rarely used.)\n In another ad, Cagle brags about his work to end so-called sanctuary cities\xa0for undocumented immigrants in the state.\xa0\nHill, who has the endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), released an ad where he shoots a target and argues the age requirement to buy a handgun should be lowered to 18 from 21. “As governor, I won’t give an inch on our 2nd Amendment,” he says in the ad.\xa0\n\nBut those ads were just a set-up for the biggest free media play in the race: Williams’ deportation bus, which he drove around the state, promising “to fill this bus with illegals and send them back to where they came from. He would do so by implementing a program that allows state and local police to enforce immigration law under a partnership with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\nIt worked. Williams received attention from local\xa0and national\xa0media, even landing an interview with Fox News\xa0― a prize for any candidate in a competitive GOP primary. (Williams also received plenty of mockery when the bus briefly broke down.)\nThe winner of the GOP primary will face one of the two Democrats,\xa0both former state representatives, in November: Stacey Abrams or Stacey Evans.\xa0\nThe DCCC vs. Laura Moser\xa0\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n\nDemocrat Laura Moser’s campaign in Texas’ 7th Congressional District became a flashpoint in battles between progressive insurgents and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\n\nThe showdown between journalist and activist Laura Moser and lawyer Lizzie Fletcher has become much bigger than a normal race for a House district nomination.\nThe decision by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to attack Moser as unelectable\xa0turned the contest into a symbol of a broader battle between progressive candidates and the national party apparatus. That drove donations to Moser,\xa0helping to lift her over other candidates in the March primary and into a runoff against Fletcher, who has the backing of EMILY’s List.\nThe runoff campaign between the two fizzled somewhat ― The Texas Tribune labeled the contest “boring,”\xa0and the progressive energy and money animating Moser’s insurgency appears to have dried up.\xa0\nThe winner of the race will face Rep. John Culberson in a 7th Congressional District centered around west Houston. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the district by fewer than 2 percentage points in 2016. If Moser does pull off a win in the runoff, the race will become an instant test of whether progressives can win despite Democratic establishment doubts.\xa0\nThe Club For Growth Takes Texas\n\nThe Club for Growth, which views itself as the enforcer of GOP orthodoxy on free-market economics, has had an up-and-down few years. Its attacks on Donald Trump in the GOP presidential primaries were unable to stop his march to victory. Still, they ended up loving his tax cuts ― while hating his proposals to enact tariffs and restrict free trade.\xa0\nThe group sees a slew of open House seats in heavily Republican territory in Texas as a chance to reassert its influence. Club for Growth Action, the group’s political arm, has aired TV ads in four different districts in the run-up to Tuesday’s GOP runoffs. The group backs Michael Cloud (who’s also been endorsed by former Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul) in the 27th District, former Cruz chief of staff Chip Roy in the 21st, local official Ron Wright in the 6th, and GOP activist Bunni Pounds to replace Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling in the 5th.\xa0\nPounds, Cloud, Roy and Wright are all expected to join the House Freedom Caucus if elected to Congress.\xa0\nRemember Georgia’s 6th District?\n\n\n\n\nJessica McGowan via Getty Images\n\n\nRepublican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in a special election last year in the most expensive House race in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nThe special election last year to replace then-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Congress turned into the most expensive House race in the nation’s history, with over $40 million spent on TV and radio advertising alone. In the end, Republican Karen Handel triumphed over Democrat Jon Ossoff in an early test of Democratic resistance to Trump.\nThe Democratic primary to challenge Handel this year has been sleepier, to say the least.\nFormer TV news anchor Bobby Kaple has raised the most money in the field, and earned the endorsement of former Gov. Roy Barnes and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. Kevin Abel, a businessman, also amassed a significant war chest.\nBut the late entrance of Lucy McBath, a former Delta flight attendant who became a gun control activist following the shooting death of her son, could shake up the contest. McBath only entered the contest following the massacre in Parkland, but has the backing of EMILY’s List. Also supporting her is Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg-backed group where McBath previously worked. The group has spent more than $500,000 on TV ads supporting her.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

In January 2017,\xa0Jared Kushner resigned as chief executive of the family business to become an adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald Trump. He has, however,\xa0retained a significant stake in the company.\nRoughly a year, two potential deals involving 666 Fifth Avenue fell through ― with\xa0Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company, and with Qatari billionaire Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani\xa0― over concerns about Jared Kushner’s possible conflict of interest between advancing the family business and protecting U.S. interests.\nKushner, who advises the president on Middle East policy among other issues, has reportedly been under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller\xa0over his alleged efforts to boost the family company with investors in Qatar,\xa0the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Russia and China.\nOne of Brookfield’s major investors is the state-owned Qatar Investment Authority, according to the Times. But both Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority denied that the Qatari government was involved in any such transaction with Kushner Companies.\n“No Qatar-linked entity has any involvement in, investment in or even knowledge of this potential transaction. They are in no way involved,” a Brookfield spokesperson told HuffPost on Thursday.\nA press representative for the Qatar Investment Authority similarly told HuffPost that it has “no involvement whatsoever in this deal.”\nThe Kushner Companies declined to comment for this story.\nThe Kushners purchased 666 Fifth Avenue at the beginning of 2007, right before the economy crashed,\xa0for a whopping $1.8 billion. That price amounted to nearly twice as much, per square foot, as a building in Manhattan had ever sold for, according to The Daily Beast. Within a year, the Kushners were $1.4 billion in debt.\nThe 41-story building has continued to struggle financially,\xa0generating only half its annual mortgage payment and remaining roughly 30 percent vacant. If the deal goes through as reported, Brookfield would take over leasing and operations at the skyscraper and embark on major renovations.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Border Agent Fatally Shoots Migrant Woman In Texas',
  'body': "\nA Border Patrol agent shot and killed a migrant woman Wednesday in the Texas town of Rio Bravo, setting off an investigation over whether the use of force was justified.\nThe woman, who has not been publicly identified, was traveling with a group of unauthorized immigrants through the border town outside Laredo when a Border Patrol agent confronted them after receiving reports of\xa0“illegal activity,” according to Customs and Border Protection. When the agent tried to apprehend them, some in the group resisted using “blunt objects,” CBP said Thursday.\nThe agent,\xa0who has been with Border Patrol for 15 years, said the group refused to get on the ground and instead rushed at him, CBP said in a second statement on Friday.\xa0The agent fired at least one round that struck the woman in the head and killed her.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the shooting, the agent called for emergency medical services and administered first aid to the woman, according to CBP. Three other unauthorized immigrants on the scene were apprehended later. \nThe FBI and Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting. CBP did not specify whether the three immigrants are in immigration custody slated for deportation or whether they will remain in the U.S. during the investigation.\nNews of the shooting circulated widely after a local resident filmed the aftermath and uploaded it to Facebook. “Why did you shoot at the girl? You killed her!” the woman who filmed the encounter says in Spanish as she approached Border Patrol agents at the scene in the video. “She wasn’t doing anything.”\n\nThe footage appears to show that shooting took place in a neighborhood street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewers had watched the video 3.5 million times by midday Thursday. \nWhile the details of Wednesday’s shooting remain unclear, it highlighted the need for greater accountability, said John-Michael Torres who is with LUPE, a south Texas advocacy group that works with immigrants.\n“One of the big concerns for us is that Border Patrol has avoided so many accountability measures that other law enforcement agencies have adopted, like body cameras,” Torres said. “So when they tell us information about an incident like this, how do we believe what they say?”\xa0\nSince the beginning of 2017, there have been at least two other reported fatal shootings by officers on duty. In November, a CBP agent shot and killed a suspected unauthorized immigrant, who the agency claimed wrested control of another agent’s gun. In September, Border Patrol agents shot and killed a man after a car pursuit and exchanges of gunfire, CBP said. At least seven people have been killed in car accidents since the beginning of 2017 while fleeing border agents.\nCBP reported 17 instances of use of force involving firearms in the 2017 fiscal year and 979 incidents not involving them. The previous year, there were 26 incidents involving firearms and 947 involving other use of force, according to CBP.\nBorder Patrol reported a massive increase in assaults against agents in the 2016 fiscal year, but The Intercept revealed the tally was based on highly unusual counting methods. One incident involving seven Border Patrol agents was counted as 126 assaults. \nPresident Donald Trump is seeking to dramatically expand Border Patrol in a broad crackdown on unauthorized immigration. He ordered the hiring of 5,000 additional agents\xa0as Border Patrol struggles with retention problems and the fact that most applicants fail their background checks.\nKarina Alvarez, a DACA recipient who helped found the community group Laredo Immigrant Alliance, told HuffPost that incidents like Wednesday’s shooting undermine local confidence in law enforcement, especially in light of the president’s ongoing hostile comments about immigrants. \n“Laredo is very safe ― we don’t need a massive amount of border patrol or national guard,” Alvarez said. “They see us as animals. And it’s very frightening to live in a border town now.”\nThis article has been updated to include information from a second statement from Customs and Border Protection.\xa0\n",

  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump attacked the credibility of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation once again\xa0on Sunday, encouraging Republicans and\xa0“real Americans” to start “getting tough” on the federal probe.\nIn a flurry of tweets, Trump bashed the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, claiming it’s a “scam”\xa0that has cost nearly $20 million. Five days earlier,\xa0Trump\xa0tweeted it cost $10 million; the new reference may include the amount his own budget set aside for the probe for the 2019 fiscal year.\nAs he has before, Trump accused the probe’s investigators of being biased against him, claiming they were “13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats.” He failed to mention Mueller is a Republican. In another familiar pattern, his tweets fixated on Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential campaign associates.\nThings are really getting ridiculous.

But in their crusade against the social network’s online monopoly, the usual suspects have enlisted a growing coalition of allies: artists and progressive Muslim and Jewish activists.\nLast week, the Muslim civil rights group MPower Change, the pro-Palestinian nonprofit Jewish Voice for Peace and the artists’ advocacy group Content Creators Coalition joined groups like Open Markets Institute, Demand Progress, Public Citizen and Citizens Against Monopoly in the Freedom from Facebook campaign, which calls for the Federal Trade Commission to break up the social media conglomerate.\nTheir decision highlights just how much trouble Facebook can cause for activists ― and the breadth of the coalition against it.\nRemember, Facebook is not just the website where you wish happy birthday to people you were friends with ten years ago. It’s actually a massive platform conglomerate made up of a multitude of constituent parts. It’s Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Messenger Kids. It’s the Facebook advertising network. It’s the virtual reality platform Oculus and the digital metrics platform CrowdTangle.\n\n\n\n\nLeah Millis / Reuters\n\n\nDozens of cardboard cut-outs of\xa0Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are placed outside of the U.S. Capitol\xa0Building as part of a protest.\n\n\n\nWhen people talk about breaking up Facebook what they mean is dismantling these parts into independent competitors and companies. The\xa0Freedom from Facebook campaign argues that Facebook has a monopoly on social media that poses a threat to both competition and online activism. The campaign asks the Federal Trade Commission to spin off Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into separate companies to compete with the main Facebook site, require social media sites to be interoperable with each other and impose stronger privacy rules to protect consumers.\n“Facebook has allowed hate speech and fake news to fester, censored activists at the behest of certain governments, facilitated law enforcement surveillance, and even actively aided in the distribution of anti-Muslim propaganda,” said Mohammad Khan, the campaign director at MPower Change.\nMembers of MPower Change regularly face harassment on Facebook and so far the company has done little to prevent it, Khan said. And the organization is worried that its members’ privacy and data are particularly at risk since MPower Change activists rely on the whole suite of Facebook properties ― Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.\n“The recent news around Cambridge Analytica highlighted broader issues with Facebook’s inability to protect our data and actively allow for anti-Muslim propaganda to expand on its platform,” Khan added. “With its monopoly power, Facebook is effectively immune to efforts to address these practices.”\nFacebook’s immense power as a platform to censor and control political debates is what motivated Jewish Voice for Peace, a Jewish organization that seeks to end Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, to join the campaign.\n“[Facebook is] an important communication tool for our Palestinian allies in the region, and for Israeli Jews who work for human rights. It’s an important way to organize and amplify what’s happening on the ground,” explained Granate Kim, a spokeswoman for Jewish Voice for Peace. But the organization is concerned that Facebook is already censoring Palestinian pages and users that the Israeli government disapproves of. In 2016, Facebook representatives met with Israeli government officials including the far-right justice minister Ayelet Shaked to discuss which Palestinian pages should be shut down due to “incitement.” Since then, Facebook has proceeded to approve 95 percent of Israel’s shutdown requests. These have included news sites and individual user pages.\nThis is particularly consequential as Facebook is so ubiquitous in the Palestinian territories ― 96 percent of Palestinians use Facebook as their primary news source. Shutting down news pages on the platform can equate to near total viewpoint censorship on the platform.\nJewish Voice for Peace worries that Facebook may consider labeling calls for targeted boycotts, divestments and sanctions against Israeli companies as anti-Semitic hate speech. \xa0Jewish Voice for Peace supports the BDS movement, which favors non-violent economic protest to end the occupation of Palestinian land. But Israel considers the movement anti-Semitic violence and has enacted laws to allow lawsuits to be filed against publishers of BDS messages and banned entry to the country of pro-BDS activists. “We would lose a valuable way to talk about BDS as a nonviolent tool for the movement for Palestinian freedom,” Kim said.\nLike MPower Change, Jewish Voice for Peace activists routinely face anti-Semitic and anti-Palestinian harassment on Facebook that the company rarely counts as violations of its terms of service, Kim said.\n\n\n\n\nAaron Bernstein / Reuters\n\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to testify before a Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees joint hearing regarding the company’s use and protection of user data.\n\n\n\nArtists, too, are getting a raw deal from Facebook, argued Maggie Vail, an executive board member of the Content Creators Coalition, which advocates on behalf of musicians and artists. \nArtists have limited options to reach their audience online, Vail, who is a bass player, DJ, independent record label executive and head of a nonprofit that produces open source tools for musicians, explained. And since Facebook bought up Instagram, Facebook’s products are pretty much the only game in town for artists to reach their fans. By using Facebook to reach their fans, artists are increasing traffic to the platform and help keep user attention on the site, but they aren’t getting anything in return, Vail argued. \xa0“We push people to these outlets, and we can’t access our fans,” she said.\nFacebook takes advantage of its position as the middleman, she noted, and refuses to provide data on fans to the artists, while using that data for itself to target ads on the site. Additionally, in a system she likened to “pay to play,” artists need to spend money on advertising to promote their posts so that their fans will actually see their content in their personal feeds.\n“It used to be easier to find your fans,” Vail concluded. “Since they realized they had to monetize and advertise it’s basically just this game well give us money and then you can access your people.”\nThe Freedom from Facebook campaign is pushing supporters to petition the FTC to break up the company at the same time the commission is investigating whether Facebook violated its 2011 consent decree to protect user privacy after the Cambridge Analytica revelations. One new commissioner, Rohit Chopra, sent a staff memo stating that companies in violation of consent orders “must face severe consequences.” The activist groups aim to put a face on the harms of monopoly as the investigation moves forward.\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415675\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n          }\n\n          \n          \n          \n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(){\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\nfunction resize() {\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\n  if ((!ifr &amp;&amp; box.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; box.offsetHeight &gt; 10) || \n      (ifr &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetHeight &gt; 10)) {\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\n    label.style.display = \'\';\n  } else {\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\n  }\n}\nfor (i=0; i&lt;10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Democrats Want To Boost School Funding To Address Teacher Walkouts',
  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more and more teachers protest their states’ funding cuts, Democrats in Congress say they have a plan to restore school spending and boost teacher pay.\nOn Capitol Hill on Tuesday, party leaders joined teachers’ union officials to promote a slate of policies aimed at addressing the growing number of teacher walkouts that have shaken up statehouses across the country. The measure would steer $100 billion in federal funds toward schools and ensure that teachers could bargain collectively on salaries, benefits and working conditions.\n“We’re here because teachers are marching on state Capitols across the country,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Teachers of America, the Democrats hear you loud and clear.”\nDemocrats said their plan would pay for those investments by paring back some of the tax cuts for the wealthy in the Republican tax package passed by Congress last year and signed by President Donald Trump. Parts of the plan were introduced last year as the Democratic Party’s new “Better Deal” agenda, which is heavy on antitrust and labor law reform. \nThe leaders didn’t specify which parts of the Republican tax plan they would target for repeal, referring only to tax breaks for the rich and special-interest loopholes. At the heart of the Republican plan was a massive corporate tax cut. Although families in all income brackets are expected to have smaller tax bills next year, independent analysts say most of the benefits from the plan\xa0will go to the wealthy. \n“The very wealthiest should not have such a large tax cut,” Schumer said. “I think the odds of something like this [education proposal] passing are large in the next several years\xa0… Our day is going to come sooner than you think.”\nThe Democrats’ plan isn’t going anywhere for now, as Republicans still hold a majority in both chambers and occupy the White House. But the education plan helps Democrats put down a marker before the midterm elections, just as the teacher walkouts have galvanized grassroots activists and spurred a backlash against Republican austerity.\nMost states pulled back on education funding when tax revenues fell during the Great Recession. Spending still hasn’t returned to 2008 levels in certain states, several of which went on to implement tax cuts that left even less money for schools and salaries. The teacher strikes have tended to hit states with the deepest cuts.\n“Republicans are fighting to slash teacher and school budgets. This is one of the dumbest things Republicans have done,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\nThe walkouts began in late February, when West Virginia teachers went on strike to protest low pay, rising health costs and poorly equipped classrooms. The successful work stoppage prompted similar walkouts and school closures in Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona and North Carolina, all with Republican-controlled statehouses that have cut taxes in recent years while school funding has dropped, when adjusted for inflation.\nThe images of striking teachers and crumbling textbooks has prompted several states to increase school funding and teacher pay to varying degrees. Congressional Democrats said it still isn’t enough. Their plan would dedicate $50 billion to states to raise teacher pay and another $50 billion to states to spend on school infrastructure and curriculum.\nAnother, less direct way the plan could boost teacher salaries is through more union contracts. The states that have seen teacher strikes and walkouts tend to have weak labor laws, in some cases even outlawing collective bargaining by public-sector workers. In West Virginia, for instance, the unions have no ability to bargain contracts and guaranteed raises with school districts, only to lobby lawmakers for higher salaries.\nThe Democratic plan would change that by enshrining public-sector workers’ ability to bargain as a group, just like workers in the private sector, through a federal law. Such bills have been proposed in the past but never received enough votes. If Democrats succeed in passing it someday, it’s likely that conservative states would challenge it in court.\xa0\n',

  'body': '\nRather than heavily focusing on brand new content,\xa0Netflix is adding many new episodes of already beloved shows in June.\nThis seems to be the month of second seasons, as more than half of the highlighted shows below are on Season 2.\xa0There’s some clever Netflix marketing going on, as two of these shows wrapped up “first seasons” only a couple months ago that consisted of just a handful of episodes.\nNetflix could have easily considered these “two” seasons as one. But the streaming service is clearly trying to find a way to have the media write about these shows in more than one cycle... and that seems to be working.\nIt’s also worth mentioning that Netflix unexpectedly added four shows in May, so this might not be June’s final lineup.\nAnyway, keep reading for the list of noteworthy shows that are known about so far. And if you want to stay informed on what’s joining Netflix on a weekly basis, make sure to\xa0subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n“Set It Up” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJi Sub Jeong/HP\n\n\n\n\nThis is part of\xa0Streamline, HuffPost’s weekly recommendation service for streaming shows and movies.

Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n“The Staircase” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n“Queer Eye” on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2.

The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n“Luke Cage” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry.

  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is continuing to raise campaign funds off of his defense of President Donald Trump, using a fundraising letter to tout a tweet in which Trump described him as a “Great American Hero” because of Nunes’ work undermining the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nIn the letter, Nunes writes that he’s “standing strong” with Trump and asks for a donation to “take the fight to the liberals.” He writes that he “exposed the real collusion between the Department of Justice, the F.B.I. and the Clinton campaign” through his work as House intelligence committee chairman.\n“When Barack Obama’s Department of Justice and the F.B.I. used Hillary Clinton’s patently false opposition research to justify a warrant to spy on associates of the Trump campaign, I exposed the scandal and brought it to the attention of the entire nation,” Nunes wrote.\nThe top of a fundraising letter sent to an individual in Virginia, which was obtained by HuffPost, promotes a tweet Trump sent about Nunes’ work:\n\n\n\n\nNunes letter\n\n\n\nThat tweet was sent after Nunes appeared on “Fox & Friends” in February, when Nunes falsely said\xa0the president had never met with George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is working with special counsel Robert Mueller’s team.\nNunes says in his letter that he has “earned the hatred of revenge-driven members of the Democratic leadership cabal and the Far Left media.” He said he has faced an “onslaught of lies, propaganda, attacks, slurs and smears,” that Democrats had “come unhinged” in their attacks on him and that he was up against “liars, propagandists and hypocrites from the Far Left fringe.”\n\n\n\n\nNunes letter\n\n\n\nNunes’ campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.\xa0\nIn November’s midterm election, Nunes faces Democrat Andrew Janz, a deputy district attorney in Fresno County who raised more than $1 million in the first quarter, much of it from Democrats upset over the so-called Nunes memo and his attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. The final report from Nunes’ committee released last month attempted to clear Trump of wrongdoing.\n“It’s clear my opponent is only interested in pleasing the President,” Janz told HuffPost in a statement. “He takes great satisfaction in voting against our interests and stands by devastating tariffs placed on our farmers to serve Trump and his billionaire buddies. There’s nothing heroic about that.”\xa0\nNunes’ seat in the House no longer considered a “safe Republican” seat, according to Sabato’s Crystal Ball.\nLiz Mair, a Republican strategist with the Swamp Accountability Project, a group that is running ads against Nunes,\xa0called the letter “mostly a political stunt undertaken to beef up direct mail appeals to rich Beltway donors to try to help him get through a tough cycle in which he faces a potentially viable opponent for the first time in a long time”\n“Nunes is positioning as an opponent of the ‘Deep State’ as a matter of political convenience because a Democrat has made his district potentially competitive, and Nunes is not well-liked among California conservatives— another reason why he has to ask for money in Virginia,”\xa0she said.\xa0\nThis article has been updated with comment from Mair.\xa0\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

  'body': '\nHonoring the Yale University tradition of wearing funky hats on graduation day, this year’s commencement speaker Hillary Clinton took the stage with a hat of her own ― a Russian fur hat, undoubtedly a swipe at President Donald Trump and the accusations that his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.\xa0\n“I brought a hat too ... a Russian hat,” she told the students on Sunday as they whooped and cheered. “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.”\nClinton, a graduate of Yale Law School, offered a poignant address that encouraged graduates to channel their resilience and contribute meaningfully to the future of democracy.\xa0\nShe jokingly made references to the scandals that engulfed her campaign, noting that she made sure to bury a tape of her singing acapella during her Yale days so deeply, she quipped, that not even WikiLeaks would be able to find it.\xa0\n“If you thought my emails were scandalous you should hear my singing voice,” she said.\xa0\nShe congratulated all of the students in the room, saying, “Even the three of you who live in Michigan and didn’t request your absentee ballots in time.”\nClinton also made several mentions of her searing election loss. “No, I’m still not over it,” she said. “I still think about the 2016 election, I still regret the mistakes I made.”\nAs a human being, she added, she is coping with what happened. But as an American, she’s concerned.\xa0“We’re living through a time when fundamental rights, civic virtue, freedom of the press, even facts and reason are under assault like never before.”\nYet she did highlight the unprecedented levels of political and civic mobilization that have been kicked into gear since Trump’s victory, efforts she believes will help to defend democracy.\xa0“We are also witnessing an era of new moral conviction, civic engagement, and a sense of devotion to our democracy and country.”\nShe urged students to demonstrate resilience even in simple ways, like in calling out fake news or subscribing to a newspaper to support quality journalism. And “as obvious as it seems, it means voting,” she added. “At this moment in our history, our country depends on every citizen believing in the power of their actions even when that power is invisible and their efforts feel like an uphill battle.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nThe 17-year-old who killed 10 people last week at his high school in Santa Fe, Texas, was too young to buy a gun, but he didn’t have to look far to find one.\nOn Friday morning, he took his father’s pump-action shotgun and .38 revolver, concealed them under a trench coat and walked into an art class before opening fire on students, teachers and a responding school resource officer.\nAuthorities haven’t released further details about how the gunman was able to access the weapons, but in the aftermath of the massacre, people from across the political spectrum have stressed the importance of securing firearms to keep minors and others from getting ahold of them without permission.\n“If you’re a parent and you own guns, lock your guns safely away,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a staunch pro-gun Republican, said at a press conference on Friday. “It’s a serious issue and one big step we can take.”\nEd Scruggs,\xa0a board member of Texas Gun Sense, a nonprofit focused on gun violence prevention,\xa0offered similar advice.\n“If you have minors in the house, the guns should be secured, because anything just laying out is a risk,” Scruggs told HuffPost.\nAdvocates on both sides of the gun debate appear to have found some elusive common ground in promoting safe and responsible firearm ownership, an issue that nationwide studies suggest is a worthy cause.\nA\xa0survey published earlier this year\xa0found that most gun owners don’t safely store all of their firearms in a locked container,\xa0such as a safe or gun case, or with a trigger lock device. Among households with children under 18, 55 percent of gun owners said they did.\nSome 4.6 million kids live in a home with a firearm that is unlocked and loaded,\xa0according to a\xa0recently published study. Those guns frequently end up in children’s hands,\xa0leading to suicides, fatal accidents\xa0and a number of recent school shooting events.\nAlthough Texans may agree on the need to confront the issue of unsecured guns,\xa0they don’t agree on the best way to do it.\nTexas is one of 27 states, as well as Washington, D.C.,\xa0that attempts to compel gun owners to store their firearms properly with a\xa0child access prevention law, which allows prosecutors to charge adults with misdemeanor criminal negligence when a child under 17 obtains a “readily dischargeable” firearm from their property. Because the suspect in the Santa Fe shooting is 17,\xa0the law may not apply in this case. The Galveston County District Attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would pursue charges against the gunman’s father.\nRecent reports have called the effectiveness of the 1995 law into question. There were only 61 convictions statewide under the statute in its first 20 years,\xa0according to\xa02015 review by the Austin-American Statesman. Gun control experts say prosecutors may be hesitant to bring charges against individuals who may already be coping with a tragedy after a child’s shooting. They’ve also\xa0criticized the law\xa0because it doesn’t explicitly mandate safe storage practices and is typically only used after a tragedy has happened.\nTo Scruggs, that’s proof the state should strengthen\xa0the law and clarify the circumstances in which it would be applied.\n“Right now, the state really does very little, if anything, to encourage the safe and secure storage of firearms at all,” Scruggs said.\xa0“It’s not really a gun rights issue, it’s just a gun issue and we shouldn’t be afraid to discuss it.”\nLast legislative session, Texas Gun Sense and other gun violence prevention groups also worked to launch a statewide education and public awareness campaign around gun safety,\xa0which would’ve used funds from the state’s handgun licensing fees.\nGun rights groups opposed the measure, and it failed to make it out of committee.\nAlice Tripp, legislative director of the NRA-affiliated Texas State Rifle Association, said the push for a new gun safety program was a “noble goal,” but that the legislature shouldn’t be responsible for paying for it.\n“They can do what the rest of us do: Work your tail off, make money and give it to create it,” she told HuffPost. “You don’t do it through law and legislature and through tax funding.”\nUnder federal law, every handgun sold by a licensed dealer must be accompanied with a trigger lock or other safety\xa0or storage device.\xa0Those rules don’t apply to private sales between individuals. Firearm manufacturers also include basic safety information in the owner’s manuals that come with their products.\nBut Massachusetts is the only state that actually requires all firearms to be stored with a locking device in place when not in use.\nIn an interview on Sunday, Patrick wouldn’t commit to supporting a stronger law on gun storage, insisting that Texas already “holds you responsible if you’re a gun owner.”\xa0\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick on gun safety: “A gun ownership ... that comes with responsibility of gun control in your home” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/HcWwFsu65x— CNN (@CNN) May 20, 2018\n\n\nTripp said she opposes a more stringent safe storage law in Texas, and questioned whether police would even be able to enforce such a measure. She pointed to existing safety programs provided by groups like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s lobbying association,\xa0and said that a large part of gun safety ultimately comes down to “parental logic.”\n“You don’t leave out poison or medications,” she said. “Nobody has to tell me not to store my car keys in my ignition, but there are people that do that.”\nBut Tripp said she supported Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s plans to convene a roundtable discussion on gun violence and school safety following the Santa Fe shooting, an announcement that some saw as a surprise coming from a Republican who has long opposed any talk of gun control.\xa0She said she hoped to see them cover a number of proposals, including potential changes to the state’s child access prevention law.\n“If it needs to be a stronger penalty, then that needs to be discussed. But if it’s not being used at all, then how come?” she said. “Nothing can be off the table.”\nIn the meantime, Scruggs said gun owners can take it upon themselves to begin an honest conversation around safe storage and keeping firearms out of the hands of their children.\n“Maybe people grew up in a house with hunting guns and other guns available, but they need to realize that we’re living in a different time,” he said. “We can never be too safe.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nDonald Trump’s former campaign adviser Roger Stone\xa0pressured an acquaintance to ask\xa0WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\xa0for “damaging” emails on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\nStone has long denied any involvement with the trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails that WikiLeaks published\xa0during the 2016 campaign. He also testified before the House Intelligence Committee last year that he only “wanted confirmation” that Assange had information about Trump’s opponent.\nBut according to a series of emails The Wall Street Journal reviewed for its Thursday article, Stone did more than ask for confirmation. In September 2016, he apparently badgered radio personality Randy Credico to press Assange for emails related to Clinton’s alleged role in disrupting a purported Libyan peace deal while she was secretary of state.\nCredico reportedly emailed back that Stone should check the WikiLeaks website for the information he wanted, since WikiLeaks had already posted the hacked DNC emails that July. According to the Journal, Stone responded: “Why do we assume WikiLeaks has released everything they have???”\nCredico reportedly wrote to Stone that the Libya information would likely be in a “batch probably coming out in the next drop,” presumably meaning in the next set of hacked emails WikiLeaks published.\n“I can’t ask them favors every other day,” Credico complained, according to the Journal. “I asked one of his lawyers ... they have major legal headaches ... relax.”\xa0\nStone became so insistent that Credico told the Journal that he “got tired” of Stone “bothering” him. Credico said he didn’t even pass along Stone’s message to Assange, whom he had interviewed for his radio program, but still told Stone that he had.\nStone tweeted during the election that he had a “back channel” to Assange, which could have meant Credico. He soon deleted the tweet.\nIn response to the Journal’s story, Stone sent a text message claiming that Credico and WikiLeaks had “provided nothing” to him and that his testimony before the House intelligence committee was “complete and accurate.”\nInvestigators have scrutinized Stone for his claims that he communicated with both Assange and Guccifer 2.0, the Kremlin operative identified by U.S. officials as responsible for the DNC hack.\nStone also appeared to know about WikiLeaks’ actions in advance. The day before WikiLeaks published hacked emails of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, Stone said Assange was going to deliver “a devastating expose of Hillary.” The emails were published the day the “Access Hollywood” tape was released of Trump boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.\nStone said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press” that he was prepared for an indictment as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with the Russian government.\xa0The Mueller team may “conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business,” Stone said. But he insisted he would not be charged with Russian collusion.\nMueller’s team has not yet talked to Stone. But Stone told “Meet The Press” that eight of his former colleagues had been “terrorized” by investigators.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Stone Says He’s ‘Prepared’ For ‘Conjured Up’ Mueller Indictment\n\n\n\n\n\nMueller Hits Roger Stone’s Social Media Advisor With Subpoenas\n\n\n\n\n\nCombative Trump Adviser Roger Stone Denies Involvement With Fake Facebook Ads\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Has A Field Day After Trump Adviser Wears ‘Cat Burglar’ Outfit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Obamacare Premiums Will Be Way Higher Next Year. They Didn’t Have To Be.',
  'body': '\nIf you buy your own health insurance, gird yourself for another round of big premium increases next year.\nHealth insurance companies have begun submitting requests for rate hikes to state regulators in a handful of states, and it’s not looking pretty based on information that Maryland, Virginia, Oregon and Vermont have already made public. Double-digit premium increases again appear to be on the horizon for many consumers. \nAnd according to what these insurers are telling states, those rate hikes wouldn’t be nearly as big if not for actions President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress have taken.\nThe biggest change was the repeal of the financial penalty for people who don’t comply with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. Although the mandate may have been less effective than the health law’s authors expected, insurers are nervous that taking away that incentive to get covered will result in fewer healthy customers, meaning less revenue to cover the costs of the sicker people who will remain in the market. That alone will account for 10 percent premium increases overall, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nIn addition, the Trump administration is working to relax federal regulations to permit insurance companies to offer policies that don’t abide by the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions and offer skimpier benefits. Insurers are concerned that healthy people will flock to these cheaper products, weakening the precarious balance between healthy and sick people in the exchange markets.\n\nIn the absence of efforts to undermine the market, we would be seeing a period of relatively small premium increases.\nCynthia Cox, Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nThe combined result of these actions will be much higher health insurance costs in 2019. On average, the new policies Trump and Congress have enacted will add $1,013 to unsubsidized annual premiums next year, an increase of 16.4 percent above what rates would have been, according to an analysis\xa0published Friday by the liberal Center for American Progress.\nIt didn’t have to been this way. After three years of overall poor financial performance among health insurers on the exchanges that drove big premium hikes,\xa0the marketplace had mostly stabilized in 2017, according to a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation analysis published Thursday.\n“In the absence of efforts to undermine the market, we would be seeing a period of relatively small premium increases, driven mostly by the underlying growth in health care costs,” said Cynthia Cox, the lead author of the Kaiser Family Foundation report. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we’re in for another year of double-digit premium increases. And if that does happen, it would be in large part due to policy changes that are happening.”\nPremiums for policies available on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchanges have been rising since they began in 2014. What’s changed is who’s running them and how they’re managing a system that provides health coverage to nearly 12 million people.\nRates have risen each year of the exchanges’ existence, and cumulatively are more than 50 percent higher this year than they were four years ago. That’s according to a separate Kaiser Family Foundation analysis that looks at the average premium for the “benchmark” plans used to establish the value of the tax credit subsidies available to exchange customers who earn between the federal poverty level and four times that amount, or $12,060 to $48,240 for a single person.\nBut the reasons for these increases have changed over time.\nDuring the first two open enrollment periods for exchange customers for 2014 and 2015, many Americans who previously bought their insurance directly ― as opposed to getting it from a job or a government program like Medicaid ― were stunned to see prices that generally were higher than before.\nThat mostly was the result of the Affordable Care Act requiring insurers to accept customers with pre-existing conditions (who tend to be more expensive to treat) and establishing a basic set of benefits that includes coverage for things often left out in the past, such as maternity care and prescription drugs, Cox said. \nIn 2016 and 2017, insurers implemented big price increases after realizing they hadn’t charged enough the previous two years to cover their expenses, and to make up for the end of Affordable Care Act programs designed to protect insurance companies from unexpectedly high costs. \nAs the Kaiser Family Foundation determined, rate hikes would’ve been smaller this year and in future years ― even though prices would’ve remained high ― if the market had been left as it was, Cox said.\n“The 2017 premium increase was a one-time market correction that was needed in order for insurers to regain profitability, and the 2018 and possibly 2019 premium increases are due to something else,” Cox said. “They would’ve regained that profitability by now and it’s the political or policy changes that are driving premium increases.”\n\n\n\n\nHenry J. Kaiser Family Foundation\n\n\n“Medical loss ratio” is a measure of the financial performance\xa0for health\xa0insurance companies. The\xa0number is higher when a larger\xa0percentage of premiums collected is spent on medical care. After rising\xa0over the 2014-2016 period, the average medical loss ratio for insurers on the health insurance exchanges nearly returned to its pre-Affordable Care Act level in 2017.\n\n\n\nSomething else happened instead. Premiums rose a lot for this year. The Trump administration significantly cut back on enrollment efforts. Sign-ups fell on the health insurance exchanges. And the uninsured rate began climbing last year after falling to a historic low.\nHealth insurance companies instituted big premium increases for 2018 in anticipation of Trump’s plan to cut off billions of dollars in repayments the federal government owed health insurers covering the lowest-income exchange customers. Insurers also reacted to Trump’s comments in 2017 that hinted his administration wouldn’t fully enforce the individual mandate.\nAs the evidence from the open enrollment period for 2018 indicates, the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies will protect most people in this market from the rate hikes. The way they’re structured, the subsidies rise along with the premiums and tax credit recipients’ share of the premiums is capped at a percentage of their income. \nEighty-three percent of the 11.8 million people who enrolled in an exchange plan qualified for subsidies. It’s the remaining 17 percent of unsubsidized exchange customers and the several million more people who bought their policies directly from an insurer would are exposed to the increasingly higher rates.\nThe Trump administration argues that these are the people who will benefit from the availability of new types of coverage that don’t meet Affordable Care Act standards. And that’s likely true for healthy people who don’t need the coverage as much but earn too much income to be eligible for tax credits. Plus, the end of the mandate penalties makes it so people can choose these other policies and not face fines.\nWhile that means there will be winners from these policy changes, they will weaken the exchange markets, which is especially bad news for people with incomes too high for subsidies but who have pre-existing conditions.\n“The combination of no individual mandate plus plans that may be attractive to healthy people and aren’t attractive to sick people can mean that the market can deteriorate progressively over time,” Cox said. Even so, the subsidies will keep enough healthy, low-income people in the pool to prevent the exchanges from collapsing, she said.\nVoters tell pollsters that health care costs are a major issue for them going into this year’s congressional elections and\xa0Democrats are aggressively campaigning against Trump’s “sabotage” of the Affordable Care Act. \nThere’s likely little relief on the way from the federal government, but several states are attempting to stabilize their local markets. The New Jersey and Vermont legislatures have approved state-based individual mandates like the one in force in Massachusetts since 2007. And states including Alaska, Maryland, Minnesota and Wisconsin have passed laws designed to mitigate premium increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'White House Officials Reportedly Considered Just ‘Ignoring’ New Climate Research',
  'body': '\nThe Trump administration spent time last year mulling over what its public position on climate science should be — and, according to a report published Wednesday by The Washington Post, outrightly “ignoring” new research was one option that officials considered.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting an internal memo drafted in September by President Donald Trump’s then-top energy and environmental aide, Michael Catanzaro, the Post reported that White House officials had discussed whether to “consider having a firm position on and a coherent, fact-based message about climate science ― specifically, whether, and to what extent, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are affecting the climate system, and what level of concern that warrants.”\nThree options were reportedly presented in the memo: The first was to conduct\xa0 “red team/blue team”\xa0debates to “highlight uncertainties” in climate data; the second was to review scientific studies under the Administrative Procedure Act; and the final option was to simply “ignore, and not seek to characterize or question, the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities.”\xa0\nAn option to endorse scientists’ findings was not put on the table.\xa0\nNo formal policy ever did materialize from the memo or subsequent discussions on the issue. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt was reportedly an advocate of holding “red team/blue team”\xa0debates to publicly critique climate science, but that idea was\xa0ultimately blocked by the White House, reported The New York Times in March.\nRemember that “red team, blue team” debate on climate change that Scott Pruitt proposed for E.P.A.? Here’s who killed it (at least for now).https://t.co/MDn5rCC8Qg— NYT Climate (@nytclimate) March 9, 2018\n\n\nAs the Post noted, the Catanzaro memo offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by the Trump administration on the issue of climate change.\xa0While White House officials continue to publicly downplay climate data and adopt policies to expand fossil fuel production in the U.S., federal agencies have continued to publish research showing that climate change is real, man-made and a growing threat to the U.S.\nOn Friday, for instance, the National Park Service published a report that said the effects of climate change, like rising sea levels and intensifying storms,\xa0could damage park sites across the country. The report’s lead researcher had earlier accused the Trump administration of attempting to censor the study by removing all mentions of human-caused climate change.\nFollowing public outrage, the paper was quietly published with the climate change references intact.\xa0\nOn Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers reacted with fury to the Post’s report.\n“Unacceptable and immoral,” wrote Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) on Twitter.\xa0\n“Ignoring the overwhelming evidence only sets us back further in addressing this serious threat,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).\xa0\n“Ignore,” distort, or censor. Those are the options the Trump White House is considering to deal with the overwhelming consensus on climate change. Unacceptable and immoral. We need a vision and a plan to #ActOnClimate, not willful ignorance. https://t.co/cT6O0sxXvX— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) May 24, 2018\n\n\nClimate change is real.

 {'title': 'Freedom Caucus Sinks Key Part Of Paul Ryan’s Welfare Reform Agenda',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― Republicans failed to come up with the votes Friday to pass a major piece of their domestic policy agenda, with a farm bill rewrite dramatically going down on the House floor after a number of conservatives made a last-minute decision to oppose the legislation.\nThe bill, which fell short 198-213 with 30 Republicans voting no and no Democrats voting yes, had shaky support all week, but it had looked like it could get just enough votes Friday morning after House Freedom Caucus leaders appeared to be close to a deal on immigration with GOP leaders and moderates.\nBy the time the vote was called, however, conservative leaders in the Freedom Caucus said not enough progress had been made on the compromise, and a key number of them joined about a dozen moderate Republicans to sink the bill. (House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also ended up voting against the bill for procedural purposes of bringing the bill back up.)\nThe Freedom Caucus had withheld its support of the farm bill all week as a point of leverage over immigration, as Republicans sign a discharge petition for a vote on a slate of immigration proposals with the intention of passing a proposal that almost all Democrats would support.\nConservatives initially believed they could stymie the discharge petition\xa0― which is used to bring a piece of legislation to the floor when leaders refuse to give a vote to a bill with majority support ― by holding a vote on part of the legislative vehicle for the petition itself. But it became clear later in the week that their plan wouldn’t actually stop the petition.\nSo the Freedom Caucus shifted its focus toward working out an agreement on an actual immigration bill that could pass muster with GOP moderates and conservatives.\nRepublican leaders tried to work out that deal with the Freedom Caucus, and conservatives said Friday morning that they felt there’d been significant progress. Minutes before the final vote was called, as the House voted on amendments to the farm bill, leaders were still negotiating with the Freedom Caucus to try and find some agreement on immigration that would push the farm bill over the top.\nBut that deal never quite materialized, and just before the final vote came, leaders decided their best chance of passing the bill was to abandon talking with the Freedom Caucus and work individual members to try and pressure them to flip.\nUltimately, leaders didn’t get close enough, and the bill fell short by a number of votes. (Leadership would have had to flip eight Republicans to pass the bill.)\nLeaders can still pick up the bill next week. And under House rules, a motion to reconsider the bill would have to be brought up within two legislative days, though Republicans could always bring up the bill under a separate rule at any time. This likely isn’t the end for this farm bill. \nBut Friday’s failure is an embarrassing defeat for Republican leaders, and it leaves immigration negotiations in a strange place. Republicans who wanted the farm bill may now be less inclined to support a hard-line immigration bill, and more inclined to sign on to the discharge petition. And Freedom Caucus members have now taken a firm line that they won’t support the farm bill for vague immigration promises.\nConservatives were lukewarm to the farm bill as it stood. The bill includes significant amounts of farm subsidies for rural businesses and reauthorizes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to get buy-in from more urban lawmakers. Democrats and moderate Republicans opposed the bill on the grounds that the SNAP cuts it included were too drastic.\nThe bill would require a greater number of adults receiving SNAP benefits to work at least 20 hours per week or enroll in training. The stricter requirement would therefore reduce food stamp enrollment ― which has already been on a steady decline ― by an additional 1.2 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \n\n\n\n\nBill Clark via Getty Images\n\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) holds his weekly press conference in the Capitol on May 17.\n\n\n\nEchoing businesses in their districts, Ryan and other Republicans said denying benefits to some adults would make it easier for companies to hire ― which is another way of saying\xa0the bill would help keep wages down. \xa0\nThere’s no way to reduce welfare enrollment without being “harsh,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said during a committee session on Wednesday. Grothman supported even harsher SNAP reforms and added that some welfare recipients provide “a bad role model for their children.”\nRep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) responded, “Some of the best mothers in the world are poor mothers and some of the worst mothers in the world are rich mothers.”\nThe bill directly targets poor parents. Under current law, adults 18-49 who don’t have minor children are subject to the work requirement, which is waived in many areas due to above-average unemployment. The legislation would make the waivers more difficult for states to obtain, and would broaden the requirement to people in their 50s and parents of minor children older than 6. The bill would also create a new training program in which SNAP recipients could enroll for a limited time in order to meet the requirement.\nWhile the bill makes it more difficult for some people to obtain SNAP benefits, certain farmers and their relatives would become newly eligible for farm subsidies that can add up to $125,000 annually per person. One provision would exempt certain types of farm businesses from an income limit that disallows married households from obtaining subsidies if their annual income exceeds $1.8 million.\nRepublicans also defeated a bipartisan amendment that would have reformed the sugar program, which benefits sugar producers by guaranteeing a minimum price for the commodity. Sugar welfare is the most reviled agribusiness giveaway in the farm bill. Unlike other farm programs, it has well-financed opposition from food makers that use sugar as an ingredient.\nBut even this small effort to rein in farm subsidies was easily defeated on the House floor Thursday. Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) said the amendment would only “line the pockets of these multinational soda pop makers and candy makers.”\nNothing in the bill can become law unless it can also pass the Senate, where agriculture committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) has already said he won’t support anything that can’t win acceptance from at least some of his Democratic colleagues.\nIn the end, all the haggling over a new five-year reauthorization might be irrelevant and lawmakers from both chambers could just agree to a one-year extension of current policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Giuliani’s New Stance On Russian Collusion: So What? It’s Not Illegal.',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― His client\xa0insists\xa0there was “NO COLLUSION” with Russia to win the presidency, but Donald Trump’s lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has a new theory of the case: What’s the big deal if he did?\nIn a recent interview with HuffPost, Giuliani initially disputed the notion that Trump’s daily citing, in the final month of his campaign, of Russian-aligned WikiLeaks and its release of Russian-stolen emails constituted “colluding” with Russia.\n“It is not,”\xa0Giuliani said.\nThen he switched tacks.\n“OK, and if it is, it isn’t illegal... It was sort of like a gift,” he said. “And you’re not involved in the illegality of getting it.”\nWhile much of the recent attention on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s efforts to elect Trump has focused on meetings between the Trump campaign and individuals linked to Russian officials, a big piece of “collusion” evidence has been in plain sight all along.\nAs the GOP nominee, Trump started receiving U.S. intelligence briefings on Aug. 17, 2016 ― at which time, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump would have learned that analysts had concluded that Russia was behind the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and was releasing them through WikiLeaks. That group, which bills itself as a “transparency” organization, has for years been considered an arm of Russian spy agencies by the U.S. intelligence community.\nOn Oct. 7, 2016, U.S. intelligence went public with their analysis about Russia and WikiLeaks. “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,” said the statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nYou say stolen. I say, emails that were put out in the public domain. You’d also have to believe that U.S. intelligence was correct. They’ve been right about a lot of things. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things. I certainly wouldn’t trust Clapper or Brennan as far as I could throw them.\nRudy Giuliani\n\nTrump, though, ignored all of that information. Instead, starting just three days later as WikiLeaks began releasing batches of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Trump began praising WikiLeaks in campaign speeches and interviews and urging Americans to read the emails for themselves.\n“WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks,” Trump told an audience in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 10.\n“It’s just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign really has for everyday Americans and you see, and you see so much from these WikiLeaks,” Trump said in Panama City, Florida, the following day.\n“I’ll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable,” Trump said on Oct. 12 in Ocala, Florida. “It tells you the inner heart. You’ve got to read it and you’ve got to maybe get it, because they’re not putting it out.”\nThat was the same day the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent a direct message to Trump’s son\xa0Donald Jr., asking his father to highlight the stolen emails and offering a web link for Trump to advertise. Fifteen minutes after that direct message, candidate Trump sent out a tweet praising WikiLeaks. Two days later, Trump Jr.\xa0sent out the link WikiLeaks had provided.\nTrump continued citing WikiLeaks and their stolen emails right through Election Day, as did others in his campaign. Giuliani, a campaign adviser who frequently appeared with Trump at rallies, himself cited WikiLeaks on Oct. 9 in a CBS News interview ― just two days after the intelligence community’s statement about Russia’s involvement.\nHuffPost contacted more than half a dozen Trump campaign officials for this story. Not one was willing to explain why Trump knowingly and repeatedly ― more than 160 times, according to Politifact\xa0― cited documents stolen by Russian intelligence agencies in the final month before the election. The White House did not respond to HuffPost’s queries on the matter.\nGiuliani said he is still not convinced the emails were stolen by Russia, and that he is unwilling to accept the word of former CIA Director John Brennan or former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n“You say stolen. I say, emails that were put out in the public domain,” Giuliani said. “You’d also have to believe that U.S. intelligence was correct. They’ve been right about a lot of things. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things. I certainly wouldn’t trust Clapper or Brennan as far as I could throw them.”\nClapper\xa0on Wednesday\xa0defended the assessment he oversaw. “The intelligence community assessment on the Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election was prepared by about two dozen of the best analytic experts on Russia\xa0 drawn from CIA, NSA, the FBI, and ODNI,” he told HuffPost. “It is regrettable that the president and his surrogates spend so much time attacking the messengers who were attempting to convey truth to power about the profound threat to our country by Russia, and spend virtually no time or display no sense of urgency about countering that threat.”\nAttacking those messengers was something Trump began doing just two days after that Oct. 7, 2016 statement, after he was challenged about his continual praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the presidential debates.\nOn Oct. 9, at the second debate, Trump disputed the U.S. intelligence assessment. “She doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking,” Trump said of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.”\nEleven days later, at the third and final debate: “She has no idea whether it’s Russia, China or anybody else,” Trump repeated. “And our country has no idea.”\nSince the election, the U.S. intelligence community and the Senate intelligence committee have both released reports stating what intelligence analysts concluded in the summer of 2016: Not only was Russia interfering in the election in coordination with WikiLeaks, but it was doing so with the goal of electing Trump.\n“Those are simply the facts,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the ranking member of that committee. “So Mr. Giuliani could not be more wrong. Make no mistake, these are dangerous efforts aimed at distracting us from the truth and they have the chilling effect of dismissing the seriousness of the Russian threat.”\nFormer acting CIA Director John McLaughlin agreed. “Giuliani is just wrong on that point,” he said. “Either Trump simply didn’t care that this material came from the Russians, or was so foolish and naïve to think that it was OK to use it, or, and it’s a big ‘or,’ that he did so knowing full well that he was cooperating with the Russians.”\nOne former Trump campaign staffer said he believes he understands exactly why Trump and his team used the Russian-provided material: They were desperate and decided they would use it and worry about consequences later.\n“I don’t think they were working with them. I think they were willing to take advantage of it. It’s about winning,” said Sam Nunberg, who had been fired by Trump more than a year before the election. “You’re supposed to win. That’s just the reality of it.”\nThis has been updated to include Clapper’s comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nA business partner of U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in investigations, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.\nEvgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant who is known as the Taxi King, will avoid jail time and will assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, the newspaper report said, citing a person briefed on the matter.\nThe New York State Attorney General’s Office said in a press release that Freidman had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge on Tuesday in an Albany, New York, courtroom, but it made no mention of whether he was cooperating with prosecutors.\nFreidman has been Cohen’s partner in the taxi business for years, even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage taxi medallions, the New York Times said.\nFreidman, when asked by Reuters about the report, declined in a text message to answer any questions about cooperating with prosecutors or the terms of his agreement.\n“This is me taking responsibility for my actions! ... Michael is a dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That’s it! ...I hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of!” Freidman said by text.\nFreidman’s lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to comment on the Times report.\nFreidman had been accused of failing to pay more than $5 million in taxes and five other criminal counts each carrying maximum prison sentences of up to 25 years. In pleading guilty to a single count of criminal tax fraud, Freidman will be sentenced to five years’ probation, the attorney general’s office said.\nA spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFederal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump’s presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.\nThe investigation into Cohen arose in part from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, something that Trump has repeatedly denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Twitter Bots May Have Delivered Donald Trump’s Victory, Research Paper Says',
  'body': '\nTwitter bots could have swayed the presidential election enough to account for Donald Trump’s margin of victory, according to new research.\nAutomated tweeting played a small but potentially decisive role in Trump’s win, according to a working paper released by the nonprofit\xa0National Bureau of Economic Research. The research suggests that bots touting Trump or attacking rival Hillary Clinton could have accounted for 3.23 percentage points of the vote for president, putting Trump over the top. Clinton won the popular vote, and a small added margin in critical districts could have put her over the top in some states and affected the Electoral College total.\nThe research also suggests that the bots may have handed Brexit a win by influencing just 1.76 percent of the tally.\n“Our results suggest that, given narrow margins of victories in each vote, bots’ effect was likely marginal but possibly large enough to affect the outcomes,” said the paper’s authors, Yuriy Gorodnichenko from the University of California at Berkeley and Tho Pham and Oleksandr Talavera from the U.K.’s Swansea University.\nU.S. security officials have said the Kremlin attempted to sway the election for Trump via social media, using bots to inflate the impact of the messages. The research was an attempt to determine a concrete effect of bots on the 2016 presidential election and Brexit vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers amassed a database of tweets starting a month before the election. They identified human tweets vs.\xa0bots and examined how closely votes were correlated with pro-Trump Twitter activity in particular areas. They then calculated how much the accounts they defined as bots added to the volume of tweets that supported Trump.\nBut some experts have criticized the research, saying it doesn’t have evidence to back up the assumption that pro-Trump tweets actually influenced voters.\nThat’s right: they find that states that tweet more positively about Trump votes more for Trump and then assumed that this is a causal relationship from tweets to votes to say that bots increases Trump vote share by over 3%. This is absurd and reckless! (8/9)— Sean Ehrlich (@SeanDEhrlich) May 22, 2018\n\n\nThe working paper found that bots were most effective when they backed up a target’s prior opinion. Trump supporters, for example, tended to react to and spread messages sent by pro-Trump bots. Also, tweets with a “high degree of emotionality” reached a wider readership and were more likely to be disseminated, according to the paper. Pro-Trump tweets steadily outnumbered pro-Clinton tweets in the period examined, except for the final few days into the election, the research found.\nThe New York Times reported earlier this year on research showing what little effect bot tweets likely had on voters’ ballots.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nMaxim Shemetov/Reuters\n\n\nU.S. security officials have said\xa0the Russian government attempted to sway the election for Trump via social media, using bots to inflate the impact of the messages. New research shows how much bots may have influenced voters.\n\n\n\nIn January, Twitter told Congress that 50,000 automated bot accounts linked to Russia retweeted Trump messages almost 500,000 times between September and November 2016 — nearly 10 times the number of their retweets for Clinton. Russian bots were also responsible for 200,000 retweets of WikiLeaks’ Twitter account during the same period when WikiLeaks published unflattering Democratic National Committee emails obtained by Russian hackers.\nGiven the effect the bots may have had on the election outcome, the working paper’s authors suggest that bot control should be considered for future elections.\n“Cherishing diversity does not mean that one should allow dumping lies and manipulations to the extent that the public cannot make a well-informed decision,” the paper concludes. “Where one should draw the line (e.g., disclose ultimate owners of accounts, improve media literacy, introduce a ‘code of practice’ for social networks) is a central question for society.”\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Opens Door For U.S. Gun Industry To Sell More Firearms Abroad',
  'body': '\nThe Trump administration is forging ahead with a previously sidelined plan to allow U.S. gun manufacturers sell their products abroad more cheaply and easily.\nThe proposed rule, published Thursday in the Federal Register, would shift control of U.S. firearm exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department, in a move the regulatory language said is aimed at reducing “procedural burdens and costs” on American gunmakers doing international business.\nThe plan would also save the U.S. government money by simplifying the licensing process, according to the proposal.\nAs a result, gun companies would likely be able to expand foreign sales of popular civilian firearms and accessories that have attracted controversy in the U.S. These include semi-automatic military-style guns like AR-15s, .50 caliber rifles, scopes and certain high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nThat would be a boon to an industry that has experienced sharp declines in sales since Donald Trump’s won the White House in 2016, after years of record sales driven by fears that former President Barack Obama would tighten gun laws. The Obama administration had mulled a similar export plan during his first term, but abandoned it following the 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.\nIf the rule change takes effect, foreign arms sales are expected to increase as much as 20 percent, according to the National Sports Shooting Foundation, the gun industry’s trade association. Other arms trade experts have predicted a much smaller boost.\nBut the plan has also raised concerns among foreign policy experts and some Democratic lawmakers who say that the reduced oversight under the new system could increase gun violence in other nations by putting more powerful weaponry in the hands of human rights abusers and criminal factions, as well as the civilian population.\nDirect civilian access to U.S.-made weapons would depend on their nations’ gun laws.\n\nIt was already problematic, and now all the indicators are that the gates will open and there won’t be any controls on who gets weapons that are legally exported.\nJohn Lindsay-Poland, gun violence researcher\n\nUnder the current version of the Arms Export Control Act, the State Department issues licenses and attempts to monitor the flow of U.S. firearms, including who ultimately receives exported guns. Larger arms exports are also subject to scrutiny from Congress and the public, a system that has at times effectively prevented firearms from ending up in the hands of corrupt governments, terrorist organizations and especially violent foreign law enforcement bodies.\nIn 2016, for instance, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) blocked a proposed arms export deal between the U.S. and the Philippines, amid reports of human rights abuses by that nation’s police forces.\xa0\nThe Commerce Department, critics of the proposed rule change said, lacks any of the infrastructure or oversight ability to properly monitor what happens to U.S.-made weapons once they leave the country.\n“When it comes to Commerce, the inspection program isn’t transparent, it doesn’t report to Congress, and it’s unclear what they do at all,” said John Lindsay-Poland, a researcher for Global Exchange, an international human rights group.\n“We anticipate there will be even less oversight by Commerce now than there was by State,” he said. “It was already problematic, and now all the indicators are that the gates will open and there won’t be any controls on who gets weapons that are legally exported.”\nDemocrats and human rights groups have warned that the rule changes could worsen gun violence problems in foreign countries, particularly in Mexico and other Latin American nations.\nThe proposed rule change, slated to go into effect no less than a month after a public comment ends in July, would be “extremely hazardous to global security,” Cardin said in a statement.\n“Small arms and light weapons are among the most lethal weapons that we and other countries export because these are the weapons that are most likely to be used to commit atrocities and suppress human rights, either by individuals, non-state groups, or governmental security and paramilitary forces,” Cardin said.\nHouse Democrats have introduced legislation to block transferring the arms export oversight to Commerce, but it’s unlikely to advance in the Republican-controlled Congress.\xa0\n\nOn this one fundamental human concern, the thing that matters most to us, our physical safety, and the physical safety of our loved ones, we don’t lead.\nSen. Chris Murphy\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, more than 73,000 U.S.-made guns were seized in Mexico, and 70 percent of guns used in Mexican homicides in 2017 were manufactured in the U.S., according to the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control. In past years, more than 90 percent of guns seized in the Bahamas and roughly 80 percent of firearms seized in Jamaica are made in the U.S. And in Brazil, police have reported finding an escalating number of American-made rifles in crimes and shootouts between rival drug gangs.\nMany of those guns are illegally smuggled into Latin America. But firearms also reach criminal factions thanks to legal exports and sales to police: in Mexico, more than 20,000 firearms, many of them American-made, have been lost by or stolen from police since 2006, Lindsay-Poland said.\n“All of the evidence and experience with gun violence in Latin America indicates that there will be more blood from U.S.-sourced weapons” thanks to the rule change, Lindsay-Poland said.\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a gun control advocate who opposes\xa0the proposed rule change, said this week that the U.S. could be on the verge of “exporting” its epidemic of gun violence to other nations.\n“We created the modern open economy, we created participatory democracy, we created the internet age, but on this one fundamental human concern, the thing that matters most to us, our physical safety, and the physical safety of our loved ones, we don’t lead,” Murphy said at a forum on the arms trade. “In fact, we do the very opposite. The United States runs at the very back of the pack.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Ex-CIA Chief Says Trump Will ‘Throw Anything At The Wall’ To Hurt Mueller Probe',
  'body': '\nGeorge W. Bush’s CIA chief Michael Hayden dismissed Donald Trump’s “spygate” narrative regarding the Russian collusion investigation Sunday, accusing the president of grasping at anything to undermine the probe.\nThe investigation activity described so far is “stunningly normal,” Hayden said on ABC’s “This Week.” From “everything I know, everyone has handled this just about the way it should have been handled,” he added.\nThe president is “simply trying to delegitimize the Mueller investigation … and he’s willing to throw almost anything against the wall” to do that, Hayden said. He pointed out that a previous Trump claim against investigators — that Trump Tower was wiretapped at Obama’s request — turned out to be absolutely untrue.\nTrump has insisted that the FBI embedded a “spy” in his presidential campaign team at the behest of Barack Obama. In fact, in standard procedure, an informant contacted two members of Trump’s campaign to investigate legitimate suspicions that members may have been compromised by Russian spies,\xa0The New York Times reported.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also said on “This Week” that he has seen no information suggesting anything problematic about actions by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. “What I have seen is evidence that they were investigating individuals with a history of links to Russia that were concerning,” said Rubio.\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump’s strategy has been to “spread a completely fallacious story” and then call for an investigation. He said the broader issue is “how do you counter a president who repeats falsehood after falsehood after falsehood and has the bully pulpit of the presidency to do it, and who has allies in Congress who are willing to support that?” His answer? “Throw the bums out.”\nIt begins by seeding the ground with a falsehood: “They spied on the Trump campaign.” It’s then promoted by the President, who echoes the falsehood. Then his allies call to investigate the falsehood.This is how propaganda works. It is also how democracy dies, one lie at a time.— Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) May 27, 2018\n\n\nHayden said he is convinced the Russians “affected” the presidential election. But “how much they affected it, is not just unknown, it is also unknowable,” he added.\nHayden also discussed his concerns about possible upcoming U.S. talks with North Korea, saying he was fearful that the president hasn’t done his “homework.” Hayden said he knows that one of the men in the talks will be “very, very prepared” — Kim Jong Un.\n“These folks are not going to get rid of all their nuclear weapons and if President Trump’s brand — and that’s the right word here — going into this meeting demands something like that, this is going to end up in a very bad place,” Hayden said. The “realistic expectation” at such a summit is to begin to “stabilize the Korean problem, not solve it,” he added.\nCheck out the rest of the interview above. Hayden talks about the Mueller investigation beginning at 6:11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': '6 Sandy Hook Families, FBI Agent Sue Alex Jones For Defamation',
  'body': '\nAlex Jones may start to learn that his actions as the conspiracy-minded host of Infowars have consequences.\xa0\nFamily members of six victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, filed a defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against Jones, who for years has peddled the false conspiracy theory that the massacre never happened. FBI agent William Aldenburg, who was among those responding to the shooting in which 26 people were killed, joined the suit, which was obtained by HuffPost.\nThe suit also names Jones’ Infowars contributor Wolfgang Halbig and Halbig’s associate, Cory Sklanka. It was filed by attorney Josh Koskoff of the Bridgeport, Connecticut-based law firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder.\xa0\nPart of Jones’ false narrative has been that interviews of Sandy Hook parents conducted by CNN were fake.\n\n“Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in a 2014 Infowars broadcast. “He’s not there in the town square. We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people ... covering up everything.”\nThe suit lists numerous videos made by Jones and articles he has written, including one story published just after the shooting titled “FATHER OF SANDY HOOK VICTIM ASKS ‘READ THE CARD?’ SECONDS BEFORE TEAR-JERKING PRESS CONFERENCE.” The story had a video attached to it titled “Sandy Hook Shooting Exposed As a Fraud.”\nIn a May 2014 broadcast, Jones asserted that former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg knew about the shooting before it happened. This, of course, is a lie.\n“The whole thing, you’ve got ’em jumping the gun ... that Bloomberg was saying get ready the day before, get ready to fundraise on mass shootings ... had a false start, didn’t you Bloomy?” Jones said in a broadcasted conversation with Halbig, according to the suit.\nJones’ sidekick, Halbig, has called the Sandy Hook victims “crisis actors” and has also questioned whether the Pulse nightclub and Parkland mass shootings in Florida took place, according to Koskoff.\nHalbig, a 70-year-old former police officer and school administrator, harassed the victims and made more than 22 trips from his home in Florida to Connecticut to deliver “highly controversial testimony” to the Newtown Board of Education, the suit said. His many visits led police to warn that he would be charged with harassment unless he stopped contacting residents, according to the suit.\nIn a 2015 Facebook post, Halbig floated a false claim that a father of a Sandy Hook victim and Aldenberg were the same person. He’s called the shooting a “scam” and “the biggest illusion ever portrayed by Homeland Security and FEMA,” the new suit says.\nThe suit joins a long list of others filed against Jones this year. The parents of two Sandy Hook children filed one\xa0in April alleging they have been harassed by conspiracy theorists because of Jones. Earlier that same month, Jones was hit with a defamation lawsuit for misidentifying the Parkland school shooter.\xa0And in March, he was hit with a defamation suit for promoting a conspiracy about a witness to the Charlottesville, Virginia, Unite the Right rally last year in which counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed by an alleged white supremacist.\n\nKoskoff said in a statement that Jones “saw an opportunity” to profit off the Sandy Hook tragedy.\n“He went on a sustained attack that has lasted for years, accusing shattered family members of being actors, stating as fact that the shooting itself was a hoax and inciting others to act on these malicious lies,” Koskoff said. “He knew his claims were false but he made them anyway to further a simple but pathetic goal: to make money by tearing away at the families’ pain. This lawsuit seeks to hold Alex Jones and his financial network accountable for those disgraceful actions.”\nThis story has been updated with details from the lawsuit.\n 6 Sandy Hook Families, FBI Agent Sue Alex Jones For Defamation by sebastian on Scribd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― Fox News viewers aren’t too keen on Robert Mueller, the longtime Republican law enforcement official now heading the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nOf those Americans who say at least some of their information on the FBI’s investigation came from Fox News, 65 percent strongly disapproved of Mueller, while another 9 percent somewhat disapproved, a newly released HuffPost/YouGov survey finds. \nMueller got higher approval from those watching other networks, with 60 percent of those following the investigation on CNN saying they strongly approved and 70 percent of those getting news from MSNBC giving the special counsel strong approval.\xa0Some people followed the story on multiple networks.\nMost Fox News viewers ― 68 percent ― also thought that the FBI was biased against President Donald Trump, while 61 percent either had little or no trust in the FBI. (The kind of people who turn to Fox News, of course, are also probably likely to be the most suspicious of the probe to begin with: About half of the Trump voters who’ve been following the story say they’ve tuned into Fox.) More than three-quarters of Americans say they’ve heard at least something in the news lately about Mueller and the FBI’s Russia investigation ― and among that group, nearly half said at least some of their news came from cable TV. \nFox News hosts like Sean Hannity have been heavily criticizing the special counsel investigation along with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who named Mueller as special counsel and is also a Republican. Mueller is a decorated veteran who joined the Justice Department under George H.W. Bush and was nominated as FBI director by George W. Bush.\nOverall, the HuffPost/YouGov survey found that Americans are largely split on the FBI’s handling of the Russia investigation, with 37 percent approving, 36 percent disapproving, and the rest unsure. Mueller gets only modestly more positive marks: 38 percent approve of his performance as special counsel, while 32 percent disapprove. Just under half of respondents say they have at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, down significantly from 2015, although relatively unchanged from polls taken earlier this year.\nAs in previous surveys, views are deeply polarized. About three-quarters of Hillary Clinton voters, but only a third of Trump voters, say they have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI. A 73 percent majority of Trump voters, but just 7 percent of Clinton voters, think the agency is biased against the president.\nA previous HuffPost/YouGov poll showed that Trump had successfully convinced most of his voters that the FBI was biased against him.\nOn Sunday, Trump called for an investigation into whether the FBI infiltrated his campaign by having an informant interview three associates of the campaign. Over the weekend, he also called on “real Americans” to “start getting tough” on the investigation he called a “scam.”\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\n\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 10-12 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

 {'title': 'We Asked The American Public To Settle 5 Of The Internet’s Dumbest Debates',
  'body': "\nSurvey research allows us to get a sense of how the nation as a whole feels about current events, rather than trying to draw inferences from the people we know, or from the groups stating their opinions the most loudly.\xa0Sometimes, if we’re lucky, it also allows us to get a scientifically valid perspective on whatever people are yelling about on the internet.\nThis week, that would be whether the voice in a random sound bite is saying the name “Yanny” or “Laurel.”\nIt’s actually “Laurel.”\nThe U.S., however, is a country where most voters don’t believe people can agree on basic facts. And when we asked 1,000 Americans to listen to the audio as part of a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, the responses showed little signs of consensus: 35 percent said “Yanny,” 31 percent said “Laurel,” and 14 percent didn’t hear either. The rest weren’t sure.\nThe poll seemingly supports the theory that age may play a role in the differing perceptions, with younger people more attuned to the higher-frequency sounds ― and more likely to fall into the “Yanny” camp. Americans under age 30 were Team Yanny by an 18-point margin, compared to just an 8-point margin for those aged 30-44. Americans aged 45-64 and those 65 or older were Team Laurel by a 2-point margin and a 5-point margin, respectively.\n\n\n\nWhile we were at it, we asked our respondents to weigh in on four more pressing internet controversies (no, not The Dress ... we already did that one). And while most political polling demonstrates just how polarized the country is along partisan lines, the results of this survey suggest there are also some major generational fault lines in our assumptions on everything from the meaning of internet acronyms to how we classify our food.\nDoes the “H” in “IMHO” stand for “honest” or “humble”? \nBuzzFeed touched off an internet firestorm when they asked earlier this month. Once again, we’re a nation divided: 29 percent say “humble,” 32 percent say “honest,” and the rest say it’s neither or that they’re not sure. And once again, there’s a notable generational divide, with younger Americans far more likely to think it’s “honest.” There’s also an educational gap, with college grads saying by an 18-point margin that it’s “humble,” and those without a degree saying by an 11-point margin that it’s “honest.” (Side note: BuzzFeed’s reader poll found “honest” winning by a significant margin. That makes sense, since the site probably has disproportionately younger readers. It’s also a good reminder that reader polls ― the kind that allow anyone browsing a website to answer, and don’t keep track of the demographics of the people responding, or use weighting to make sure they match the composition of the nation as a whole ― aren’t a representative gauge of anything beyond the opinions of the people who click on them.)\n\n\n\nIs a hot dog a sandwich? \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Hot Dog and Sausage Council has weighed in. So have Stephen Colbert and John Hodgman. Here’s the court of public opinion: a 53 percent majority say no, with just 35 percent believing that it is, and the remaining 12 percent having better things to do with their lives.\nResults are impressively consistent along a number of demographic lines. A roughly equivalent 56 percent of Democrats, 53 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of independents agree on a hot dog’s lack of sandwich status. There’s no sign of an education, racial or gender gap either.\nAge, however, once again comes into play. Americans under age 45 overwhelmingly contest the hot dog’s claim to sandwichness. Their older compatriots are closer to evenly split. There’s also a regional divide, with Midwesterners most amenable to Team Sandwich, and Northeasterners by far the least so.\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nOne or two spaces after a period?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is another perennial debate to flare up this month, thanks to an article in The Washington Post. By a 11-point margin, 47 percent to 36 percent, Americans prefer one space. \nAmericans under 30 are overwhelmingly Team One Space, while those over 65 are closely divided. There’s also an educational divide, with those who hold college degrees preferring two spaces, and those without favoring just one.\n\n\n\nHow do you pronounce “GIF”? \nThe creator of the GIF says it’s with a soft “G,” like “giraffe.” But he’s outnumbered: 63 percent of the American public disagrees, preferring the hard “G,” as in “gift.” Not a single demographic group examined in the survey, regardless of age, education or anything else, prefers the soft “G.”\xa0\n\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nGlad that’s all settled!\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 15-16 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Scottish Golf Resort Pays Women Significantly Less Than Men: Report',
  'body': '\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump’s flagship Scottish golf resort in Turnberry pays its female employees less than men and has four times as many men as women in executive spots, according to an official filing with local authorities, The Scotsman reported.\nThe mean rate for female pay at Trump Turnberry is 13.7 percent less than the pay for men, according to gender pay equality documents required by Scotland. So for every $1 men were paid, women got 86 cents.\nThe average mean bonus paid to men was $4,414, which was nearly twice as much as the average bonus paid to women — $2,256 — in the 12 months to April 2017,\xa0the newspaper reported, citing the filings. Only seven women and 11 men were given bonuses.\nTurnberry management flatly attributed the pay gap to “male-dominated functions” at golf resorts, as well as the ”number of senior leadership roles undertaken by males” at Turnberry.\nThe widest gender gap was to be found in the bonus culture at the 800 acre resort. The average median bonus paid to men is £2,506, but the sum drops to just £1,116 among women, a shortfall of 53.5 per cent. The average mean bonus paid to men is £3,317, which drops 48.9 per cent for female employees, who receive £1,695. While seven women received bonus in the 12 months to April 2017, the number jumped to 11 for men.Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/trump-turnberry-paying-women-employees-less-than-men-1-4741767\nWomen fill 46.8 percent of the lowest paid jobs at the 800-acre resort, and just 31.2 percent of the highest paid positions, report added.\nThe discrepancy emerged in what’s believed to be the first time pay rates and executive numbers have been revealed by any Trump business. Trump has owned the resort since 2014, and it’s run by his sons Eric and Donald Jr.\nPatrick Harvie, a member of the Scottish Parliament from the Green Party, told The Scotsman: “Trump is a sexist bully, so the fact that equal pay doesn’t seem to matter at his golf course should surprise no one.”\nThe U.K. Equality Pay Act requires any company with more than 250 employees (Turnberry has 313) to file annual reports detailing gender pay rates.\nWhen Trump was running for president he insisted he had been “very, very good for women” and “way ahead of the curve” as an employer. His attorney Michael Cohen boasted that there were more female executives at the Trump Organization than men, but did not provide any evidence to substantiate that claim.\nHelping working women has been a major talking point for Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, but she supported her dad’s move last year to dismantle the Obama-era initiative bolstering equal pay. Similar to the requirement in the U.K., the initiative would have required private employers with 100 or more workers to submit pay data.\nEarlier this month, The Scotsman reported that the U.S. government paid $7,800 to the golf resort to cover expenses and security for unnamed VIP guests earlier this year.\nThe resort last year got a $147,000 tax break from Scottish taxpayers. But the government has since jettisoned the property from the program that was intended to give struggling companies a break, the Sunday Herald reported.\n“It’s bad enough that he has a business presence in Scotland,” Harvie told the newspaper after the decision was made. “It’s galling to learn that the public purse is giving him a helping hand.”\n“This feeds the misconception that having men in high-paid jobs and women in low-paid jobs is an inevitable outcome.”Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/trump-turnberry-paying-women-employees-less-than-men-1-4741767\nMarch, shows that the mean gender pay gap for female employees is 13.69 per cent lower than the male equivalent, meaning they earn 86 pence for every £1 that their male colleagues earn. Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/trump-turnberry-paying-women-employees-less-than-men-1-4741767\nTurnberry, one of Mr Trump’s most prestigious overseas properties, blamed the “male dominated functions” associated with golf clubs for the shortfall in female leaders and the wide bonus gap, which means women receive nearly £1,400 less than their male counterparts. Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/trump-turnberry-paying-women-employees-less-than-men-1-4741767\nThere are four times as many men as women occupying executive positions at the US president’s Trump Turnberry company. Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/trump-turnberry-paying-women-employees-less-than-men-1-474176\nLast year, his administration rolled back an Obama-era policy aimed at eliminating the gender pay gap. The ruling, which would have compelled large firms to report breakdowns to the US government of what they pay employees by race and gender, was denounced by the Trump administration as “enormously burdensome.” An analysis of Mr Trump’s hiring policies by The Atlantic magazine in March claimed his White House has named twice as many men as women to appointed positions.Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/trump-turnberry-paying-women-employees-less-than-men-1-4741767\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'The Latest School Shooting Hasn’t Really Stirred The Gun Debate',
  'body': '\nLast week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed 10 students and teachers isn’t significantly reviving the momentum for gun control that followed the February massacre in Parkland, Florida,\xa0new HuffPost/YouGov polling suggests.\n\xa0Slightly more than half of the public now calls gun violence a very serious problem, down from 60 percent in February. A 56-percent majority say it’s possible to pass new gun laws without violating the Second Amendment, down from a high of 65 percent. And, regardless of how they personally feel about the subject, just 40 percent now think passing new gun laws is politically possible, down from 50 percent.\n\n\n\n\nHuffPost\n\n\n\nConcern about gun violence and a desire for Congress to take action are now several percentage points higher than they were in April, when most of the post-Parkland wave had already abated,\xa0but it’s difficult to say how much of that represents a genuine uptick, rather than the variability\xa0inherent in tracking polls.\xa0Either way, it’s clear that the energy around crafting new gun policies isn’t near the heights reached earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\nHuffPost\n\n\n\nSimilarly, tracking data from the progressive pollster Civiqs showed voters’ support for gun control spiking after Parkland, but then slowly declining. Santa Fe, it found, at most seemed to modestly stanch that decline.\n\nGoogle Trends, which tracks how often people query the search engine on varying topics,\xa0shows that comparatively little attention has been paid to gun issues following the lastest school shooting.\xa0\n  trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"Parkland shooting","geo":"US","time":"2018-01-01 2018-05-23"},{"keyword":"Santa Fe shooting","geo":"US","time":"2018-01-01 2018-05-23"},{"keyword":"Gun control","geo":"US","time":"2018-01-01 2018-05-23"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2018-01-01%202018-05-23&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Parkland%20shooting,Santa%20Fe%20shooting,Gun%20control","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); \nThe difference in public opinion following the two school shootings isn’t entirely surprising: It mirrors the difference in how each community responded.\xa0Although Americans were shocked by the Parkland massacre, the shift in public opinion it produced didn’t gain steam until the weeks that followed, when the surviving students spearheaded a gun control push. Their advocacy kept the debate over gun laws in the news, even after the immediate details of the shooting had faded.\nAlthough student activists nationwide led walkouts earlier this year in protest of gun violence, polling of teens finds that such attitudes aren’t universal among their generation.\xa0In largely rural Santa Fe,\xa0last week’s shooting didn’t spark the same kind of push for gun control. There were no local protests, and little talk of guns,the Los Angeles Times reported.\n“I don’t think guns are the problem — I think people are the problem,” a 16-year-old Santa Fe high school student\xa0told NBC. “Even if we did more gun laws, people who are sick enough to do something like this are still going to figure out a way to do it. So it doesn’t matter.”\nGun restrictions proposed in the wake of the Parkland shooting, meanwhile, remain broadly popular, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Americans, 78 percent to 11 percent, say that they favor strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns. They also say, 64 percent to 22 percent, that they favor raising the age for gun purchases to 21.\xa0\nA plurality, 43 percent, say President Donald Trump is not doing enough to pass gun laws, while just 6 percent believe he’s done too much.\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\n\n\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 18 to May 21 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.\xa0You can learn more\xa0about this project and\xa0take part\xa0in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

 {'title': 'GOP Sen. Jeff Flake: Trump’s ‘Spygate’ Is A ‘Diversion Tactic’',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, who has not ruled out running against Donald Trump for the White House, on Sunday criticized as a “diversion tactic” the president’s unsubstantiated allegation last week of an FBI “spy” being planted in his election campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nFlake’s comments, on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” put him again at the forefront of very few Republican lawmakers willing to openly challenge Trump over his attacks on law enforcement officials who are investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign.\nThe investigation was begun by the FBI in July 2016, but handed over by the Justice Department to Special Counsel Robert Mueller in May 2017 after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.\nFlake said Trump’s unfounded allegations about FBI spying on his campaign, which the president has called “Spygate,” came amid escalating, behind-the-scenes concern in the U.S. Senate that the president may try to stop the probe by firing Mueller or the person who appointed him, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n“The president had this diversion tactic, obviously, with so-called Spygate,” Flake said of Trump’s assertions last week. “There is concern that the president is laying the groundwork to move on Bob Mueller or Rosenstein. If that were to happen, obviously, that would cause a constitutional crisis.”\nSome senior Republicans, including Flake, have sounded similar warnings in recent weeks as the Mueller investigation has plowed forward, drawing frequent denunciations from Trump.\nMueller is also investigating any possible obstruction of justice by Trump. Trump and the White House have repeatedly denied any collusion by the campaign, or any other wrongdoing.\nThe White House has also said it is not considering firing Mueller.\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump called the investigation a “phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt” - reiterating his oft-stated resentment at the probe that has clouded his presidency.\nAfter Trump demanded an inquiry into his “spy” claim, the current FBI Director Christopher Wray and Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s probe, held two classified briefings on Thursday for senior lawmakers of both parties on the matter.\nDemocratic Representative Adam Schiff was among those briefed. Speaking on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, he said, “There is no evidence to support that spy theory. This is just a piece of propaganda the president wants to put out and repeat.”\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio told the same program that so far he has seen no evidence to support the president’s assertions about a campaign “spy.”\n“What I have seen so far is an FBI effort to learn more about individuals with a history of bragging about links to Russia that pre-exist the campaign. If those people were operating near my office or my campaign, I’d want them investigated,” said Rubio, who ran unsuccessfully against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary campaign.\n“If it turns out to be something different, we want to know about it. But it is the FBI’s job to investigate counterintelligence,” Rubio said.\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to meddle in the U.S. election campaign, included seeking to help Trump win. Moscow has denied the charge.\nFlake delivered a blistering attack on the president when he announced last October he would not run this year for re-election to the Senate. Asked if would run for the White House in 2020, he said: “It’s not in my plans, but I’ve not ruled anything out. I do hope that somebody runs on the Republican side other than the president, if nothing else simply to remind Republicans what conservatism is and what Republicans have traditionally stood for.” (Reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh Editing by Frances Kerry)\n',

  'body': '\nSTERLING, Va. ― Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager from California, wants to Make America Progressive Again.\nAnd more than any other Democratic donor, he’s putting his money where his mouth is. The billionaire has sunk over $32 million into his political nonprofit NextGen America’s efforts to turn out millennial voters in 10 battleground states this year.\nMore controversially, Steyer has spent another $40 million on a “Need to Impeach” initiative, using television ads to drum up signatures for a petition to oust President Donald Trump.\nIn an interview with Steyer this week, HuffPost asked him about the effectiveness of a campaign centered on the president, rather than policy issues; his views on the violence in Gaza; whether he plans to run for president; and whether his extraordinary wealth undermines his credibility as a progressive leader.\nWhy are you trying to mobilize millennials?\nIt’s the biggest age cohort in America and it votes at half the overall rate of American citizens. It seems to me a critical thing for the country that people who are knowledgeable and passionate and feel like the system doesn’t respond to them participate in elections. They also happen to be the most diverse generation in American history, and they’re probably the most progressive Americans.\nMillennial support for Democrats, according to a Reuters poll, has dropped off by 9 points since 2016. Is it possible that an effort to mobilize these voters could actually help Republicans?\nWell, I can tell you that our experience of going and doing more grassroots organizing for people under the age of 35 doesn’t suggest that. And I saw that poll as well, so it’ll be whatever it is.\nBut we believe that the broadest democracy is the best democracy, and overlooked groups are not gonna have their interests and rights respected unless they participate.\n\nYour Mother’s Day ad\xa0― in which a regretful mom warned others to “talk to your child about the GOP” ― made some waves. Was it supposed to be satirical?\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it was supposed to be funny. Did you laugh?\nYeah, I thought it was kind of funny. But isn’t the ad a case of preaching to the choir? The people who find it funny are probably already voting for Democrats.\nOK, but then, I would ask you this: If you look at 2014 and 2016 and 2010, all the national elections in the last decade that have not included the words “Barack Obama,” how’s the Democratic turnout been?\nIs this about the base then?\nIt’s about turnout, yes. If you look at why pollsters have blown every election for the last two years, it’s because they can’t model the electorate. They know how Daniel’s gonna vote; they just don’t know if he’s gonna vote. \nThere’s polling data that says your “Need to Impeach” campaign is a political loser. Won’t it just drive Republicans out to the polls?\nFirst of all, you have to start with the point that we actually have a reckless, lawless and dangerous president, that we actually think he should be impeached, that in every single one of the instances that you’re talking about, he has more influence on it than anyone else in the United States of America ― in a malign way. \nSo whether they like it or not, this [midterm election] is largely a referendum on this administration.\nWhat is your answer to the tactical argument against it? Because you don’t get to impeach Trump without a majority in the House. The last time impeachment was in the air in 1998, it was a midterm election for a second-term Democratic president and Democrats still ended up gaining seats in part because of public fatigue with the impeachment process.\nI think this is really different from 1998, and I bet you do too. There you had a president who was being impeached for a lie about a personal affair. Here we have a president who really is degrading our Constitution on a daily basis and breaking the law on important things. \nSo what the Democrats are saying is, “We don’t want to talk about it because we’re worried that tactically, politically, in six months, our polls tell us it won’t work well”?\xa0It’s six months from now. You have no idea. The pollsters have missed every single election [in the past two years]. \nWe think this is a maelstrom, so we’re gonna go to our go-to move. Our go-to move is: Tell the truth and put the American people first.\nAnybody who thinks that they know what it’s gonna be like on Nov. 6, 2018, is kidding themselves. The world just changed today. We don’t know what’s gonna happen in the Gaza Strip. I don’t. Do you? Do I think it’s a big deal? I do actually. \xa0\n\nWasn’t the 2016 election already a referendum on Trump? Hillary Clinton banked on the idea that he was so repulsive, voters would reject him.\nWell, that’s actually an interesting point. I would say that midterm elections are overwhelmingly referendums on a sitting administration. The energy Democrats are counting on is not a positive reflection of the great program they’re putting forward, but is a reflection of people’s distaste for this president.\nI don’t know what you think the Women’s March was about. I sort of think it was about people who were really upset about this president. Every single one of these Indivisible groups is really a reaction to this election. I don’t think that they’re sitting here saying, “What we’re really organizing around is the Democratic platform.”\xa0Do you?\nI do, to be honest with you.\nEvery single issue\xa0[Democratic voters care about goes back to Trump].\xa0Is health care a gigantic issue in America? Absolutely. Is Trump on the wrong side of it? 100 percent. Is he on the wrong side of every issue as regards the American people? I think he is actually.\nOne issue you seem passionate about is the Israeli government’s killing of protesters in Gaza this week. Why do you think it was a pivotal moment?\nOur foreign policy is changing from being a relationship-based partnership policy around the world to a military policy. Here’s a perfect example where we believe that the United States and its allies have the right to dictate what’s supposed to happen ― whether that’s our relationship with climate policy, NAFTA, Iran, China, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nDoes it surprise that now we’re in a proxy war in Syria and now in the Gaza Strip where we’re using force to insist that we’re right? It doesn’t surprise me. Because the implication of our foreign policy is: We will do what we want. And we will dictate outcomes to everybody else in the world.\nWhat do you mean by proxy war?\nWhen you look at what happened, we pulled out of the Iran [nuclear] treaty, and that causes an opening for missiles trading back and forth in Syria between Iran and Israel. And we moved our embassy to Jerusalem, and that caused protests in Gaza, which were put down with extreme force.\nAnd so I think that if you look at all the different instances I gave you, America is stating that we represent only ourselves and we will use our might to ensure we get our way. That’s a real change in terms of what we said we are in the world, where we’d been trying to be an example of democracy and liberty.\nBillions of people have a screen and they’re looking at what’s going on and they’re drawing their own conclusions about who we are.\nWhat should we do about Israel? Leverage American aid to change their behavior?\nPeople are always talking about what we should do. In most instances, in foreign economics, there’s not one thing you should do. The question is what role you’re gonna play and what are the principles under which you’re going to play it.\nBut one of the questions we need to ask is: Are we gonna be a country that is trying to live up to its ideals? Or are we a country that insists on its way and uses military might to make sure we get it?\n\n\n\n\nTommaso Boddi/Getty Images\n\n\nSteyer rarely gets involved in Democratic primaries, but he has endorsed California state Sen. Kevin de Leon (left), who is challenging\xa0Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).\n\n\n\nWith “Need to Impeach,” you’ve built an email list of over 5 million people. Are you going to run for president?\nI have no idea what I’m gonna do after Nov. 6, and there’s no way to know.\nThe funny thing about this is, you’re asking me and people are always asking me, “What is your subtext? Because you couldn’t really think that this unfit president is unfit, that this lawless president is actually lawless.”\nNo, the subtext is: This guy’s dangerous.\nThere are bright candidates exciting the grassroots and they’re sometimes fighting to get a fair shake with Democratic Party leadership because they don’t have a dollar to their names. Why not back progressives in primary races?\nWe are going to be asked to do a thousand things this year. If we do a thousand things, we are going to do zero well.\nWe are the largest organizer of young people in the United States. We are knocking on millions of doors with the unions. We are trying to oppose this president as hard as we can with this impeachment campaign. And we are running up to three statewide [ballot initiatives] on clean energy.\nSo it’s not like we’re doing nothing. I challenge you to find somebody who is doing as much.\nWe have made the choice that if people are within the range of Democratic reason, we are going to give as much information to the voters and let them decide.\nHaving said that, we understand that there is an intellectual combat going on within the Democratic Party. To use a simplistic term that I don’t really agree with, it’s kind of Hillary vs. Bernie, mods and progressives.\nThat’s a fairly accurate framing.\nIt ain’t really though. The real way to think about it is: Are we talking about incremental thinking or visionary thinking?\nAnd the second is about corruption. If you’re taking $385,000 for a one-hour speech to Goldman Sachs, really that didn’t change anything for you? Because I think most people in America thought, “If I got $385,000, it might change something for me.” If someone gave me $385,000 and said, “I’d like you to have a meeting,” I’d say, “OK!”\nPeople get that. There’s a big question about the fact that our system is corrupt and rigged. And that’s something that Democrats are inchoately dealing with. Like, that just feels wrong!\nMy father was a lawyer, and one of the first things he told me about being a citizen was that “But everybody else does it, your honor,” is not a defense at law.\nIn that divide though, however you want to frame it, where do you place yourself?\nProgressive.\nSome people might say, “This guy is fabulously wealthy. How can he ever really get the depths of economic inequality and what it’s like to struggle?”\nI’m sure people may think that. I do this for 100 percent of my time and try to make sure I speak to American voters as much as possible, and that’s the most fun I have.\nSo every single week, I am out talking to people who are not fabulously wealthy. In fact, I very rarely talk to people who are fabulously wealthy. What I try to do as much as possible is go and make sure that I’m talking to activists and regular citizens, so that I,\xa0in fact, do understand.\nOne of the real issues here is raising money and whether you have to spend all your time talking to people who are somewhere between rich and fabulously rich because they can afford to give thousands to your campaign.\nAnd you don’t have to do that.\nI don’t! I consider it a privilege and a luxury that I get to talk to normal people. I get to talk to normal Americans all the time and it is incredibly fun.\nGoldman Sachs hasn’t offered me $385,000 and I don’t know what I’d do if they ever did. But I don’t need it. I can be as honest as I can be.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n',

  'body': '\nMissouri Gov. Eric Greitens resigned Tuesday, shortly after a judge ordered him to turn over documents\xa0to the Missouri House committee currently investigating campaign finance allegations against the governor.\nCole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem on Tuesday ordered Greitens’ nonprofit, A New Missouri Inc., to turn over documents and communications in an investigation into whether the organization coordinated with the governor and his campaign committee.\n“The last few months have been incredibly difficult for me, for my family, for my team, for my friends and for many many people that I love,” Greitens said at a press conference announcing the resignation. “This ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family, millions of dollars in mounting legal bills, [and] endless mounting attacks designed to cause maximum damage to family and friends.”\n“I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment,” Greitens insisted.\nIn a statement following Greitens’ announcement, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said she had “reached a fair and just resolution of the pending charges” with the governor’s defense team, and would announce further details\xa0on Wednesday.\xa0\nJUST SENT TO INBOX: @stlcao says she has reached a “fair and just resolution” in pending case against @EricGreitens. Will announce tomorrow @41actionnews pic.twitter.com/xEIiZb5Hso— Ariel Rothfield KSHB (@arothfield) May 29, 2018\n\n\nGreitens’ announcement Tuesday,\xa0which becomes effective on June 1 at 5 p.m., comes just weeks after the release of a detailed legislative report in which his former mistress accused him of coercing her into sex and slapping her.\nThe Republican governor had for weeks pledged to remain in office despite those allegations, defying bipartisan calls for him to resign and saying that he was the target of a “political witch hunt.”\xa0\nThe report was released on April 11 by a special investigative committee of the Republican-controlled Missouri House, evidence that Greitens’ relationship with his own party had frayed amid the scandal surrounding the affair. It included the anonymous testimony of his former hairdresser, who said their encounters were not always consensual and that at times Greitens spanked, grabbed her and called her profane names during sex.\nJust before the release of the report, Greitens said the relationship, which went on for several months,\xa0was entirely consensual and that the allegations, given under oath, were “tabloid trash” and “gossip.”\n“The accusations published in the House Committee’s report will be directly contradicted by the facts that emerge in court,” Greitens said in a statement after the release. “A court of law and a jury of my peers will let every person in Missouri know the truth and prove my innocence.”\nGreitens, who is married and has two children, had faced the prospect of a criminal trial after being\xa0indicted on a charge of felony invasion of privacy. He was accused of taking photos of his mistress without her consent and then using the images to threaten her.\nThe felony charge was later dropped due to the possibility that the prosecutor could be called as a witness herself. But Greitens still faces a second felony charge for computer data tampering, after allegedly using his nonprofit to obtain a fundraising list for use by his campaign.\nDespite his denials, the report prompted members of his own party to call for his resignation, and The New York Times noted that many have worried the ongoing coverage of the scandal could hurt the party’s chances during the midterm elections.\nDemocrats had urged fellow lawmakers to launch impeachment proceedings against Greitens were he to remain in office. Even the state’s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, said such conduct was “certainly impeachable.”\n“The people of Missouri should not be put through that ordeal,” Hawley, who is running for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill, said at the time. “Governor Greitens should resign immediately.”\nThis article has been updated to include a statement from St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

It was headlined: “When You’re Feeling Low, Just Remember I’ll Be Dead In About 15 Or 20 Years.”\nThe Onion finally shared Cohen’s response in a hilarious takedown on Monday.\n“Let me begin by stating the obvious … that the commentary was not written by Mr. Trump,” Cohen wrote in the email dated Jan. 24, 2013. “Secondly, the article is an absolutely disgusting piece that lacks any place in journalism; even in your Onion.”\nCohen demanded immediate removal of this “disgraceful piece from your website and issue an apology to Mr. Trump ... This commentary goes way beyond defamation and, if not immediately removed, I will take all actions necessary to ensure your actions do not go without consequence.”\nThe big finish: “Guide yourself accordingly.”\nIn the spirit of transparency, here is Mr. Cohen’s letter, printed in full: https://t.co/uPnzZYUtyZ pic.twitter.com/HWAhxudr2d— The Onion (@TheOnion) May 21, 2018\n\n\nThe Onion said it’s ready to talk now.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheOnion/status/998619468430565377\nThere’s always the possibility that the email is itself an Onion parody.

  'body': '\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos provoked an outcry Tuesday when she said schools can choose to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement on potentially undocumented students.\n“I think that’s a school decision, it’s a local community decision,” DeVos told the House Education and the Workforce Committee. “I refer to the fact that we have laws and we also are compassionate. I urge this body to do its job and address and clarify where there is confusion around this.”\nDeVos was responding to a question from Rep.\xa0Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) about whether she thinks school leaders should call ICE on students or their parents.\nAdvocacy groups immediately protested her answer,\xa0pointing out that under the Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe, all children ― undocumented or not ― are entitled to a free public education. Some demanded that DeVos issue an immediate clarification in light of this fact.\nElizabeth Hill,\xa0press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, provided HuffPost with a clarification of DeVos’ remarks on Wednesday.\xa0“Her position is that schools must comply with Plyler and all other applicable and relevant law,” said Hill.\nDuring the hearing, DeVos did note that the 1982 Supreme Court decision requires public schools to educate all students, including those who are undocumented. Still, she repeatedly said it was a school’s decision if it wanted to call ICE on kids and their parents.\n\n\n\n\nLeah Millis / Reuters\n\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos likely just discouraged children from\xa0going to school.\n\n\n\nMALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, issued a statement saying that DeVos should resign for “abject incompetence” if she does not “issue an immediate clarification that emphasizes the holding in Plyler.” The organization also said it “stands ready to hold accountable through legal challenge anyone in public education who attempts to report a student to ICE.”\nDeVos’ comments could have a chilling impact on undocumented students attending schools, said Andrea Senteno, legislative staff attorney for MALDEF, on Wednesday. Indeed, around the country, schools have seen\xa0substantial drops in attendance\xa0after ICE raids at local businesses.\xa0\n“We are very concerned her statement yesterday leaves open to interpretation what the law actually is for schools and administrators and those in the community,” Senteno said. “There are going to be students and family members who are not going to know what that means.”\nThe Education Department needs to make publicly clear “what the current law is and what students’ rights are,” said Senteno.\xa0\nThe American Civil Liberties Union also blasted DeVos’ comments at the hearing.\n“Let’s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status. Secretary DeVos is once again wrong,” said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns for the ACLU, in a statement.\xa0\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of MALDEF legislative staff attorney Andrea Senteno.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Twice Introduced Anti-Abortion Bills Giving Men ‘Property Rights’ Over Fetuses',
  'body': '\nIn 1999, Scott Pruitt, then an Oklahoma state senator, introduced a bill to grant men “property rights” over unborn fetuses, requiring women to obtain the would-be father’s permission before aborting a pregnancy.\nPruitt, now the embattled administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, submitted the legislation again in 2005. \nThe bill, which did not pass either time, faded from Pruitt’s political legacy. But the legislation merits new examination as the EPA chief faces down an avalanche of corruption accusations. As HuffPost previously reported, Pruitt’s support from right-wing evangelical Christians, a group that largely opposes abortion, has\xa0helped him keep his job\xa0amid calls from droves of Democrats and a handful of Republicans to fire the administrator.\nAnd while his current role atop the EPA does not give him any official control over abortion policy, he has appeared alongside President Donald Trump in meetings with evangelical leaders, and his draconian history on the issue is of a piece with the administration.\xa0In one of Trump’s first acts after taking office, he\xa0reinstated\xa0and expanded the Reagan-era “global gag rule,” withholding federal funding from charities and aid organizations that counsel women on family planning options that include abortion. Last week, the White House proposed a new “domestic gag rule” that would strip Planned Parenthood of funding.\n“It’s not surprising that another member of Trump’s inner circle is hostile to women,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, a senior director at the progressive super PAC American Bridge, which opposes Pruitt and supports abortion rights. “But framing a fetus as a man’s property is a new low.”\nAmerican Bridge resurfaced the legislation and shared it with HuffPost.\xa0The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.\nPruitt has spent his 15 months at the EPA pushing to keep government out of the private sector. He’s sought to radically deregulate the fossil fuel and chemical industries, clear the way for companies to produce more asthma-triggering pollution, allow deadly chemicals to remain on the market, and revise restrictions on teenage workers handling dangerous pesticides.\n\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n\nTrump shakes Pruitt’s hand on June 28, 2017.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, the bill from his time as a state legislator stated that “it is the responsibility of the state to ensure that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” referring to a “fetus” as “property” that has been “jointly created by both father and mother.” \nThe legislation would have barred doctors from performing abortions without signed statements of permission from the father, or evidence that the man could not be located “after diligent effort.” If the pregnancy resulted from rape, the woman would be required to show “such assault has been reported to a law enforcement agency having the requisite jurisdiction.” \nDoctors who performed the procedure without that documentation would have risked losing their medical licenses, been “civilly liable to the father of the aborted child for any damages caused thereby,” and had to pay punitive fines of $5,000.\nIn a statement to The Associated Press in 1999, Pruitt said a pregnant woman who were to obtain an abortion without meeting the bill’s criteria would face legal consequences. “She’ll be held accountable for it,” Pruitt said.\nPruitt also sought to restrict abortion in other ways.\xa0In 2001,\xa0when the Legislature was considering a bill to require that pregnant minors show parental permission before obtaining an abortion, he introduced an amendment to define a “fetus” as “any individual human organism from fertilization until birth.” \n\nHe doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property.\nLeslie McGorman, NARAL Pro-Choice America\n\nThe timing of the bills came nearly a decade after the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in\xa0Planned Parenthood v. Casey, in which it ruled that provisions requiring a woman to obtain her husband’s permission for an abortion were unconstitutional.\n“He doesn’t agree with the court’s not viewing women as property and also doesn’t believe in the intellectual concept that women should have agency over their own reproductive choices,” said Leslie McGorman, deputy director at the advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Frankly there’s not a whole lot more to tell except that he is the guy who his record indicates he is.”\n“He carries that lack of concern for the greater good throughout all of the things he’s done in his career,” she added, referring to his rollback of environmental safeguards.\nUntil 2017, Pruitt served on the board of trustees at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, an institution that has said\xa0“a wife is to submit herself graciously” to her husband. Around the time he first introduced the abortion bill, in 1999, Pruitt served on the board of the MEND Medical Clinic and Pregnancy Resource Center. Its current executive director, Forrest Cowan, has said unwed mothers have been “failed” by a “boyfriend, who values his own selfish gratification over responsibility, and her father, who should have had her back.” \nPruitt’s crusade against abortion rights continued after he left the state Senate to become Oklahoma’s attorney general. When a district court found a law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion to be unconstitutional, Pruitt appealed the decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. After losing there, he unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.\nIn 2012, The Tulsa World excoriated Pruitt in an editorial for wasting “more taxpayer money … on this misguided effort to control doctor-patient interaction and the practice of medicine ― but only when women are concerned.” \n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Other Reason Trump Hasn’t Fired Scott Pruitt: His Evangelical Christian Ties\n\n\n\n\n\nEPA To Gut The Only Major Federal Rule To Cut Climate Pollution From Vehicles\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Pruitt’s First Year Set The EPA Back Anywhere From A Few Years To 3 Decades\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'ABC Knew Exactly What They Were Getting With Roseanne Barr',
  'body': "\nABC’s decision to cancel its “Roseanne” reboot after a\xa0racist tweet\xa0by the show’s lead star raised one immediate question on Tuesday:\xa0Uh, what took so long?\nDisney CEO\xa0Robert Iger\xa0stood behind the decision, first announced by ABC president Channing Dungey,\xa0saying, “There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.”\nBut if Roseanne Barr’s tweet disqualifies her from leading a major network’s primetime sitcom, then her yearslong history of outlandishly false, inflammatory claims should have barred her from getting her show back in the first place.\nHere are some of the problems ABC seemingly ignored when handing the 65-year-old a series.\n\n\nBarr previously called a black woman an “ape.”\nBarr’s tweet that sparked outrage and her show’s cancellation referred to former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, a black woman, as\xa0“Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.”\nIn her apology Tuesday, Barr said she “should have known better” when she made her racist tweet. And she’s right\xa0— because this was at least the second time she has called a black woman an “ape.”\nIn a since-deleted 2013 tweet, Barr called then-President Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice “a man with big swinging ape balls.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nBarr loves calling people Nazis.\xa0\nWhen Barr disagrees with someone, she has a habit of calling them Nazis. The same day as her racist remarks about Jarrett, she also tweeted that liberal billionaire George Soros was “a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered.”\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoros was 14 years old in 1945 ― younger than Anne Frank ― and was never a Nazi collaborator.\nIn March, Barr tweeted a photo of Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor David Hogg, accusing him of making a Nazi salute. Hogg was a survivor at Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed by a gunman.\nShe later walked back the statement,\xa0but the damage was done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, she called Hilary Clinton aide Huma Abedin “a filthy nazi whore.”\nAnd if you happen to disagree with her? Well, you might be a Nazi too, according to Barr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich is very interesting, considering ...\nBarr dressed up as Adolf Hitler.\nIn a 2009 article for the satirical Jewish magazine Heeb, Barr donned a Swatiska and Hitler mustache for a photo shoot which showed her taking gingerbread cookie figures out of an oven. The post was titled “That Oven Feelin’,” and the photos still exist all over the internet.\xa0\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n“Who better a symbol of Germany than Hitler?” Barr said when she finally addressed the issue in an episode of “The Green Room with Paul Provenza.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nShe later said she didn’t “give a fuck what people think” and that it “pissed me off” that people were upset by it.\nBarr peddles false conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom falsely claiming Hogg was giving a Nazi salute during a speech, to saying Democrats were running a child sex ring out of a neighborhood pizza shop in D.C., Barr has peddled wildly false and dangerous conspiracy theories to her ravenous followers.\nBarr has retweeted posts and links backing the “untold story”\xa0hoax that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex trafficking ring out of a pizza shop in the nation’s capital. She more recently peddled an incorrect conspiracy that President Donald Trump had “freed so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this word. Hundreds each month.”\nShe was apparently referring to nonsense theories posted on websites including 4Chan that suggested Trump is secretly dismantling satanic child sex rings linked to high-level Democrats.\nShe has also tweeted about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staffer fatally shot in Washington in 2016, claiming it was a political assassination. No evidence suggests that.\nApparently none of these lies set off any alarms for ABC.\nBarr is terrified of Muslims.\nIn her tweet about Jarrett, Barr said she was a baby born of the “Muslim brotherhood.” It’s just one example in a long line of insults and casually Islamophobic remarks Barr has dropped in the past.\nThough she’s deleted many of her tweets, she has constantly attacked Islam and retweeted people with the same abhorrent views. In one example, she referred to Islam and “RAPE PEDO CULTURE.”\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nAnd in one of the last episodes of the reboot, the plot centers around Roseanne Conner suspecting that her new Muslim neighbors might be terrorists.\nThat dog whistle could not have been louder, and still ABC did nothing.\nBarr is transphobic.\n“Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in our private bathrooms,” Barr tweeted in a 2012 tirade against a transgender woman who made headlines after using a women’s locker room.\n“I’m sorry, but a dick means you’re a man to me,” she wrote. “Maybe I’m old and out of it, but I can’t go there, sorry.”\nIt led to her getting into a lengthy Twitter spat with other users who called her out.\n“I can’t help but think that lots of these trans women sound like the worst red necked woman haters I grew up around in SLC Utah,” she tweeted at the time.\nSuch a victim.\xa0\xa0\nBarr called for a college to be bombed.\n\nIn a 2015 response to a vote in support of divestment from businesses with ties to Israeli military actions by the University of California, Davis, student government, Barr called for sectarian violence.\n\n\n“I hope all the jews leave UC Davis & it then it gets nuked!” she tweeted at the time. She followed up that tweet with “Nuke all UC David Jew-Haters.”\n\n\nAll of this is to say that ABC made the right call in canceling Barr’s show and sending her plummeting back into the void of obscurity.\xa0They just shouldn’t have pulled her from the void to begin with.\n\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nRoseanne Barr Just Said Another Very Racist Thing\n\n\n\n\n\nDictionary.com Accurately Defines Roseanne’s Tweets, In Case Anyone Was Confused\n\n\n\n\n\nWanda Sykes Says She’s Left ‘Roseanne.’ Others React To Barr’s Racist Remarks.\n\n\n\n",

He has claimed that the FBI had “infiltrated” and “spied”\xa0on his 2016 presidential campaign when the agency reportedly used\xa0an informant to make contact with Trump campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia. He also demanded the Justice Department investigate the accusations and turn over any relevant documents to Congress.\nMeanwhile, Democrats who attended a classified briefing about the informant with top DOJ officials last week said they saw “no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign.” Top Republicans who also attended the briefing have remained silent, however.\nAsked Sunday by CNN’s Dana Bash whether he believed the Russia probe is legitimate, Giuliani said, “Not anymore.”\n“I did when I came in, but now I see Spygate,” Giuliani said, using Trump’s preferred term for describing revelations that an FBI informant made contact with two of his campaign advisers as part of the investigation into Russia’s meddling.\n“I know 50 years of investigatory experience tells me they don’t have a darn thing because they would’ve used it already and they wouldn’t be off on collusion, they wouldn’t be off on Manafort, they wouldn’t be off on Cohen,” Giuliani added.\nWatch the full clip below:\n\n',

 {'title': 'Sarah Sanders: It ‘Bothers Me’ Being Called A Liar',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says it bugs her when people accuse of her lying to the press.\n“It certainly bothers me,”\xa0she\xa0told The New York Times in a Wednesday article. “Because one of the few things you have are your integrity and reputation.”\nBut Sanders has told lots of lies, and it’s not hard to give examples. PolitiFact cites four times\xa0the White House press secretary gave objectively false information.\nShe said in a November briefing that diversity visa immigrants are not vetted (false). She said in an October briefing that Chicago, which has high rates of gun-related crimes, has the toughest gun laws in the country (pants on fire!). She claimed in July that President Donald Trump has “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence” (false),\xa0despite\xa0videos showing otherwise. In March 2017 she\xa0said “multiple news outlets” reported that when he was president, Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump (false).\nSome of the things Sanders has said are laughably untrue.\nShe insisted this month\xa0that the Trump administration is “committed to a free press” ― right after Trump hinted at\xa0stripping reporters of their credentials and claimed, once again, that mainstream news outlets critical of his presidency are “fake news.”\nIn May 2017,\xa0she claimed there was not “ever an attempt” to blame Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite a statement that week from then–press secretary Sean Spicer putting the blame squarely on Rosenstein.\n\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\n\nLook at all the reporters’ hands in the air.\xa0Why can’t they get factually correct answers?\n\n\n\nIn her defense, Sanders’ job sounds bananas. She has to provide accurate information given to her by a president who lies all the time. And in this White House, the level of chaos and turnover has been so high, it’s not hard to imagine that something that may be true in the morning is no longer true by that evening.\n“There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying,” Sanders said in the Times piece.\nBut part of her dishonesty is in her unwillingness to acknowledge when the president has said something that just isn’t true.\nWhen a reporter asked Sanders in October why Trump kept falsely saying that the U.S. is the highest-taxed nation in the world, she gave a hilariously nonsensical answer.\xa0In July, when Trump randomly criticized Rosenstein for being from Baltimore, even though he is from Philadelphia, Sanders couldn’t even admit that was wrong. She said Trump was making a “general statement.”\nReporters confronted Sanders earlier this month about why she falsely told them that Trump did not reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for $130,000 in hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels just before the November 2016 election.\n“You said, on March 7, ‘There was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he’s denied all of these allegations,’” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the May 3 press briefing. “Were you lying to us at the time, or were you in the dark?”\xa0\nSanders said only that Trump still denies the allegations by Daniels.\n“I gave you the best information that I had, and I’m going to continue to do my best to do that every single day,” she said.\nAs Sanders does her best to be truthful, there’s one group she has no problem calling out as liars: all 16 women who say Trump sexually assaulted them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Saudi Arabia Told The World Its Problem Was Islam. It’s Actually Tyranny.',
  'body': '\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t apologize for much. In the past year, his government has massacred civilians\xa0in Yemen, kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and spent $450 million of unknown provenance on a painting while rounding up hundreds of people\xa0for alleged corruption. He’s publicly defended those actions. \nBut there’s one thing the crown prince is always willing to express remorse about: Islam, or at least the version dominant in his country. “We were victims,” he recently told “60 Minutes.”\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s pitch to governments, citizens and, most importantly, investors, explicitly plays on global Islamophobia and many Muslims’ own frustrations about the violence committed in the name of their religion. It neatly identifies Islam as a problem and the prince as the solution. And this summer is supposed to bring a marquee moment for the battle against fundamentalist Islam\xa0the crown prince says he’s fighting: On June 24, women will gain the legal right to drive in Saudi Arabia.\nBut the “reformer” prince’s rhetoric is colliding with the reality of his rule. Since May 15, his government has been arresting human rights advocates\xa0— among them some of the most prominent Saudi women activists — in a crackdown that perpetuates\xa0long-standing Saudi repression.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s pitch to governments, citizens and, most importantly, investors, explicitly plays on global Islamophobia and many Muslims’ own frustrations about the violence committed in the name of their religion.\n\nThe crown prince’s playbook is an old one. For strongmen in the Muslim-majority world, the trope of the scary Muslim is invaluable. It allows them to bond with skeptics of Islam abroad — remember the orb? — and constantly justify their continued rule. \nAfter all, the argument goes, do you really want their people in charge instead? It’s the kind of language Syrian President Bashar Assad proudly uses to declare himself a vital defender of secularism and paint his opposition, including peaceful activists, as essentially too Muslim.\nTalk of “moderation” and “modernization” has defined regional rulers seeking to solidify their control since at least the early 20th century. But Muslim leaders became especially invested in that language after the 9/11 attacks prompted global soul-searching about the roots of terrorism, according to Annelle Sheline, a George Washington University doctoral student who studies the way governments in the region brand themselves.\nThese leaders watched with alarm as members of the George W. Bush administration argued that the key to peace was spreading democracy.\n“The Middle East regimes were not so interested in having the spotlight shined on their activities or sharing their power,” Sheline said. Eventually, “the Bush administration was fairly willing to buy into the bill of goods that a lot of Arab regimes were selling, which was that it’s not authoritarianism, it’s Islam, and we need to change Islam.”\nSo the regimes promised change. The Saudis pledged to cut hate speech from their textbooks. Jordan gathered 200 scholars\xa0for a declaration of Muslim tolerance and unity. Around the region, governments expanded their control over what was preached and discussed in mosques. Implicit throughout was the idea that they could identify and enshrine a “correct” Islam for subjects always on the verge of falling for fundamentalists, and that that was all the change the world needed to deal with al Qaeda and its affiliates.\nWhen the 2011 Arab Spring protests exposed how unhappy and marginalized many Muslims remained, the region’s authoritarians were in a bind. Some — like Assad, and Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi — set off nightmarish civil wars. Others tried to be more subtle, working to boost fears internationally about the figures gaining political power for the first time.\n“It was like, ‘Oh, good, if we let them have democracy, we have the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, or else we get war in Syria.’ There’s definitely been this sense that clearly these people aren’t ready for democracy,” Sheline said. She believes that argument is flawed because it doesn’t acknowledge how violent undemocratic regimes inspire more violence in their societies.\n\nAround the region, governments expanded their control over what was preached and discussed in mosques. Implicit throughout was the idea that they could identify and enshrine a “correct” Islam for subjects always on the verge of falling for fundamentalists.\n\nClaiming to take big steps toward moderation is especially difficult for the rulers of Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Mohammed claims the kingdom has only espoused a strict interpretation of Islam since Iran began doing so in 1979. But the truth is that proponents of ultra-traditionalist theology have been allied with the royal family for over 200 years. \nUnderpinning that alliance is one goal: the survival of a regime in which the al Saud family and clerics close to them are all-powerful. As long as that remains the crown prince’s ultimate priority ― and he authorizes those working for him to punish even the slightest questioning of the system ― any moves away from state-sponsored orthodoxy won’t make his society more stable.\nAbroad, too, it’s unclear that the crown prince’s vows of change will help to reduce militancy. \nMuslim communities from Indonesia to Kosovo have claimed that Saudi influence is responsible for fundamentalism that never existed previously. Saudi proselytizing did become intense after Iran started challenging its regional dominance, and Crown Prince Mohammed has admitted as much.\xa0But Saudi government influence over preachers, books and centers abroad receiving Saudi funding actually started declining before 9/11 and the rise of the Islamic State. \nAnd it’s unclear that reining in the Saudi government’s religious intervention abroad or Saudi individuals’ influence in other countries will magically reshape Islam. Violence and alienation drove people in places like Tunisia and Pakistan to terror groups long before Saudi petrodollars started flowing into their societies;\xa0they will continue to do so long after. \nNone of that is to say the crown prince and his ilk should start advising Muslims to become less tolerant. “To the extent that anybody buys into [Western-backed governments’ ‘moderate’ narrative], that’s good.\xa0We’d rather have the government putting out messages around toleration and moderation,” Sheline said of the view among U.S. officials. \nBut the cracks within Saudi Arabia, a country of 20 million people and the center of the global trade in energy and weapons, are not going away. Clamping down on intellectuals, stoking nationalism against Iran and calling activists “traitors” won’t heal them. Nor will the flows of foreign capital that Crown Prince Mohammed has identified as his top target. \nReal change will require rethinking Saudi “practice” altogether — not just the religious kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration spent time last year mulling over what its public position on climate science should be — and, according to a report published Wednesday by The Washington Post, outrightly “ignoring” new research was one option that officials considered.\xa0\nCiting an internal memo drafted in September by President Donald Trump’s then-top energy and environmental aide, Michael Catanzaro, the Post reported that White House officials had discussed whether to “consider having a firm position on and a coherent, fact-based message about climate science ― specifically, whether, and to what extent, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are affecting the climate system, and what level of concern that warrants.”\nThree options were reportedly presented in the memo: The first was to conduct\xa0 “red team/blue team”\xa0debates to “highlight uncertainties” in climate data; the second was to review scientific studies under the Administrative Procedure Act; and the final option was to simply “ignore, and not seek to characterize or question, the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities.”\xa0\nAn option to endorse scientists’ findings was not put on the table.\xa0\nNo formal policy ever did materialize from the memo or subsequent discussions on the issue. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt was reportedly an advocate of holding “red team/blue team”\xa0debates to publicly critique climate science, but that idea was\xa0ultimately blocked by the White House, reported The New York Times in March.\nRemember that “red team, blue team” debate on climate change that Scott Pruitt proposed for E.P.A.? Here’s who killed it (at least for now).https://t.co/MDn5rCC8Qg— NYT Climate (@nytclimate) March 9, 2018\n\n\nAs the Post noted, the Catanzaro memo offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by the Trump administration on the issue of climate change.\xa0While White House officials continue to publicly downplay climate data and adopt policies to expand fossil fuel production in the U.S., federal agencies have continued to publish research showing that climate change is real, man-made and a growing threat to the U.S.\nOn Friday, for instance, the National Park Service published a report that said the effects of climate change, like rising sea levels and intensifying storms,\xa0could damage park sites across the country. The report’s lead researcher had earlier accused the Trump administration of attempting to censor the study by removing all mentions of human-caused climate change.\nFollowing public outrage, the paper was quietly published with the climate change references intact.\xa0\nOn Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers reacted with fury to the Post’s report.\n“Unacceptable and immoral,” wrote Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) on Twitter.\xa0\n“Ignoring the overwhelming evidence only sets us back further in addressing this serious threat,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).\xa0\n“Ignore,” distort, or censor. Those are the options the Trump White House is considering to deal with the overwhelming consensus on climate change. Unacceptable and immoral. We need a vision and a plan to #ActOnClimate, not willful ignorance. https://t.co/cT6O0sxXvX— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) May 24, 2018\n\n\nClimate change is real.

CBP says the accusations are “baseless.”\xa0\nOne 16-year-old filed a complaint alleging that a Border Patrol agent “threw him down and smashed his head into the ground with his boot,” according to the report. “The child also reported that as the same agent walked him to a Border Patrol vehicle, he told the child that he would ‘fuck [him] up’ if he tried to run away.”\nOther accounts point to the use of kicking, pushing, tasering, yelling and verbal abuse. Some complaints documented sexual abuse, including the touching of young girls’ buttocks and private parts.\xa0In addition, detained children reported the denial of clean facilities as well as food, water and medical care.\nThe agency, the report added, didn’t properly investigate the complaints it received. Although the Department of Homeland Security completed an investigation after complaints first\xa0surfaced in 2014, the ACLU argued that the practices didn’t change in the aftermath.\xa0\nCBP characterized the accusations as “unfounded and baseless.”\n“The ‘report’ equates allegations with fact, flatly ignores a number of improvements made by CBP as well as oversight conducted by outside, independent agencies,” CBP spokesman Dan Hetlage said in a statement.\nA 2014 surge in border crossings among minors, mainly from Central America, prompted the Obama administration to look for ways to speed up the deportation processes for children\xa0to confront the rising numbers.\xa0\n',

 {'title': 'Federal Prosecutors Still Trying To Turn Trump Inauguration Protesters Into Felons',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― Sixteen months after police swept up hundreds of people in mass arrests on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, federal prosecutors in the nation’s capital are trying to secure their first guilty verdicts against four defendants who participated in an anti-capitalism march that resulted in property damage in downtown D.C.\nThree of the four people they’re trying to convict actually damaged property, prosecutors contend. Each is facing\xa0five felony destruction-of-property charges, as well as one felony rioting charge,\xa0because the government argues they were part of a broader rioting conspiracy and can be held responsible for the broader damage.\nThe second J20 trial ― a reference to Jan. 20, 2017 ― comes five months after a D.C. jury acquitted six other Inauguration Day defendants\xa0on all charges following a lengthy trial. Prosecutors admitted from the beginning of the first trial that there was no evidence any of those defendants personally damaged any property, but told jurors they should be found guilty because they were part of a rioting conspiracy. Jurors disagreed.\nA few weeks later, in January of this year, the Justice Department dropped felony charges against 129 defendants but said it would press forward with 59 other cases. Another 20 individuals have pleaded guilty,\xa0mostly to misdemeanor charges.\nThe new trial unfolding in D.C. Superior Court this week involves defendants Michael Basillas, Seth Cadman, Anthony Felice and Casey Webber. All but Webber, the government alleges, actually took part in the destruction.\nUsing the same language about a “sea of black masks” that she used in the first trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff’s opening statement walked jurors through the property damage that occurred during the protest march and how it affected ordinary people.\nShe talked about the Starbucks worker who watched other workers dive for cover as glass windows “rained down upon them.” She spoke of the BP gas station employee who stacked cases of water against the door because the employee thought rioters would try to break inside. She talked about the limo driver who watched as his windows were smashed, the sandwich shop owner whose store was damaged, the hotel worker who hurried guests inside to prevent any injuries. She mimed the way protesters tossed newspaper vending boxes into the street and smashed windows. She said the defendants made the choice to participate in the destruction that day.\n“This trial is not about protest or disagreement or dissent,” Kerkhoff said,\xa0noting that protests can be powerful and beautiful and bring about change. But this wasn’t a protest, she said. “You can’t hide ― like a mask ― behind a protest.”\nPresent in the courtroom for Wednesday’s opening arguments were Jessie Liu, the Trump-named U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and Chelsea Manning, the WikiLeaks source whose lengthy prison sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama and who is now running for U.S. Senate in Maryland.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington is unique in that it’s an office headed by a presidential nominee that prosecutes crimes that would elsewhere be handled by local prosecutors. In the first trial, defense attorneys said the government’s actions against those who disrupted Inauguration Day were politically motivated. Defense attorneys may try similar tactics this time around and may also try to align their clients’\xa0actions with the broader opposition to Trump.\nRich Gallena, who represents Basillas, said his client took to the streets of Washington to exercise his First Amendment rights and stand up for minorities, immigrants and American workers. Only a small percentage of the group smashed windows,\xa0the lawyer said, and the photos that the government says show his client throwing a brick and attacking windows at a Starbucks outlet and a hotel are “grainy” and “blurred.” He pointed out how much time and effort the government had spent on the case.\n“They are desperate to pin that damage on someone, anyone,”\xa0Gallena said. But the evidence isn’t there, he added.\nCadman’s attorney, Seth Schrager, spoke of his own participation in protests against the Vietnam War and said the extensive amount of video that prosecutors would use in the case wouldn’t prove anything against his client. Kerkhoff said video shows Cadman chucking an object at a Bank of America location.\nMatthew Rist, representing Felice, called the trial a case of “guilt by association” and described what he said was excessive force against his client, who is also charged with resisting arrest. Kerkhoff said that Felice lit flares and tried to break a window and that he’d also nearly escaped the police “kettle” maneuver that ensnared the group. Rist said police gave Felice “a good baptism” of pepper spray after he was thrown to the ground and posed no threat to them.\nWebber’s attorney, April Downs, started by listing all the things that her client didn’t do. He didn’t hit a window or toss a trash can. He didn’t have any hammers or rocks. The only reason he was on trial, she said, was that he received messages about the planning of the event ahead of time that contained information the government didn’t like.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nAll 6 Defendants Not Guilty In Key Felony Trial Of Trump Inauguration Protesters\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Department Drops Felony Charges Against 129 Trump Inauguration Defendants\n\n\n\n\n\nInside The Trial That Could Determine The Future Of Free Speech In America’s Capital\n\n\n\n\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

  'body': '\nTeachers whose protests have\xa0spread across the country scored one of their first major electoral victories on Tuesday night, when Travis Brenda, a teacher at Rockcastle County High School in Mount Vernon, Kentucky, defeated the state’s House majority leader in a Republican primary.\nBrenda ousted GOP state Rep. Jonathan Shell by 123 votes in Kentucky’s 71st House District to win a primary less than two months after educators\xa0blanketed the state capitol in protests over pension and budget cuts. The Associated Press called the race ― one of the state’s most closely-watched primaries ― late Tuesday evening.\nAs the Republican House majority’s floor leader, Shell helped craft and pass a slate of controversial changes to the state’s public pension system that drew the ire of teachers and other state employees in late March and early April.\xa0In response to the legislation, which was tucked into a bill that previously dealt with public sewage, teachers shut down school districts in dozens of counties across the state on multiple days.\nBrenda opposed the pension cuts and was one of at least 40 teachers seeking public office in Kentucky during the 2018 cycle.\xa0\nSixteen of those candidates had primaries on Tuesday, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader, which reported that Brenda used his victory speech to credit state employees and teachers for helping him push back against Gov. Matt Bevin (R) and Republican leaders “for what they did on the pension bill.”\n\nTravis Brenda was one of at least 40 teachers seeking public office in Kentucky during the 2018 cycle.\n\nKentucky’s teacher protests also targeted Bevin’s proposed cuts to the education budget, which has faced 20 separate rounds of spending reductions in the last three decades, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. The state legislature eventually voted to restore funding to many of the programs Bevin had sought to cut.\nBut that hasn’t suppressed dissatisfaction with the governor or his allies in the legislature, especially as Bevin continued to criticize teachers in radio and television interviews (in one such case, Bevin blamed the teacher protests for instances of child abuse before later apologizing.)\nTeachers were successful in other Kentucky races, too, though none scored a victory quite as significant as Brenda’s.\nUnofficial results from the Kentucky Secretary of State showed\xa0that retired teachers Linda Edwards and Tom Williamson and current educators Jenny Urie and Lisa Willner appeared to have won Democratic primaries in state House races. Western Kentucky University history professor Patti Minter had a lead in her Democratic primary with nearly all precincts reporting late Tuesday night. And Scott Lewis, a school superintendent in Ohio County, won the Republican nomination in his House district.\nAmid the protests, teachers repeatedly promised that when it came time to vote in November, they would target lawmakers who’d supported changes to the pension system and further cuts to state education budgets. Now they’ve delivered a strong early warning to Bevin and those lawmakers that they have the power to follow through on the threats.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\n\n\nRep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) isn’t running for Congress again next year because he’s fed up ... particularly with talking about Trump.\n“No matter what I say or do, I feel all I do is answer questions about Donald Trump rather than health insurance or tax policy,” said Costello in a report by CNN that interviewed three of the many Republicans leaving the House at the end of this year.\nCostello revealed that he’s not seeking re-election because it’s been extremely trying to juggle work and family while working in a state that’s been rapidly shifting its dominant political party.\nOn the current state of Congress, the 41-year-old said, “I feel, increasingly, that if you’re a member of Congress, they assume that you’re not good. They assume that you’re not telling the truth. No matter what you do, someone’s out there locked and loaded to say something disparaging, false, mean, in an attempt to have other people not like you.”\nThe congressman elaborated by saying that since the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court redrew the district, it’s far more Democratic-leaning. For him to not run again was a no-brainer.\n“I have an 8-month-old. I have a 4-year-old. I just lost half my congressional district.

 {'title': 'Trump Blocking People On Twitter Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules',
  'body': "\nA federal judge ruled Wednesday that President Donald Trump may not block people on Twitter over the political views they share on social media ― a tactic his administration has employed against at least dozens of people.\xa0\nSiding with the Knight First Amendment Institute in a lawsuit\xa0against Trump and his communications team, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in New York concluded that blocking people on Twitter violated their First Amendment rights. Trump was engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by blocking critics in a “public forum,” the court ruled.\n“We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account ― the ‘interactive space’ where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President’s tweets ― are properly analyzed under the ‘public forum’ doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court,” Buchwald said in her ruling.\nTwitter is often the first communication channel Trump turns to when making major announcements. Last July, for example, he used the social media outlet to reveal his plans to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. armed forces.\xa0\nThe ruling notes that “the @realDonaldTrump account has been used in the course of the appointment of officers (including cabinet secretaries), the removal of officers, and the conduct of foreign policy.”\nIn addition to the president, defendants named in the lawsuit include former White House communications director Hope Hicks, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and social media director Dan Scavino\xa0―\xa0the man thought to be behind much of Trump’s unusual social media behavior. However, Buchwald excused Hicks and Sanders as defendants.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday’s ruling also addresses a suggestion made by a judge last summer that Trump instead “mute”\xa0his Twitter critics ― an option on Twitter that would allow the president to hide them from his feed but remain visible in theirs.\n“Muting equally vindicates the President’s right to ignore certain speakers and to selectively amplify the voices of certain others but ― unlike blocking ― does so without restricting the right of the ignored to speak,” she wrote.\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of seven Twitter users whom Trump blocked on the platform.\xa0Other well-known people blocked from his account include author Stephen King, actor Rosie O’Donnell and model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen.\nBuchwald ruled that unblocking the plaintiffs would be a “minimal” intrusion on executive prerogative, although she stopped short of ordering it outright.\n“We must assume that the President and Scavino will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional,” she wrote.\nSeveral plaintiffs in the case celebrated the ruling on Twitter.\xa0\nI sued the President, and I won. https://t.co/hE3rWcxIAY— RPBP (@rpbp) May 23, 2018\n\n\nBREAKING: President Trump’s blocking of critics on Twitter is unconstitutional, court rules.

 {'title': 'Illinois Ratifies Equal Rights Amendment 36 Years After The Congressional Deadline',
  'body': '\nMore than 45 years after it was approved by Congress, Illinois has become the 37th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\xa0\nThe Illinois House passed the measure 72-45 on Wednesday ― more than three decades after the expiration of the ratification deadline. The state Senate voted in favor of the resolution, 43-12, last month. The measure does not require the approval of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.\n“I am appalled and embarrassed that the state of Illinois has not done this earlier,” said Rep. Stephanie Kifowit (D-Aurora) following the House vote, the Chicago Tribune\xa0reported. “I am proud to be on this side of history and I am proud to support not only all the women that this will help, that this will send a message to, but I am also here to be a role model for my daughter.”\nThe #EqualRightsAmendment has passed the #Illinois House of Representatives, making this state the 37th US State to ratify the amendment. #SJRCA4 #ERAIllinois #ERA pic.twitter.com/KTbHqFJ4UX— Rae Hodge (@RaeHodge) May 31, 2018\n\n\nThe constitutional amendment, which declares that equality of rights “shall not be denied by the U.S. or any state on account of sex,” was first introduced in Congress in the 1920s. It was sent to the states for ratification in 1972, but only 35 states ratified the amendment by the congressionally set 1982 deadline — three states short of the 38 required to append it to the Constitution.\nThe issue languished in the intervening decades and was generally assumed to be a lost cause. But last year, debate around the amendment was revived when Nevada\xa0chose to ratify it. The Los Angeles Times reported at the time that pay inequality, as well as perceptions that the Trump administration was rolling back women’s rights, had spurred the Nevada vote.\nRoberta Madden of the ERA-NC Alliance in North Carolina, a state that has yet to ratify the amendment, said the\xa0Me Too movement has also played a role in propelling momentum for the ERA in recent years.\xa0\n“There’s been a lot more interest and a lot more attention in the news media about some of the wrongs against women and the inequalities that we face,” Madden told Vox. “That’s focused the attention in a way that it hasn’t before.”\nWith Illinois now on board, just one more state is required in order to ratify the amendment. According to the State-Journal Register, Congress will then need to remove the deadline for it to be included in the Constitution.\xa0\nThe states that have yet to ratify the amendment are:\xa0Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia and Utah.\n\n\n\n\nElijah Nouvelage via Getty Images\n\n\nDebate\xa0about the ERA was revived last year when Nevada chose to ratify the amendment.\n\n\n\nThe tight vote in the Illinois House underscores how political the issue is and the challenges that supporters will face as the amendment inches toward potential approval.\xa0Abortion is a central part of the debate.\xa0Opponents argue that the amendment is merely a “smokescreen” to enable the removal of abortion restrictions.\xa0\n“The only alleged benefit I can see and that I’ve heard about or seen argued in court is that it will expand taxpayer funding of abortions,” said Illinois Rep. Peter Breen (R-Lombard) this week,\xa0per the Register. “They have no other thing they want to do, and they’ll say ‘it’s silliness to talk about that.’”\nSupporters refuted the suggestion that the amendment was about abortion, and said it remains “relevant and necessary” to codify equal rights for women in the document that forms the foundation of all U.S. law.\xa0\n“By ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, we can provide a strong legal protection for women’s rights and prevent rollbacks from Congress or presidential administrations,” Sen. Heather Steans (D-Chicago), who sponsored the resolution in the Senate, said\xa0in a statement. “This amendment is still relevant and necessary.”\xa0\nUnisex bathrooms and allowing men to compete on women’s sports teams were also concerns that opponents raised.\xa0\nIllinois Rep. Jeanne Ives (R-Wheaton) argued that women are already amply protected under the law and it’s men that need to just “stop the sexual harassment” and other offenses against women.\xa0\n“We’ve made a lot of progress in this area, and we have a number of laws on the books already to protect women,” Ives said. “The fact of the matter is that women will not be protected until men decide to protect them and decide to stop the sexual harassment, decide to stop the domestic abuse, decide to stop the sex trafficking, decide in the workplaces when they are in charge that they will protect the women under their charge.”\nEqual Rights Amendment passes; it was several votes under, then agter legislators cheered “come on!” it surpassed the needed 71 votes, with bipartisan support (and bipartisan opposition). GOP leader Jim Durkin one of several Republicans voting for the ERA. pic.twitter.com/Dz1mryjuSC— Amanda Vinicky (@AmandaVinicky) May 31, 2018\n\n\nSteans urged Virginia’s legislature, which considered ratifying the amendment earlier this year but failed to do so, to take up the issue again.\n“After nearly 50 years of opposition, we are just one state away from ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution,” Steans said. “I encourage my colleagues in Virginia to continue the charge and become the final state to ratify the ERA.”\nClarification:\xa0Language in this story has been amended to include additional details about how the Me Too movement has influenced the push for the ERA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Facebook’s New Ad Rules Prove It’s Basically In Charge Of Regulating Elections Now',
  'body': "\nFacebook began disclosing political advertising on its site on Thursday, two years after a Russian troll factory bought ads to influence the 2016 presidential election. The new policy is meant to shine light on the previously undisclosed ways that politicians and other groups aim to shift public opinion on elections and political issues. But the self-regulatory approach will occur at Facebook’s direction and without any public oversight.\nThe social media giant will require all election-related ads and many issue-related political ads placed on its platform and on Instagram to disclose the buyer’s identity, the advertising budget, how many people saw the advertisement and their demographic information ― age, location and gender. Starting from May 7, 2018, all ads will remain in a searchable archive for seven years.\nUsers will also be able to report advertising that they believe should be disclosed as political. The company says it will hire 3,000 to 4,000 content moderators to review these complaints, and will deploy machine-learning algorithms when possible. (You can read more about this plan on Facebook’s blog.)\n\n\n\n\nDrew Angerer via Getty Images\n\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) questions witnesses during a committee hearing with examples of Russian-created Facebook pages behind him, Oct. 31, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to ads that explicitly call for the election or defeat of a candidate, Facebook is also targeting issue-based advertising. The company explained in a blog post that it worked with the nonpartisan Comparative Agendas Project to select 20 issues that will be covered by the disclosure policy, ranging from abortion to foreign policy to Social Security. An ad calling for the Department of Education to ban the use of public student loans at for-profit colleges, for example,\xa0would need to be disclosed. An ad run by a specific for-profit college that simply promoted the school would not.\nFacebook’s new policy follows the company’s revelation to Congress in 2017 that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian digital propaganda company that works with both the public and private sector in the country, purchased advertisements for a range of pages that sought to inflame American racial tensions and that, depending on the page, advocated for the election of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Jill Stein or Bernie Sanders. In some cases, these pages bought ads to gain followers in the U.S. and later called for voters to boycott the election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first announced plans to require political ad transparency in a speech from Facebook headquarters in September 2017.\nWhile Facebook’s moves are supported by advocates of online political advertising disclosure, the new policy also highlights how the failure of elected officials and regulatory agencies to impose actual disclosure rules through the democratic process is enabling the private sector to assert its authority over the conduct of U.S. elections.\n\nThe failure to regulate this space all together is a pretty abject failure.\nJohn Wonderlich, Sunlight Foundation executive director\n\nFacebook’s new disclosure plan is not bound by federal regulations and will not be overseen by the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission. In 2014, Ann Ravel, then the chairwoman of the FEC, proposed a meeting to discuss the disclosure of online ads. Her Republican colleagues pilloried her for the suggestion, and conservative news sites claimed she was trying to destroy free speech and censor their views. Ravel received a torrent of anti-Semitic death threats, and the three FEC Republicans voted against a rule to mandate online ad disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The failure to regulate this space all together is a pretty abject failure,” John Wonderlich, executive director of the pro-transparency nonprofit Sunlight Foundation, told HuffPost. “So, now we have private sector campaign finance regulation. That’s a pretty dystopian present.”\nThe public is now left with the Facebook Election Commission ― and maybe the Google Election Commission and the Twitter Election Commission. Both Google and Twitter have proposed some form of online ad disclosure on their respective platforms after they were also used by Russian trolls in 2016. For now, online political ad disclosure will be balkanized, as digital platforms will have different policies due to a lack of federal enforcement.\nIn some cases, that may result in stronger disclosure requirements than Congress or the FEC would mandate, as seen with Facebook’s broad issue-advertising disclosure approach. In other cases,\xa0though, the lack of public enforcement will likely result in worse outcomes. Indeed, that is also the case with Facebook, which launched a searchable archive of political ads that is only accessible if you have a Facebook account. This means a person must submit to Facebook’s terms and conditions, including the collection of personal data, if they want to learn about the election ads purchased by U.S. politicians. Rob Leathern, Facebook’s director of product, said on Twitter that the company is considering ways to open the archive to non-users. A Facebook spokesman said the company would not collect data on what people search for in the political ad archive in order to better target ads at them.\n\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\xa0testifies before the House energy and commerce committee in Washington, D.C., on April 11, 2018.\n\n\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a lead sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill to officially mandate online ad disclosure, praised Facebook’s decision in a tweet but noted the underlying problems of industry self-regulation.\n“Big step in the right direction ― and I’m glad Facebook followed through on my recommendations to improve upon earlier proposals,” Warner tweeted\xa0Thursday. “I’ll be pushing other companies to follow suit. But until we pass the #HonestAds Act, there’ll still be a patchwork of disclosure across social media.”\nSo far, the Republican-controlled Congress has refused to move the bill through committee or to the floor for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is a notorious opponent of any and all campaign finance regulation or disclosures.\nMeanwhile, commissioners on the FEC, the nation’s actual election disclosure regulator, spent Thursday arguing over whether they should release a report on their 40th anniversary. That 40th anniversary was three years ago.\n",

 {'title': 'Blake Farenthold May Have Been Hired Illegally At His New Lobbyist Job',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON ― Disgraced former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) may have been hired illegally at his new job at a Texas port authority, and a local newspaper on Monday filed a lawsuit that could result in his being ejected.\nFarenthold, who abruptly resigned from Congress last month while under investigation for sexual harassment, announced last week that he landed a gig as a lobbyist for the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca, Texas.\nThe problem is that the local government entity did not give public notice that it was hiring Farenthold or that it was creating a job for him that pays $160,000 a year. Under the Texas Open Meetings Act, public entities must give notice of actions being taken at upcoming meetings and allow for public comment. The port did give notice of its May 9 meeting, after which Farenthold was hired, but it used vague language about personnel matters.\n“They didn’t even talk about the fact that they were hiring a lobbyist, much less that it was Blake Farenthold,” said Joe Larsen, a Houston-based attorney who serves on the board of directors for the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Specificity has to match the level of public interest.”\nThe Victoria Advocate, a local Texas newspaper, filed a lawsuit with the Calhoun County district court on Monday arguing that the port violated state law and demanding that the law be upheld.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the newspaper prevails, Farenthold will be out of a job. The port could always rehire him, but it would first have to hold a public meeting letting anyone in the community weigh in.\n“He is an ex-congressman, with the history he has, and his position is unprecedented,” said John Griffin, a lawyer representing the newspaper. “Those details are of high public importance.”\nHere is a copy of the complaint:\n Calhoun Port Authority complaint by jen_bendery on Scribd\nFarenthold did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA request for comment from the port authority’s attorneys was not returned. They have asked the Texas attorney general for an opinion on whether Farenthold’s hiring was illegal, though that process could take up to a year, and the attorney general’s opinion won’t matter if the court rules in favor of the paper.\nChris Cobler,\xa0the editor of the Victoria Advocate, wrote an editorial\xa0on Sunday laying out the paper’s reasoning for taking legal action. He emphasized that the lawsuit\xa0isn’t about whether the port should or shouldn’t have hired Farenthold, but about open government.\n“This is about reminding our elected officials that they work for the public,” Cobler told HuffPost.\nBut it is a mystery why the port authority brought on Farenthold. His job is to lobby Congress, where he has burned bridges with his former colleagues. Not only did he get sued for sexual harassment by a former aide, but he never paid back $84,000 in taxpayer money he used to settle that lawsuit ― even after publicly vowing in December to repay it immediately. Lawmakers in both parties have been badgering him for months to pay it back, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to no avail.\nThe port authority’s board of directors is meeting Thursday to decide what to do about Farenthold’s job,\xa0according to a public notice issued Monday.\nGriffin, who said he personally knows all the board members, couldn’t say why they hired him in the first place. But he proposed a relatively easy way for the port authority to move past the mess that has come with Farenthold.\n“They could discharge him,” Griffin said. “If they decide he reneged on his commitment to repay taxpayers for a settlement in a case against him and that his brand name clearly has been tarnished, that would give the port good grounds to let him go.”\nHe added, “But that’s a question of wisdom, not legality.”\n",

 {'title': 'Trump Lawyer Attended DOJ Meeting On Confidential FBI Informant',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― Top congressional lawmakers and a White House attorney met with Justice Department officials on Thursday to discuss classified information about an FBI informant involved in the investigation into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election.\xa0Democrats have denounced the sit-down as inappropriate and contrary to the rule of law.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans had requested the information for weeks, issuing a subpoena and warning top DOJ officials that if they refused they would hold them contempt of Congress.\nEmmet Flood, the White House attorney dealing with the Russia investigation, attended\xa0part of the classified briefing and was spotted leaving the DOJ headquarters alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), and White House chief of staff John Kelly. None of the men took questions from a contingent of reporters standing watch.\nThe White House later said in a statement that Kelly and Flood made brief remarks at the beginning of the meeting to “relay the President’s desire for as much openness as possible” and departed before it actually began.\nThe unusual meeting had become highly politicized in recent days as President Donald Trump, a possible subject of the probe, ratcheted up attacks against the investigation, the Justice Department and the FBI. He has claimed that the FBI had “infiltrated” and “spied”\xa0on his 2016 presidential campaign when the agency reportedly used\xa0an informant to make contact with Trump campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.\xa0\nThe president demanded the Justice Department investigate the accusations and turn over any relevant documents to Congress.\nWhite House involvement in an investigation Justice Department investigation is rare. Trump has routinely broken norms about how the White House interacts with the Justice Department, which is supposed to have a degree of independence. While the presidency can certainly shape the direction of the Justice Department through nominations and help broadly outline priorities, the White House is not supposed to be involved in individual cases.\nTypically, administrations are eager to steer clear of any actions which might give an appearance of politicization of the Justice Department.\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee,\xa0said the meeting on the classified information had not changed his view that the FBI followed proper procedures during their investigation.\n“Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures or protocols,” Schiff told reporters after the meeting.\nJustice Department officials initially invited only Nunes and committee member Gowdy to review the classified information regarding the FBI informant and the agency’s purported monitoring of Trump campaign officials.\xa0Democrats immediately criticized the move, accusing the GOP of politicizing intelligence by initially excluding Democrats from the classified briefing.\xa0\xa0\n“Never has there been anything so disrespectful of the Congress than what they’re doing today,”\xa0House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday. The California Democrat said she had directed Schiff to attend in her place so as to make sure “henchmen of the president” do not interfere with the investigation.\nJustice Department officials also briefed other members of Congress ― the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” composed of congressional leaders and the top members of the intelligence committees from both parties― on Thursday afternoon. Kelly and Flood made similar remarks in that meeting as well before departing shortly after they began.\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, later criticized their presence at the latter meeting.\n“There’s never been a Gang of Eight meeting with that kind of White House presence,” he\xa0said.\n',

 {'title': 'Americans Are Split Over The NFL’s Decision On Anthem Protests',
  'body': '\nAmericans are close to evenly divided over the NFL’s new policy\xa0that allows the league to fine teams whose players sit or kneel during the playing of the national anthem.\nIn a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 41 percent of Americans say that teams should be fined if their players kneel in protest, while 44 percent say they should not. The rest aren’t sure.\nViews are divided along racial lines: half of white Americans but just 13 percent of black Americans approve of the fines. But the divide along political lines is even starker, with 81 percent of Donald Trump voters and just 12 percent of those who backed Hillary Clinton\xa0supporting fines levied against the teams.\nThe NFL protests ― and Trump’s criticism of them ― set off a storm of controversy last fall, with Americans disapproving both of the protests and of the president’s response.\xa0\nAmericans say, 49 percent to 35 percent, that it’s inappropriate for NFL players to kneel, largely unchanged from the 48/36 split on the issue in September of last year. Trump voters remain almost universal in condemnation of the protests,\xa0with 92 percent considering them inappropriate. Just 17 percent of Clinton voters and 44 percent of nonvoters say the same.\xa0\xa0\nOf those Americans who find the protests inappropriate, 8 percent currently say players should find a different way to protest during games, while 76 percent say players should protest only outside of their professional life and 13 percent that players should not protest at all.\xa0The new NFL policy allows players to remain in the locker room during the anthem but mandates that they stand if they’re on the field while it plays.\n\n\n\nAlthough the NFL protests haven’t won most Americans’ hearts, they have largely gotten their message across, the survey finds. Last September, fewer than half of the public knew that the protests were aimed at police violence, while 40 percent thought they were mostly intended to target the president (respondents were allowed to select multiple options).\nIn the most recent poll, a 55 percent majority identify police violence as the main target of the protests, while fewer than 20 percent see it as a protest against Trump, the American flag or anything else.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nHuffPost\n\n\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 23-28 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.\xa0You can learn more\xa0about this project and\xa0take part\xa0in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

 {'title': 'Border Patrol Shooting Shakes Town Where Illegal Crossings Are Part Of Daily Life',
  'body': '\nRIO BRAVO, Texas ― The vague message J.C. Gonzalez received over the radio on May 23 led him to believe that it was the Border Patrol agent who’d been shot.\nBut when this tiny border town’s fire chief arrived on the scene, it was Claudia Gómez, an unarmed, 20-year-old Guatemalan immigrant, who lay dying in an empty lot, her legs tangled upon each other. The bullet from the Border Patrol agent’s firearm had pierced the left side of her forehead around her hairline and exited through the rear side of her skull. She was still breathing, so the chief drove back to the fire station, a few blocks away, to retrieve a neck brace and backboard to stabilize her head and spine. Then Gonzalez’s partner and a Border Patrol agent ― Gonzalez didn’t know whether it was the one who had fired the shot ― took turns administering chest compressions. \nBy the time emergency medical services arrived, Gómez was dead. Officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Webb County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Rangers and Laredo Police gathered around her body. A medical evacuation helicopter landed nearby. Marta Martinez, a resident who lived next to the empty lot, filmed the aftermath and streamed it live on Facebook, spreading the news to millions of people. When Gonzalez went back to the station, he left behind the medical supplies he’d brought, which became evidence in an investigation into the shooting led by the FBI. \xa0\n\nDetails remain scarce about the circumstances that prompted the 15-year veteran of Border Patrol, whom the agency has not named while the investigation proceeds, to pull the trigger. The circumstances appear damning.\nThe agent had responded to a report of illegal activity near a culvert where the town meets the river, according to Customs and Border Protection. The agency initially released a statement saying that the group refused to obey the agent when he confronted them and that some of them attacked him with “blunt objects.” CBP walked the story back the next day, saying instead the group had “ignored his verbal commands and rushed him.” Neither Gómez nor the group of three other unauthorized immigrants on the scene, who were later apprehended, were armed. The shooting took place midday on one of the town’s main streets, but no one has claimed publicly that they witnessed it.\nGómez’s family plans to sue Border Patrol over the killing.\n\n\n\n\nJOHAN ORDONEZ via Getty Images\n\n\nDominga Vicente shows a photo of her niece Claudia Gómez during a press conference in Guatemala City on May 25, 2018. The family demanded justice and called for her body to be sent back home so they could bury her in her native village.\n\n\n\nGonzalez, an Army veteran who worked for several years as a deputy sheriff, worried the incident would undermine trust with Border Patrol in a town where that confidence has always been scarce. In Rio Bravo, illegal crossings are so common that parents urge their kids to avoid playing in the river to keep from getting caught up in law enforcement operations and to use caution in the street to avoid Border Patrol trucks whizzing by. \nPeople in Rio Bravo have never trusted Border Patrol, Gonzalez said. And the agency’s reputation had already taken a blow earlier this year, when another Border Patrol agent who worked in the same county, Ronald Anthony Burgos Aviles, was arrested on accusations of killing his mistress and her 1-year-old son. \nSeveral residents ― most of whom declined to be named for fear of angering Border Patrol or inviting threats, like the ones Marta Martínez received after posting her video to Facebook ― viewed the shooting with suspicion.\nOne longtime resident who lives near the river said it was a common occurrence for people to run through his property and scale the fence to evade Border Patrol, before he put up a gate to keep them out. He also installed security cameras and wished his neighbors had too. “Yeah, I trust them,” he said, speaking in Spanish, of Border Patrol. “But then they do these things and you don’t. If it would’ve happened here, it would’ve been filmed and then we’d have evidence.” \nEven so, many of them are willing to give the agent the benefit of the doubt, given the lack of details about the first Border Patrol shooting in the city’s history. \n“No one likes them here,” another resident, speaking in Spanish, said of Border Patrol. But having crossed himself illegally in the past, he also knows first-hand the pressure that grinds upon the agents that used to chase him. “It’s like any other job,” he said. “You get frustrated. That will trick your mind.” \nMayor Francisco Peña would rather have been planning his town’s first city-sponsored Independence Day celebration when he heard of the shooting last week. He himself had crossed from Mexico at age 4, not knowing that he was an undocumented immigrant. (He adjusted his status decades later, after realizing that his father’s birth in Laredo qualified him for U.S. citizenship.) Peña went on to serve in the Army, fight in the Korean War, work as a teacher and become a medical doctor. \nHe suspected that Gómez, who earned a college degree in accounting but migrated after struggling to find work, might have have made similar contributions if given the chance.\nAs the leader of a town with an $800,000 budget and no local police force along the banks of an unfenced section of the Rio Grande, he wished he had more Border Patrol agents. People wade through the river almost every day, and he has little faith in the technology the agency uses to catch them. He’s seen people walk up from the banks of the river on all fours like dogs or roll like logs, which he thinks allows them to evade the Border Patrol’s sensors. \nBut after the killing, Peña found himself struggling to balance his sympathy for Gómez with his loyalty to the Border Patrol in a town where illegal crossings and drug trafficking are a fact of daily life. He feels certain the shooting was accidental, though he acknowledged it had unsettled the town, where many residents are undocumented. It was clear, he thought, that Gómez was not one of the “animals” the president sometimes spoke about.\xa0\nHe was frustrated, too: Over the last four years, the last two Republican governors have spent more than $2 billion to send state Department of Public Safety troopers and the National Guard to border towns like Rio Bravo. But the state ignored more mundane public safety requests.\n\n\n\n\nRoque Planas\n\n\nRio Bravo Mayor Francisco Peña displays architectural plans for a park the city will inaugurate on July 4, 2018. The park will sit directly across from the culvert where a migrant woman named Claudia Gómez allegedly crossed into the United States before a Border Patrol agent shot and killed her.\n\n\n\nWhen Tropical Storm Charley hit Rio Bravo in 1998, flooding at the edge of the Rio Grande destroyed several houses that remain abandoned to this day. Local officials insist that human traffickers and drug smugglers use the structures as safe houses. But state lawmakers in Austin ignored Peña’s requests since 2015 for funding to buy the properties from the current owners and tear them down. His last ask in January of 2017 totaled $200,000. \nMayor Peña doubts that the cat-and-mouse game between Border Patrol and the immigrants coming to his town to try to make a better life will ever end. But he hopes the killing won’t dampen the patriotic fervor he hopes to instill at the city’s first official Independence Day celebration in July. The abandoned houses will remain for now, but he’s looking forward to unveiling a new park, with an outdoor theater and public gathering space. It sits on Tuliapán Drive, directly in front of the culvert where CBP says that Gómez crossed. \nHe’s recruited young residents for a kite-flying show and goal-scoring contest on the new soccer field. And he’s curated a list of songs he hopes will encourage the town to feel the same sense of national pride that he does, including a special rendition of “America the Beautiful.” It’s by Tejano musician Jay Perez. \n“He makes the most beautiful version of ‘America, the Beautiful,’” Peña told a visitor Wednesday. “And he’s one of us.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nRep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is a longtime investor in a winery that was sued in 2016 for auctioning off a yacht party that\xa0allegedly involved cocaine and prostitutes, The Fresno Bee reported.\xa0\nAlene Anase, a former employee of Alpha Omega Winery, said the company had auctioned a 2015 cruise aboard its yacht for charity. Anase was asked to serve the 25 winning bidders, who were all men, according to court documents the Bee posted online.\xa0No owners or investors were on the cruise, the winery told the Bee.\xa0\nAccording to the lawsuit:\n\n“Plaintiff realized that the men had brought prostitutes, hard liquor, and what appeared to be cocaine onto the Yacht. Plaintiff was extremely disturbed by the presence of the prostitutes, especially because it appeared that some of the girls were too young to consent to sexual activity.”\n\nAnase’s lawsuit was eventually settled for an undisclosed amount, according to the Bee. The suit included six allegations, including sexual harassment, emotional distress and retaliation.\nThe men aboard the yacht\xa0“consumed large quantities of alcohol and a white substance Plaintiff understood to be cocaine,” the suit alleged, saying that at least one of the men approached Anase for sexual services and stated that she feared being sexually assaulted.\xa0\nAccording to the lawsuit, when Anase complained, the company’s marketing director allegedly ordered her to “‘lie low’ and try to do as little as possible in order to avoid harassment.”\nThe suit also claimed that Anase received counseling for psychological trauma, took medication for anxiety and depression, and suffered from panic and sleep problems, all as a result of the cruise.\nWine Business reported on the lawsuit in 2016 and said Alpha Omega Winery had continued to auction cruises for charity after the incident.\xa0\n“We refined our policies for the charitable donation of the yacht immediately upon learning of the incident and before a lawsuit was filed,” winery spokeswoman Kelly Carter told the website at the time.\xa0\nRobin Baggett, whom the Bee describes as a friend of Nunes, owns Alpha Omega Winery.\xa0It’s not clear how big of a stake Nunes has in the business, but the Bee reported that he is one of at least 50 investors, investing between $50,000 and $100,000 after selling his dairy farm in 2006 and earning between $2,501 and $5,000 from his investment in 2016.\xa0\nThe House Intelligence Committee chairman has not spoken much about the winery publicly over the years. However, when Time asked in 2010 what he would be doing if he wasn’t in politics, he said, “I’d be making wine and cheese.”\xa0\nHe did not comment on the yacht allegations, according to the Bee.\xa0\nThe Los Angeles Times said Nunes has three main assets: stakes in two wineries (Phase 2 Cellars and Alpha Omega Winery LLC)\xa0and a Bank of America savings account. The three are worth a combined $101,000, the outlet noted.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nLawyer Aaron Schlossberg is facing serious consequences after video footage captured his bigoted diatribe\xa0about workers and customers who were speaking Spanish to each other in a Manhattan restaurant on Tuesday.\nSince the video of his outburst went viral, the Trump supporter\xa0has been evicted from his law offices,\xa0named in a disciplinary complaint and chased by reporters. He’s been trashed on Yelp and singled out for a mariachi band serenade.\nEarlier this week, Schlossberg was filmed angrily complaining to a restaurant worker about the people speaking Spanish around him. He said he suspected they were in the country illegally and threatened to call the authorities. “They have the balls to come here and live off of my money I pay for their welfare,” he complained. “The least they could do is speak English.”\xa0\n\nIronically, the website for Schlossberg’s legal business\xa0— which has now been trashed online\xa0— boasts that he “speaks Spanish.”\nThe New York Daily News reported that Corporate Suites, the landlord of the Madison Avenue space that Schlossberg used for his legal business, barred him from his office on Thursday.\n\n“We’ve decided to terminate his agreement with us,” company president Hayim Grant told the News. “His actions don’t fall in line with our beliefs and our community. We’re a diverse community of global businesses that have mutual respect for each other.”\n\nExtra points to whoever changed the Google info for Aaron Schlossberg’s company to “Spanish restaurant” pic.twitter.com/sX4xUyd8H6— Adam Feldman (@FeldmanAdam) May 17, 2018\n\n\nMeanwhile, in a letter Thursday to the state court disciplinary system, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. (D) accused Schlossberg of misconduct for his “viral racist rant.” Diaz told The Washington Post that Schlossberg should be suspended or disbarred.\nSchlossberg ran from news reporters Thursday outside his Manhattan home. He called the police on his phone, saying he was being “accosted by reporters. Please send help.”\nSchlossberg is apparently no stranger to angry public confrontations captured on video.\nManhattan resident Willie Morris posted a vlog about his bizarre encounter with Schlossberg on a street in 2016. The lawyer bumped into Morris, called him an “ugly fucking foreigner,” and threatened to call the police.\n\nAnother person said that Schlossberg yelled at Jewish people in the street, accusing them of not being “real” Jews.\nThe asshole lawyer caught on video mad about people speaking Spanish in NYC that @ShaunKing is calling out?@Ike_Saul caught him on video yelling “You are not a Jew” to Jewish people last year.pic.twitter.com/rSl2rpnmZw— jordan (@JordanUhl) May 16, 2018\n\n\nSchlossberg could not be reached for comment.

 {'title': 'Lupe Valdez Makes History In Texas By Winning Democratic Nod For Governor',
  'body': '\nFormer Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Texas on Tuesday, kicking off a tough race against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November’s general election.\nValdez’s victory in a runoff ― while somewhat expected, after she ran well ahead of Democratic opponent\xa0Andrew White in the nine-candidate primary in March ― broke historic barriers as she becomes the first Latina and first openly gay person nominated for governor by a major party in the state.\nIn Valdez, Texas Democrats chose a lesbian woman of color running on a progressive platform over White, a straight, white Houston businessman and son of a former governor, running as a centrist.\nThank you, Texas! Tonight is for you! pic.twitter.com/onGtnEU53s— Lupe Valdez (@LupeValdez) May 23, 2018\n\n\nValdez,\xa070, faces an uphill battle against Abbott in November. The incumbent, who is favored to win, has amassed more than $40 million for his re-election campaign, while Valdez in recent months raised only\xa0about $200,000. Abbott beat his 2014 opponent, then-state Sen. Wendy Davis, in a landslide, despite strong national support behind the pink-sneakered, pro-choice candidate. \nThe solidly red state has also not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994. And it’s been since 1990 that a Democrat won the governor’s office.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Valdez,\xa0the eighth child born to Mexican-American migrant farmworkers, is used to overcoming long odds. When she became sheriff in 2004, she was the nation’s only Latina sheriff, and among the state’s first openly gay sheriffs. \nNow she aims to become Texas’ first-ever Hispanic governor. \nFor Latino Texans, her win would be a triumph of representation in a state where they make up nearly 40 percent of the population. \xa0\xa0\n“It’s long overdue to have Latinas sit in these halls of power,” native Texan Amy Hinojosa, president of national Latina organization MANA, told HuffPost last month. “When you think of the generations of girls to come, to see a Latina, a queer woman in the state house, that just represents such power for young women to be able to aspire to that.”\n\n\n\n\nLupe Valdez\n\n\nLupe Valdez, seen here at a Mardi Gras parade in Dallas in February 2017, is used to overcoming long odds and breaking barriers.\n\n\n\nA Valdez victory in November would also break barriers for the LGBTQ community, as she would become the nation’s first lesbian governor (Oregon Gov. Kate Brown,\xa0who took office in 2015, identifies as bisexual).\n“You want to see my scars?” Valdez joked to HuffPost in March, speaking of the discrimination she had faced as a queer woman in her career in Texas law enforcement. “The first four or five years [as sheriff] were extremely difficult. I got hate email and faxes. I got pushback from a lot of the good old boys.”\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT VALDEZ HERE\n\n\nLupe Valdez Could Make History As Texas’ First Hispanic Governor\n\n\n\nAnalysts say that for Valdez to win in November, it will be essential for her to increase historically low turnout among Latino voters, a demographic Democrats have long sought to galvanize in the state. Latino Texans tend to vote Democrat ― though in 2014, Abbott got 44 percent of the Latino vote.\nOn the key issue of immigration in the border state, where Trump wants to build part of his border wall, Valdez has made a name as a fierce opponent to Abbott.\n The governor signed the notoriously anti-immigrant Senate Bill 4 into law last year, which banned “sanctuary” policies that limit local cooperation with federal deportation efforts. In 2015, Valdez clashed with Abbott when she said Dallas County law enforcement officials would only cooperate with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on a case-by-case basis.\xa0\n“People who rape, murder and abuse, commit violent crimes, I have no trouble saying no to ― and I often joke I wish I could say that to a lot of Americans,” Valdez told HuffPost in March.\n“But people who came here for a better life, get picked up for a broken taillight or speeding, who make as many mistakes as the rest of us Americans make... which one of us who has no sin can cast the first stone?” she continued. “We should just leave them alone.”\nIn the lead-up to the runoff, Valdez had faced criticism from local Latinx activists who questioned her record on immigration as sheriff, saying her department often cooperated with ICE in handing over undocumented detainees. Valdez’s team told HuffPost in April that as a local official, she faced challenges in pushing back against the anti-immigrant efforts at the federal and state levels. \n\n\n\n\nLupe Valdez\n\n\nImmigration will be a key issue in Valdez’s bid to unseat Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\n\n\nAnother frequent critique of Valdez has been that she has appeared unprepared to address state-level policy issues ― a concern raised in local newspaper endorsements that went to White.\n“She’s demonstrated a really profound lack of understanding of major policy challenges facing Texas,” Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston and head of its Texas Politics program at the Baker Institute, told HuffPost last week.\nHe said that Valdez, during a recent debate with White, couldn’t answer simple questions about state budgets, and would “fall back on her relatively inspirational personal narrative ― and that’s all she has going for her.”\nResponding to such critiques and the endorsements White garnered, Valdez’s team told HuffPost last month that “she can’t win them all,” and she was “used to people telling her she can’t do it or it can’t be done. Time and time again, she has been underestimated and proved them wrong.”\xa0\nValdez’s victory will likely intensify speculation as to whether Texas could become a politically competitive state for Democrats.\nIn another Texas race that will be closely watched, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, also a Democrat, seeks to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n“Maybe not this year,” Brittany Perry, an assistant professor at Texas A&M University who specializes in U.S. politics and Latino representation, told HuffPost last month of Valdez’s chances of beating Abbott. “Maybe down the road. Maybe we’re paving the way for future Latino candidates in Texas.”\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story identified Rep. Beto O’Rourke as Latino; he is not.\xa0\n',

When Nextstar TV reporter Jessica Smith asked him about the effort on Wednesday, he responded indirectly by saying there are “significant” and “needed” changes happening at his agency and across the administration.\n“With great change comes, I think, opposition,” Pruitt said. \xa0\nI asked Scott Pruitt a quick question about the reports he tried to help his wife become a Chick-fil-A franchisee.  “With great change comes, I think, opposition...I love, she loves [Chick-fil-A]” pic.twitter.com/gND2tdMq1e— Jessica Smith (@JessicaASmith8) June 6, 2018\n\n\nThe emails, as first reported by The Washington Post, revealed that Pruitt ordered an aide to set up a call with the chairman of Chick-fil-A in May 2017 to discuss, on behalf of Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn Pruitt, the possibility of becoming a franchisee of the fast-food chain.\nShe never completed the application, a Chick-fil-A spokeswoman said Tuesday.

 {'title': 'Texas Governor’s School Safety Plan Proposes Modest Changes To Gun Laws',
  'body': '\nTwelve days after a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Wednesday released a wide-ranging set of proposals that he says will keep students safer.\nThe 43-page document covers a number of areas, including school security, mental health care and gun laws related to firearm safety.\nAt a press conference at the school district headquarters in Dallas, Abbott called the plan a “starting point,” while working to balance his standing as a gun rights supporter with his newfound willingness to explore modest reforms of firearm laws.\n“I doubt there has been a Texas governor with a more pro-gun record than myself,” Abbott said.\xa0“I can assure you, I will never allow Second Amendment rights to be infringed. But I will always promote responsible gun ownership, and that includes keeping guns safe and keeping them out of the hands of criminals.”\nAmong Abbott’s proposed changes to gun laws would be a strengthening of his state’s child access prevention law, which currently only applies to incidents in which a child under 17 obtains a “readily dischargeable” firearm from an adult’s property.\nThe alleged attacker in Santa Fe, a 17-year-old student, reportedly took his father’s legally owned revolver and shotgun and brought them to class concealed under a trenchcoat. Because of the gunman’s age, his parents can’t be held criminally liable for his actions under state law.\nAbbott said he supports adjusting the statute to cover anyone under 18, as well as strengthening the penalty to a third-degree felony in any case where child access results in death or serious bodily injury.\xa0The current law only provides for misdemeanor charges.\nThe law should also be clarified to include both loaded and unloaded guns stored around children,\xa0which could make it easier for prosecutors to pursue these charges, the proposal states. Recent reports have shown the Texas law is used very infrequently.\n\n\n\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters\n\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) speaks at the annual National Rifle Association convention in Dallas on May 4.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Abbott called for the legislature to authorize a study on a “red flag” law, which would allow law enforcement,\xa0family members, school employees or district attorneys to file petitions seeking the removal of firearms from dangerous individuals.\nEight states currently have red flag laws on the books, and three states, including Florida, have put these laws in place since the February shooting in Parkland. The NRA-affiliated Texas State Rifle Association has said it would oppose any such measure over concerns that it could lead to the violation of due process. Abbott has clarified that any confiscation of firearms must come after “due process is provided.”\nA Texas red flag law could have a substantial effect on shootings, said Ed Scruggs, spokesman for Texas Gun Sense, a nonprofit focused on gun violence prevention.\n“We believe that has a lot of potential to prevent major tragedies and especially suicides,” he told HuffPost.\nThe governor’s report specifically notes that red flag orders “could have been used to prevent the shootings” at Sutherland Springs, where 26 people were killed at a church in November, and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where 17 people were killed.\nAbbott also urged lawmakers to work on legislation to require gun owners to report when their firearms are lost or stolen within 10 days.\xa0An estimated 177,000 guns were stolen in Texas between 2012 and 2015, according to a 2017 report. Only 12 states currently require gun owners to report the loss or theft of a firearm.\nOverall, the proposal is far from perfect, Scruggs said. But considering the reliably fraught politics of the gun debate in Texas, it could have been worse.\n“There are some positive steps that most people would classify as moderate steps or basic steps, but for Texas it really represents some form of progress,” he said.\nAlthough Abbott’s willingness to discuss changes to gun laws may come as a surprise to some, most of his proposed measures don’t involve legislative reform.\n“The strategy that I most strongly encourage the Legislature to consider is greater investment in mental health,” Abbott said at Wednesday’s press conference.\nAbbott specifically described his support for expanding a telemedicine program designed to identify junior high and high school students at risk of committing violence and intervene by providing them with mental health services. The program, developed by Texas Tech University and facilitated through the university’s health services center, is already in use in a number of Texas school districts and has shown positive results in the form of reduced truancy and discipline among referred students.\nThe document lays out a number of measures to fortify schools by increasing the number of armed personnel,\xa0potentially including teachers, on campus. Other proposals would increase the use of metal detectors, monitoring and surveillance, and would explore new construction to maintain greater control of school entrances, exits and external access.\nAltogether, the initiatives would cost $110 million to implement, around $70 million of which is already available in the form of federal funding and state grants, according to the report.\nTo gun violence prevention advocates,\xa0it would be well worth the investment. Since 2009,\xa0Texas has experienced at least 20 mass shootings involving at least four fatalities apiece, the most of any state. These events have included the Sutherland Springs massacre, two separate shootings at Fort Hood, a 2016 attack on police officers in Dallas and many instances of domestic violence.\nAbbott’s plan follows three days of roundtable discussions held last week with a number of groups,\xa0as well as survivors of the Santa Fe shooting.\nMany of the measures in Abbott’s blueprint would require approval from the Texas Legislature, which is not currently in session.\xa0Abbott said he would be open to calling a special session to consider the bills, as long as there was “consensus” among lawmakers on some of the legislation.\nIf the governor doesn’t act, the legislature will reconvene in January, two months after the November elections, when Abbott will face Democrat Lupe Valdez, the former sheriff of Dallas County.\nIn the wake of the Santa Fe shooting, Valdez and others have called for Abbott to pursue stronger gun laws, and specifically universal background checks for all firearm purchases.\xa0Abbott’s plan dismisses that proposal, arguing that many criminals get firearms via the black market, where background checks don’t apply.\nRead the entire plan below:\n Texas School Safety Action Plan by Nick Wing on Scribd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'The Supreme Court’s Arbitration Ruling Is Already Screwing Thousands Of Chipotle Workers',
  'body': '\nThe Supreme Court issued a monumental decision on Monday, ruling that employers can require their workers to sign arbitration agreements giving up their right to sue in court as a group. The decision in Epic Systems v. Lewis will make it harder for workers to band together as victims of wage theft and discrimination, and its effects will be felt in the workplace for years to come.\nBut for a few thousand current and former Chipotle workers, its effects may be felt immediately. Their case is a perfect example of how the Supreme Court’s ruling will benefit powerful companies at the expense of their employees, many of them working for low wages in industries like fast food.\nRoughly 10,000 people who have worked for the burrito chain joined a 2014 lawsuit alleging the company systemically forced them to work “off the clock.” They claim that Chipotle gives its restaurants so little payroll that managers require employees to clock out and continue working or perform work before they clock in. They’re suing to recoup the money they claim Chipotle owes them for the uncompensated work.\nBut Chipotle has been arguing that 2,814 workers in that group do not have a valid claim because they signed class- and collective-action waivers when they accepted their jobs. Late last year, the company provided the court with a 62-page list of workers in the lawsuit who had supposedly signed away their rights and asked the judge to exclude them from the proceedings. \nThe judge has not ruled on that request yet. But thanks to Justice Neil Gorsuch and the rest of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, Chipotle may soon get its wish. The judge in the case issued an order Wednesday inviting the parties to submit new briefs by June 6 in light of the Epic Systems ruling.\xa0\n\nTheir case is a perfect example of how the Supreme Court’s ruling will benefit powerful companies at the expense of their employees.\n\nIn the decision penned by Gorsuch, the court ruled that a worker’s right to join with other workers in mutual aid or protection under the National Labor Relations Act does not invalidate a class-action waiver the worker entered into. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision “egregiously wrong” in her dissent, arguing that the right to band together with other workers isn’t worth much if a worker must give up that right in order to get a job.\nWhat the ruling most likely means for the Chipotle lawsuit is that roughly 7,000 workers will be able to pursue their claims collectively, while nearly 3,000 other workers will not. If the judge grants Chipotle’s request to exclude the latter, those workers would have to go individually and in private before an arbitrator. That is, if they happen to find a lawyer willing to take on a case with a claim that may be smaller than the cost of litigating it. \n“This is almost a perfect social experiment, unfortunately,” said Moshe Marvit, a labor lawyer and fellow at the Century Foundation think tank. \nAll the plaintiffs did similar work for the same company and share the same grievance. The only difference is whether they had the misfortune to start working for Chipotle after the company implemented a mandatory arbitration agreement that includes a class-action waiver. \xa0\xa0\nChipotle declined to answer questions from HuffPost about why it instituted mandatory arbitration for its employees and how it makes sure that employees actually understand what they’re agreeing to. It also declined to answer questions about the underlying accusation of the case ― that it didn’t pay thousands of low-wage employees for work they performed.\nDepositions in the lawsuit, however, help shed some light. According to court filings, Chipotle began requiring prospective employees to sign class-action waivers in August of 2014. If they didn’t sign, then they did not get their jobs. Since then, tens of thousands of workers have agreed to take any claims to arbitration as individuals.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the majority in the Epic Systems case.\n\n\n\nThe legal contracts were included in the onboarding materials that applicants go through online when they’ve been approved for a Chipotle job, according to the lawsuit. Its significance wouldn’t necessarily jump out at an applicant: Other documents in the bunch include the employee handbook and the manual on hand-washing, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements.\nThe Supreme Court decision is premised on the idea that the two parties are voluntarily entering into an agreement to take any workplace dispute to arbitration. But in a deposition, a Chipotle lawyer explained how voluntary these two-party contracts really are in practice:\n“[I]f you choose not to agree to the arbitration agreement, for example, once you have been given notice and an opportunity to look at it, read it, ask any questions, download it, save it, whatever you want to do ― if you don’t, then you don’t have to be an employee,” said David Gottlieb, who’s listed on LinkedIn as the company’s director of compliance.\nHuffPost readers: Are you part of an employment lawsuit that could be affected by the Supreme Court’s decision? Email us about it.\nMost workers don’t closely read the pile of documents they have to go through when they’re accepting a job. And even if they did, any worker ― let alone one without a high level of education ― may not fully understand the implications of what they’re agreeing to. They may also be reluctant to ask questions and come off as a troublemaker or to hold up their own hiring once they’ve been offered a job.\nGottlieb testified that the onus was on the workers to understand what they’re signing.\xa0\n“The obligation of the employee is to do whatever they need to understand what it is they are agreeing to,” Gottlieb said.\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs asked Gottlieb what would happen if, say, a worker got to the arbitration agreement but couldn’t read it.\n“[I]f you’ve gotten that far in the onboarding steps and you are only now discovering that you can’t understand what’s going on, boy. ... I’m wondering whether we should hire you because you should be asking for help earlier,” Gottlieb responded.\nGottlieb testified that workers agree to the arbitration agreement by checking an electronic box, rather than making an actual signature. He acknowledged that a worker could check the box without even opening the document.\n“Yes, you could do that, but at your own peril,” he said.\nKent Williams, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told HuffPost that his clients didn’t comprehend what they were agreeing to when they took their jobs with Chipotle.\n“Virtually none of them remembers signing it. And by ‘signing it,’ I mean they click ‘agree,’” Williams said. ”They’re not reading this stuff, and they’re not understanding this stuff.”\nAs labor unions have lost much of their influence in the U.S., class-action lawsuits have become one of the main ways workers can band together with a grievance and take on the boss. Forcing workers into arbitration as individuals drains much of that collective power. That’s what Justice Stephen Breyer was getting at when he said during the Epic Systems oral arguments that the case strikes at “the entire heart of the New Deal.”\n\nThe obligation of the employee is to do whatever they need to to understand what it is they are agreeing to.\nDavid Gottlieb, Chipotle’s director of compliance\n\nIf Chipotle workers are carved out of their lawsuit, they could still pursue their claims in arbitration. But there’s reason to think many of them would not. \nBecause these workers earn low wages, their individual claims are inherently small. According to Williams, the claims range anywhere from $50 to several thousand, depending on how long one worked at Chipotle. A lawyer might take that case on if there are enough plaintiffs in a class- or collective-action lawsuit, but an individual arbitration case may not be worth the lawyer’s time. As Ginsburg wrote in her dissent, “Expenses entailed in mounting individual claims will often far outweigh potential recoveries.” \nA worker could still pursue the case without an attorney. But they probably don’t have a strong handle on the Fair Labor Standards Act and the ins and outs of minimum wage and overtime law, and they would be facing off against a lawyer for Chipotle, a company with about\xa0$4 billion in annual revenue. And while they may be comfortable joining a large lawsuit with other colleagues, many would no doubt shy away from standing up individually, for fear of being seen as an agitator.\nIn this particular case, the lawyers representing workers in the large collective action might consider representing workers who are forced individually into arbitration, if only because they already built the case and have a deep understanding of the claims. Yet Chipotle is fighting in court to prevent that from happening.\nThe company argued that the plaintiffs’ lawyers had no right to even inform workers of the wage theft lawsuit if those workers signed arbitration agreements. Chipotle considered that “an unequivocal invitation from Plaintiffs’ Counsel … to breach\xa0[the workers’] contract with Chipotle.” The company went a step further, asking that the plaintiffs’ lawyers be barred from representing any of those workers in arbitration proceedings ― which, in theory, would force the workers to find new counsel unfamiliar with their case.\n“Plaintiffs’ Counsel should not be permitted to capitalize on this process for their personal financial benefit or additional leverage in this case,” the company argued. \nThe judge has not yet made a decision on Chipotle’s request.\n“I think it’s basically vindictive,” Williams said. “They’re upset that these people got notice. They’re upset that they opted in. They’re upset they haven’t been kicked out of the case yet, and they blame the plaintiffs’ counsel.”\nWilliams said that if the judge doesn’t bar his team from serving their clients,\xa0they plan to represent anyone who’s booted from the lawsuit in arbitration ― even if it means taking on more than 2,800 individual cases. That could translate into a massive legal cost for Chipotle.\n“I have an obligation to these people,” Williams said. “If we are disqualified from representing them, then they truly will be without a claim.\xa0The chance of them finding a [new] lawyer to take these claims individually is slim to none.”\xa0\nAs a result of the Epic Systems decision, it’s likely that more employers will start using class-action waivers in hiring, and fewer workers will wind up in large wage-and-hour lawsuits like the one Chipotle is facing. In Williams’ estimation, “Every employer out there is going to require mandatory arbitration.”\n If that comes to pass, it would have impacts beyond workers’ ability to recoup wages they believe they are owed. Given the private nature of arbitration, it would help keep workplace problems out of the public domain where other lawyers or journalists might find them.\nIt could also take away a major incentive for employers to follow the law. Companies often change the way they do business after costly and embarrassing lawsuits. Like other large employers in low-wage industries, Chipotle counts wage-and-hour lawsuits as one of its top legal risks, for now.\n“One of the goals of a lawsuit is obviously to get money, but another is to get a company to change its behavior,” Marvit explained. “If workers went to arbitration there’s no incentive for Chipotle to change. They’re not facing a big enough threat, and they know they never will.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“Seinfeld” comedian Jason Alexander has taken a role in a hilarious new political ad bashing Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who once notoriously linked climate change to “dinosaur flatulence.”\nThe ad, featuring rival Democratic candidate and tech entrepreneur Harley Rouda, is set up as a political debate “moderated” by Alexander. “Perilous times demand action,” Alexander solemnly explains in the ad.\nRohrabacher plays himself, thanks to a series of edited clips in which he “responds” to debate questions. Alexander quips that Rohrabacher is joining the debate via a “secure server from Moscow.”\n“Asked” about climate change, Rohrabacher insists: “Global warming is a total fraud. We don’t know what those other cycles were caused by in the past. Could be dinosaur flatulence, you know, or who knows?”\nRohrabacher last year said he was just joking about the dinosaur bit when he made the statement 11 years ago, and he complained that it’s still quoted by “environmental wackos.” But he doesn’t look like he’s joking. Check out the ad above. And Rohrabacher still dismisses pollution’s link to global warming as a fraud.\nRohrabacher recently said homeowners selling their property should have a right to reject gay buyers, and he’s a proponent of improving ties with Russia.\nRohrabacher has represented the 48th Congressional District in California for 30 years, but Democrats are hoping to unseat him in November.

There’s also another GOP candidate, so it’s possible two Republican candidates could be the only ones on the ballot in the general election.\nRouda, who has the backing of the national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and rival Hans Keirstead, a stem cell biologist with the backing of the California Democratic Party, are considered the most viable candidates in the Democratic field.\n',

 {'title': 'Rhode Island Becomes Latest State To Pass New Gun Laws After Parkland',
  'body': '\nRhode Island on Friday became the latest state to join a nationwide push to strengthen gun laws, with new measures to ban bump stocks and give law enforcement additional power to temporarily seize guns from individuals determined to be an imminent danger to themselves or others.\nIn a bill signing event at the Rhode Island State House, Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) thanked lawmakers and volunteers with gun violence prevention organizations who were in attendance.\n“Because of you and your efforts, Rhode Island will be safer,” Raimondo said. “There’s no question that we need these laws, there’s no question that it’s common sense and there’s no question that it will make us safer.”\nOn Thursday, the state’s General Assembly gave overwhelming final approval to the pair of bills, sending them to Raimondo. Lawmakers have characterized the legislation as a necessary response to horrific mass shooting events over the past year.\nThe push began after an attack on a country music festival in Las Vegas in October, in which a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds more using rifles equipped with bump stocks ― accessories that allow semiautomatic firearms to simulate automatic fire.\nOnce the bump stock ban legislation\xa0goes into effect, anyone in possession of a bump stock or similar device will have 90 days to sell, destroy or “otherwise remove these items from the state.” Possession will carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, or a fine of up to $10,000.\n\n\n\n\nPaul Morigi via Getty Images\n\n\nRhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) signed a pair of new gun laws on Friday, making her state the latest to join a nationwide push for gun reform.\n\n\n\nThe impetus for the second round of legislation came in February, when a 19-year-old former student allegedly walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and opened fire with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, killing 17 people. The suspect had exhibited disturbing behavior before the shooting, but local law enforcement had no authority to seize his firearms. Supporters of the so-called red flag bill said the measure might be able to prevent exactly this sort of incident.\n“Too often, after a mass shooting we learn about all the warning signs people saw from the shooter and wonder why they still had guns. But the truth is, there isn’t always a legal means to stop them,” said Rhode Island state Sen. Maryellen Goodwin (D), one of the Senate bill’s sponsors, in a press release last week. “Our legislation provides a speedy but fair process to ensure that those who pose a legitimate risk do not remain armed.”\nRhode Island’s red flag law allows law enforcement, family members, dating partners and roommates to petition the court to have firearms temporarily removed from an individual, on the grounds that the subject poses a risk to themselves or others. A judge would then hold a hearing to review evidence and determine whether to grant the red flag petition, also known as an extreme risk protection order.\nUnder the new law, petitioners can also request a temporary extreme risk protection order, which allows for more immediate confiscation of an individual’s guns if the court determines there is sufficient evidence that the person poses an “imminent danger.” In those cases, hearings must be scheduled within 14 days of the order’s issuing to determine whether it should be extended further.\nIf a judge decides to issue a full extreme risk protection order, the subject must typically surrender their guns to law enforcement and remain away from all firearms for at least a year. Violating such an order would be a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bill also establishes a penalty of up to five years in jail and a $5,000 fine for anyone who knowingly provides false information in a red flag petition.\nRhode Island is now one of nine states with a red flag law on the books and one of four, including Florida, to have enacted new legislation since the Parkland shooting. Critics of the measures have raised concerns about the lack of due process. Gun rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island found common ground in opposing the state law, arguing that firearms shouldn’t be confiscated unless the owner is alleged to have committed a crime.\nLawmakers have introduced other bills this session to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and semiautomatic rifles commonly referred to as assault weapons. Those bills have yet to be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'The Supreme Court Just Made It A Lot Harder For You To Sue Your Employer',
  'body': '\nEmployers who stiff their workers or discriminate against them just got a big lift from the Supreme Court, which issued a major ruling Monday making it easier for companies to avoid employee lawsuits.\nThe 5-4 ruling upheld employers’ use of class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. By signing these controversial provisions, workers give up their right to band together and sue in court for back pay or damages, and are instead forced to\xa0take their disputes to arbitrators\xa0individually.\nArbitration agreements have become a common way for employers to stifle lawsuits that could lead to large plaintiff classes and big payouts. Workers backed by employee groups and labor unions challenged their employers’ use of these agreements, claiming they ran afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, which guarantees workers the right to join forces in “mutual aid and protection.”\nThe employer-friendly conservative majority on the court decided against the workers. They ruled that collective bargaining law does not supersede federal law that established the arbitration process, therefore making the class-action waivers in employment contracts legitimate.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying Congress did not write the NLRA to “displace” federal arbitration law.\n“The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,” Gorsuch wrote.\xa0\nThe high court has previously ruled that companies can force consumers into arbitration agreements with class-action waivers, which are tucked into the fine print when you buy a plane ticket or sign up for a cell phone. The latest ruling effectively sanctions the use of these waivers in the workplace, a practice that has grown increasingly common over the last two decades.\nThe Supreme Court ruling will have long-lasting implications for workers. Class-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws. \nIt’s harder to pursue these cases as a single worker than as part of a group, which is why employers prefer arbitration. Lawyers can be reluctant to file individual complaints in which the judgments or settlements will be small and not worth their time. Many workers are also hesitant to file their lawsuits as individuals, fearing their employers will ostracize or retaliate against them.\nIn a strong dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision of the majority “egregiously wrong.” She argued that the rights under the NLRA include the right to pursue litigation collectively, and that an employer-dictated waiver would violate it.\n“Employees’ rights to band together to meet their employers’ superior strength would be worth precious little if employers could condition employment on workers signing away those rights,” Ginsburg wrote.\nDuring oral arguments last year, Justice Stephen Breyer said the case could undermine “the entire heart of the New Deal” by weakening collective action by workers.\nAccording to a report last year from the Economic Policy Institute, an estimated 25 million workers ― just under one-quarter of non-union employees in the private sector ― give up their right to join class-action lawsuits as a condition of employment. The report anticipated that waivers would become an “even more widespread practice” in the event the Supreme Court sanctioned them.\n\nClass-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court case, National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., consolidated three separate cases involving different employers: the software company Epic Systems, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young, and the oil company and gas station chain Murphy Oil. \nA former Murphy Oil employee, Sheila Hobson, claimed that when she worked at one of the company’s retail stores, she and her colleagues were required to do off-the-clock work they weren’t compensated for. They got together to sue the company for back pay. But when they consulted a lawyer, they learned they couldn’t take Murphy Oil to court as a group because they had already agreed to arbitration when they accepted their jobs.\nThe National Labor Relations Board, the independent agency that enforces collective bargaining law, argued that the forced arbitration clause interfered with Hobson’s right to join together with other employees to improve their working conditions. The Obama White House agreed, filing a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Hobson.\nBut that was under former President Barack Obama. After President Donald Trump was inaugurated, his administration took the extremely rare step of reversing a previous administration’s position on a sitting case before the court. Last June, Trump’s acting solicitor general filed a new brief in support of the employers in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Unbelievably Rips Dems For Immigrant Kids Being Separated From Parents',
  'body': "\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump has bashed the Democrats for a hugely controversial policy created by his own administration: separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents.\nHe urged Americans in a Saturday morning tweet to “put pressure” on the Democrats to “end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents.”\n\n\nDespite what Trump tweeted, there is no law requiring children to be separated from their parents. The separation policy was adopted by his own administration. It was underscored in a speech in early May by Attorney General Jeff Sessions (in the video above).\n\n\n\nThe policy has been hit with a firestorm of criticism, with some even comparing the increasing dehumanization of immigrants in America as similar to the ugly atmosphere in Germany before the Holocaust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) took first lady Melania Trump to task in light of her new “Be Best” mission for children. “Separating toddlers from parents is definitely not a ‘Be Best’ policy,” he tweeted. “Are you going to do anything about it?”\n\n\n\nIn chilling Senate testimony last month, a Health and Human Services official said the government was unable to locate nearly 1,500 children who had been released from its custody. Steve Wagner, acting assistant secretary with the Administration for Children and Families of HHS, insisted that the federal agency is “not legally responsible for children” once they’re handed over to a sponsor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, families that illegally crossed the Mexican border together generally faced civil deportation proceedings. But as of May, the Trump administration is sending all parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service. Because migrant children cannot be held in jails, they are placed elsewhere by the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement. Before the Trump administration, the office handled children who crossed the border alone. \nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly, who called the harsh new policy a “technique” and a “tough deterrent,” explained earlier this month to NPR: “They’ll be sent to foster care — or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States.”\nCORRECTION:\xa0A previous version of this story identified Ted Lieu as a U.S. senator. He is a U.S. representative.\n\n",

 {'title': 'The Right-Wing Millennial Machine',
  'body': '\nAfter he graduated from college, it took Nathan two years, three unpaid internships and six bartending and retail jobs before he got his first paid gig in progressive politics. His employer was a small, millennial-focused outreach nonprofit, and his job was to supervise four interns — young kids, fresh out of school, working the same day job/night job, 80-hour-a-week cycle he had just exited. \nNathan, who wouldn’t give his real name out of fear of retaliation, asked his boss if he could start paying the interns. “I didn’t think I was going to get them federal minimum wage — that’s impossible in Washington,” he said.\xa0“But at least they could get a stipend.” \nHis boss refused, without offering much of a case for why they couldn’t afford to pay them. \n“It just wasn’t a conversation,” Nathan said. “I didn’t have the authority to push it because I was a low-level person.”\nHe felt complicit, and after a few months, he quit. He’s currently in grad school to become a teacher.\n“I had a lot of hope that my party would not be slimy,” he said.\xa0“But that felt slimy.”\nNathan’s experience is emblematic of a growing concern on the left: For a movement that wants to reach young people, low-income workers and people of color,\xa0progressive organizations and candidates don’t offer many paid opportunities. \n“This is why we see attrition in the movement,” said Maggie Thompson, executive director of Generation Progress, the youth arm of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress (which pays its interns, incidentally).\nFor decades, internships, fellowships and paid travel to conferences have acted like a tractor beam, drawing young people into political movements and holding them long enough to become researchers, strategists and candidates. But the funding to support those kinds of programs hasn’t kept up with the economic realities of the young people who today’s progressives are trying to reach. \n“The pipeline of young people who can get through school, deal with student debt and stay involved in politics has shrunk dramatically compared to previous generations,” Thompson said.\nProgressives aren’t just out of sync with their own need to recruit and retain young people. They’re also lagging behind conservative interests. A\xa02017 study found that between 2008 and 2014, conservative donors gave three times more to millennial outreach groups than liberal donors. Much of that funding, Thompson says, went to things like paid fellowships, travel stipends and study grants ― creating the feeder system that will guide young people into actual jobs with political campaigns and think tanks.\n“The Republicans are building an army, while the Democrats are still paying you in ‘making the world a better place,’” said Carlos Vera, the executive director of Pay Our Interns, a watchdog group. “I’ve had older people say to me, ‘Well, I did unpaid internships and I was fine.’ Then you ask them when that was and they say, ‘1972.’ You could work your way through college back then. That simply is not the case anymore.”\nVera spent last year calling every lawmaker in the House and Senate and asking whether they paid their interns. His report, Experience Doesn’t Pay the Bills, found that more than half of Republican senators offered paid internships, compared to fewer than a third of Democratic senators. In the House it was even worse: Twice as many Republicans as Democrats paid their interns. \nThis year, Vera has been calling nonprofits and think tanks and asking them the same thing. So far he’s found the same pattern: The Heritage Foundation,\xa0the Cato Institute and Americans for Prosperity pay their interns. The Progressive Policy Institute, Let America Vote and the Human Rights Campaign don’t.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, conservative donors gave three times more to millennial outreach groups than liberal donors.\n\nThough harder to quantify than political donations, it appears that conservatives have built a recruitment, retention and leadership development apparatus that dwarfs that of the left. The Charles Koch Institute has an “associates program” that places young professionals in conservative think tanks and pays an average of\xa0$41,000 per year. The Leadership Institute, a conservative youth organization, offers interns free accommodation, free food, an $825-per-month stipend and a $200 “book allowance.”\nThompson is on the mailing lists for several conservative youth organizations, and says they feature “nonstop travel scholarships, fellowships and opportunities.” Her progressive lists don’t offer nearly the same volume of funded positions.\nWhile some left-leaning think tanks do offer paid internships and fellowships, they tend to be less generous. EMILY’s List, for example,\xa0offers a stipend of “up to $300 per month, dependent on schedule,” but no housing. The American Civil Liberties Union\xa0tells internship applicants that “a modest stipend may be available if the student does not receive outside funding.” New America\xa0offers course credits to its interns, which means they may actually be paying to work.\xa0(Following the publication of this article, New America contacted HuffPost to say it plans to pay all future interns,\xa0and that it has always offered paid as well as unpaid internships.)\n\n\n\n\nJoshua Roberts / Reuters\n\n\nA Republican Party shirt is on display at the Conservative Political Action Conference at National Harbor, Maryland, Feb. 23, 2018.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are more deliberate about college outreach\nThe most glaring reason for the left-right youth investment gap is the sheer scale of the conservative political machine. In 2016, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute both had revenues above $75 million. The largest progressive think tank, the Center for American Progress, had just $40.9 million. \nRepublicans are also more deliberate with their outreach on college campuses. According to its 2017 tax filings, the Leadership Institute held 355 trainings for conservative students last year. In 2015, Young America’s Foundation spent $13 million on lectures, conferences, seminars and outreach — more than twice the entire budget of Young Invincibles, its rough analogue on the left. Turning Point USA, whose mission is to “identify, educate, train, and organize” college conservatives,\xa0went from $79,000 to $4.3 million in revenue in just three years.\xa0\nConservatives have also invested in youth-oriented news sources. These include the news outlet Campus Reform (sample headline: “Financial aid for illegals likely to cost NJ nearly $5M/year”), the blog Red Alert Politics (“A’s for liberal papers only: A conservative’s college experience”) and the viral video shop Prager University (“The Least Free Place in America”). They all focus almost exclusively on the dangers of political correctness and the threats to free speech on college campuses.\n\nThe Republicans are building an army, while the Democrats are still paying you in “making the world a better place.”\nCarlos Vera, executive director of Pay Our Interns\n\nAll this investment doesn’t mean, of course, that conservatives are winning the battle for millennial hearts and minds. Only 12 percent of young people considered themselves mostly or consistently conservative in a 2017 Pew poll, a 4-point drop since 2011. Progressive political organizations — as outlets like Campus Reform are always reminding us — still vastly outnumber conservative organizations on college campuses.\nBut these differences do demonstrate the structural challenge of building a left-wing talent pipeline. Progressives are spread across a huge range of groups and issues — income inequality, climate change, racial justice — and have fewer organizations explicitly dedicated to movement-building than conservatives. That makes it harder to prioritize long-term investments over short-term wins. \n“The right is focused on the long game of investing in people when they find them on a college campus,” said\xa0Stephen Kent, the spokesperson for Young Voices Advocates, a nonprofit that, among other things, helps libertarian students place op-eds in their college newspapers. “The left-leaning groups are working on whatever election is facing them in the next 12 months. Then all those connections die.”\nAmy Binder, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, and the co-author of Becoming Right: How Campuses Shape Young Conservatives, has spent the past year interviewing students at four large state schools. She sees the same trend. \n“What the right is doing is creating a cadre of potential leaders,” she said.\xa0“When they’re on campus they aren’t necessarily doing the bidding of donors, but they’re getting to know each other. They’re professionalizing and socializing students. I don’t see that happening on the left in the same way.” \nLosing talent, missing opportunities \nWhile understandable given its constraints, the left’s challenges in movement-building are making it harder to transition from winning elections to making policy. \nOne veteran progressive organizer, who didn’t want to be named out of concern for losing donors, points out that winning elections is just one component of building political power. \n“When you can’t get funding outside of that, you have to raise it elsewhere,” she said.\xa0“It’s a huge waste of time at a moment when statehouses are in session and we should be doing accountability work and getting laws passed.”\nAnd that’s not the only missed opportunity. Nearly everyone I spoke to pointed out that this has created not just a generation gap in progressive groups, but racial disparities between the voters they are trying to reach and the organizations representing them. A 2013 study found that 88 percent of nonprofit staffers and 92 percent of CEOs were white. Another, in 2016, found that only 11 percent of nonprofit staffers were under 30.\xa0\n\nThe right is focused on the long game of investing in people when they find them on a college campus.\nStephen Kent, spokesperson for Young Voices Advocates\n\n“We pride ourselves on supporting young people in our ideology, but then we don’t give them any options,” said Maxwell Love, a former president of the U.S. Student Association. He attended several left-wing political trainings as a student, he says, but there were few paid opportunities available. He’s watched many of his peers drift away from politics. \n“We’re missing people at their most formative political years,” he said.\xa0“I’m blown away by all the people in student government who seemed like they would work in progressive politics and then boom, they’re working at Oracle or they’re a business consultant. I’m not going to blame anyone for doing that, but it means we can’t hold on to talent, especially working-class folks and people of color.”\nThe long-term ripple effects of this underinvestment are already visible. The average Democrat in Congress is 59.6 years old, almost four years older than the average Republican. The GOP has 23 senators under 60, compared to just 13 Democrats. \nLove is now 27 and a Wisconsin-based organizer for Our Revolution, the continuation of the Bernie Sanders campaign. He says there’s nothing inevitable about young people remaining Democrats ― he meets many young conservatives in the course of his work. \n“Maybe this isn’t a group we have on lock,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nJoshua Roberts / Reuters\n\n\nStudents talk at CPAC, Feb. 23, 2018.\n\n\n\nThe fault in our donors\nThe lack of paid, entry-level jobs in progressive politics isn’t just the fault of Democrats or liberal organizations. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia University, says the real culprit is donors. \nHe compares the largest donor networks on the left and the right, the Democracy Alliance and the network of political organizations known as the “Koch network.” They’re similar in a lot of ways: Both pool donations from wealthy donors, vet recipients and seek to pull candidates closer to their causes. \nWhere they differ are their structures ―\xa0and their effectiveness. Hertel-Fernandez points out that since 2012, the Koch network, despite its lack of formal structure, has become more centralized and hierarchical. It gives to the favorite causes of its founders, billionaire fossil fuel moguls Charles and David Koch, and, increasingly, to organizations they control directly. Freedom Partners, one of the Koch network’s largest nonprofits, concentrates the majority of its giving on just eight organizations.\nThe Democracy Alliance, on the other hand, has moved in the opposite direction, giving smaller donations to a wider range of charities and delegating control to its members, according to Hertel-Fernandez’s research. The Democracy Alliance did not respond to a request for comment.\n“It’s hard to steer the ship of progressive donors,” Hertel-Fernandez said.\xa0“All of the folks participating in the Democracy Alliance have their own favorite issues and strategies. They come in with a set of organizations they’re enthusiastic about. In the Koch network, you’re signing up to support the Kochs’ agenda.” \nThe way this difference manifests on the ground is in the balance between united, general funding versus activity-specific and project-based funding.\nSarah Audelo, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, a consortium of youth-focused member organizations, says most of her donors want data and metrics on how their donations are spent. For some projects, they pay per door knock. That’s understandable ― who doesn’t want their donations to be spent efficiently? ― but it also means she has less room for experimentation, and less flexibility to hire staff and capitalize on the youth activism spreading across the country since 2016 on issues like immigration and gun violence. \n“Since Parkland, we’ve got tons of young people engaging,” she said.\xa0Her groups want to scale to meet the demand, but donors don’t always want to provide the resources to hire enough full-time, paid staff. \n“You can’t manage contacts and track legislation with only volunteers,” she said. “In some places, we’re literally turning away young people who are great candidates for interns and fellows because we don’t have the capacity to give them a positive experience. Progressives shouldn’t be turning away young people in states like Texas.”\nHertel-Fernandez says the strategy conservative donors have employed — get large and stay large — is part of what’s allowed conservative mobilization groups like Americans for Prosperity to mobilize so quickly around opposing Medicaid expansion, restricting public sector unions and pre-empting cities from raising the minimum wage. \n“They’ve made strategic investments,” he said.\xa0“Americans for Prosperity is organized at the local, state and national level. If you want to affect politics in the United States, you have to organize at all of those levels. They’ve moved the party further and faster to the right than progressives have moved the Democrats to the left.”\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nCharlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, laughs during a youth forum at the White House, March 22, 2018.\n\n\n\nThings are changing\nKatie Kirchner, deputy director of the Roosevelt Network ― the campus outreach arm of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank ― says progressive organizing has always been an uphill battle. \n“Conservatives are looking to reinforce existing power structures, where we’re looking to change them,” Kirchner said.\xa0“They have a strong funding edge, but they’re still losing the moral fight in the long run. Millennials are progressive.”\nShe says things are changing. Many of the largest progressive organizations have started paying their interns. The Roosevelt Institute offers a part-time fellowship that pays community college students $750 a month to organize on their own campuses. NextGen America, one of the most rapidly expanding progressive groups, is currently offering paid fellowships all over the country. Love says Our Revolution pays its interns $3,000 for the summer.\nStill, if progressive organizations want to build a movement that attracts and reflects the demographics crucial to their success, a much larger swath of them will have to offer something beyond 80-hour weeks, three-figure stipends and bartending side gigs. \nThompson says her first job in politics was knocking on doors for a living wage campaign in Minnesota. Her student aid paid her a stipend, and borrowing her parents’ Corolla allowed her to cover more ground.\xa0\n“Eventually, I got to work for Barack Obama,” she said.\xa0“But what it took at the beginning was an $1,800 stipend and an old car.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nThe mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, tore into President Donald Trump\xa0after a study\xa0released this week estimated\xa0Hurricane Maria’s death toll was at least 70 times higher than the government’s official count.\nCarmen Yulín Cruz\xa0blamed the Trump administration for not doing more to save the 4,645 people estimated by Harvard University researchers to have died as a result of last year’s historic storm. The government’s official death toll remains at 64.\n“It was about creating a narrative that made him and his administration look good,” Cruz said in\xa0an interview on Wednesday with the Latino Rebels\xa0radio program. “And many in the political class in Puerto Rico looked the other way, disregarded the truth and played into his narrative, that he gets a 10 out of a 10” for the federal response to the storm.\n“No, Mr. President ― you get 4,645 souls that were lost on your watch because the federal government that you are supposed to be in charge of was incapable of doing its job,” she said.\nThe Harvard study, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, found a lack of access to medical care was the primary cause for an increase in mortality rates in the roughly three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Sept. 20.\nResearchers said their 4,645 estimate is “likely to be conservative” and the death toll that can be tied to the hurricane may actually exceed 5,000. But the high death toll is just one of the study’s alarming revelations, such as the lingering effects of the storm on the island’s older population.\nNever forgotten! Never again! pic.twitter.com/9vym7egCid— Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) May 30, 2018\n\n\nTrump repeatedly downplayed Hurricane Maria’s disastrous toll on Puerto Rico in the months following the storm. During an October visit to the island, Trump said Hurricane Maria wasn’t a\xa0“real catastrophe”\xa0like 2005′s Hurricane Katrina, which left over 1,800 dead in the Gulf Coast area. At the time, Puerto Rico’s official death toll for Hurricane Maria was 16.\n\n“Sixteen versus literally thousands of people,” Trump said in October. “Everybody around this table and everybody watching can really be very proud of what’s been taking place in Puerto Rico.”\n\n\nDuring the same trip, he bizarrely\xa0tossed paper towels to local residents\xa0and lamented how much federal money was being spent on the disaster relief efforts.\n\n“I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack — because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that’s fine, we’ve saved a lot of lives,”\xa0Trump told local officials at an airport hangar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump faced a backlash for tossing rolls of paper towels like basketballs to people at a hurricane relief distribution center at Calvary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, last October.\n\n\n\n\nCruz had begged the federal government to increase rescue and relief efforts,\xa0accusing Trump of turning his back on fellow Americans.\n\nTrump responded by calling Cruz “nasty” and claiming her accusations were politically motivated.\xa0\n\n\n“It took too long to understand the need for an appropriate response was NOT about politics but about saving lives,” Cruz\xa0tweeted\xa0Tuesday in response to the Harvard study.\n\n\nDuring an appearance that same day on “CBS This Morning,” Cruz demanded the government be held accountable for “the negligence that allowed those lives to be lost.”\n“These people were killed by the neglect of two governments,” Cruz said. “One: the Trump administration that was very dismissive of the value of our lives. And two: those in Puerto Rico that favored political positioning rather than telling the truth.”\n“The negligence that allowed those lives to be lost, needs to be accounted for,” San Juan mayor @CarmenYulinCruz told @DavidBegnaud regarding the estimated death toll from Hurricane Maria. https://t.co/XKnNKSVYdD pic.twitter.com/1V68xUD6pT— CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) May 30, 2018\n\n\nTrump has remained noticeably silent about the Harvard study on Twitter. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said\xa0during a Wednesday press briefing\xa0that Trump “takes the situation in Puerto Rico extremely seriously.”\n“We’ve been supportive of [Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo] Rosselló’s efforts to ensure full accounting and transparency, and those who have suffered from this tragedy deserve nothing less than that,” Sanders said.\xa0\n“We’ve responded with the largest\xa0[Federal Emergency Management Agency]\xa0operation in history,” she said. “And we’re going to continue to work with the people of Puerto Rico and do everything we can to be helpful.”\nA representative for the White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for a response to Cruz’s latest comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Abruptly Cancels North Korea Summit With Kim Jong Un',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a scheduled June 12 summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after recent sparring between the two countries over the planned nuclear talks.\n“Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,” Trump wrote in a letter to Kim, which was sent to reporters.\nRead Trump’s letter (story continues below):\n Trump Letter by Anonymous FBZLGr on Scribd\nSouth Korean officials appeared blindsided by the announcement.\n“We are attempting to make sense of what, precisely, President Trump means,” said spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom, according to The Washington Post’s Anna Fifield.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-In urged both Trump and Kim to hold direct talks, South Korea’s\xa0Yonhap News Agency reported.\nIt’s also unclear whether State Department officials were aware of Trump’s decision before he released the letter. When asked if the announcement came as a surprise, a staffer in the office that works on North Korea issues said he had to check with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.\nSpeaking at the White House later Thursday, Trump said he had just spoken with military officials, as well as the leaders of South Korea and Japan. They are “ready for foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea,” he said, adding that “an unfortunate situation is forced upon us.”\n“Hopefully positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea. If they don’t, we are more ready than we have ever been before,” he said, apparently a threat of military action.\nOn a call with reporters, a senior White House official asserted that Trump “had constant communication with our allies,” but did not explain why U.S. allies were caught off guard. The official did not say whether Trump and Kim had spoken directly.\nOf the letter, the official said Trump had “dictated every word himself.”\nTrump’s announcement came hours after North Korean officials threatened to cancel the summit,\xa0angered by recent comments from Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, who compared North Korea with Libya.\n\n\n\n\nKCNA KCNA / Reuters\n\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks\xa0at a meeting in Pyongyang on May 18.\n\n\n\nNorth Korean officials view Libya as a cautionary tale and called Bolton’s remarks “awfully sinister.” After Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003, an armed revolution aided by a U.S. and NATO military intervention ousted him in 2011. Rebel forces captured and brutally killed Gaddafi during the conflict.\n“World knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fate,” a senior North Korean official said in a statement\xa0this month.\nEarlier Thursday, North Korea announced that it had destroyed tunnels at what they say is the country’s only nuclear test site. Trump did not acknowledge the concession in his letter.\nThe senior White House official said there was no way to confirm whether the tunnels had been destroyed because only a select group of foreign journalists had witnessed the process. No nuclear experts or monitors were present to inspect the site.\nCracks began to emerge in plans for the summit last week, after North Korea threatened to call off the meeting if the Trump administration demanded the country completely denuclearize. Trump appeared to soften his rhetoric\xa0toward North Korea this week, saying that a more gradual option of denuclearization was a possibility.\nBut he teased the summit’s uncertain fate.\n\n“We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting,” Trump told reporters Tuesday, without specifying what those conditions would be.\n\n\nThe next day,\xa0Trump told Fox News there was a “good chance” the summit would take place.\nTrump, in his remarks Thursday, suggested that the summit could still happen “at some later date.”\n“Hopefully everything will work out well with North Korea,” he said. “A lot of things can happen.”\nTrump had touted the renewed diplomacy with North Korea as a triumph for his administration,\xa0suggesting that he should win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.\nThe White House push for negotiations in recent months was a dramatic shift from Trump’s initial posture toward North Korea. Last year, Trump and Kim were locked in an escalating battle of insults, which included Trump threatening North Korea with “fire and fury” if the country took action against the United States.\nJessica Schulberg and Akbar Ahmed contributed reporting.\n\nThis article has been updated to include Trump’s comments and information from a call with reporters.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415675\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n          }\n\n          \n          \n          \n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(){\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\nfunction resize() {\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\n  if ((!ifr &amp;&amp; box.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; box.offsetHeight &gt; 10) || \n      (ifr &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetHeight &gt; 10)) {\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\n    label.style.display = \'\';\n  } else {\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\n  }\n}\nfor (i=0; i&lt;10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Virginia Adopts Medicaid Expansion, Promising Health Coverage To Almost 400,000',
  'body': '\nMedicaid expansion is coming to Virginia after the state’s legislature approved a bill\xa0Wednesday\xa0that would provide health coverage to as many as 400,000 low-income residents of the Old Dominion.\nThe majority-GOP\xa0General Assembly passed the measure with the votes of all Democratic legislators along with a minority of Republican lawmakers,\xa0bringing to a close the six-year debate\xa0over whether Virginia should accept funding from the Affordable Care Act\xa0to expand Medicaid.\xa0Gov.\xa0Ralph Northam\xa0(D), who campaigned in favor of Medicaid expansion last year, will sign the legislation.\n“This budget is the culmination of five years of effort to bring our taxpayer dollars home from Washington and expand Medicaid. As a doctor, I’m so proud of the significant step we’ve taken together to help Virginians get quality, affordable care,” Northam said in a news release.\xa0\nOnce the bill becomes law, Virginia will join 32 states and the District of Columbia\xa0in expanding Medicaid. Almost 400,000 Virginians may qualify for health coverage as a result, according to the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services.\xa0Benefits will become available at the beginning of next year, Northam\xa0told WTOP-FM\xa0Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\nIsabella Carapella/HuffPost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for the program’s benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 for a single person. Under the law, the federal government provides at least 90 percent of the funding for the expansion. \nThe Virginia legislation covers the state’s share of the expenses via an assessment on hospitals. The bill also reduces state spending on other programs that provide health care to uninsured people.\n“It’s a historic day. Senate Democrats have been fighting for Medicaid expansion for years,” state Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw (D) said at\xa0a news conference\xa0following Senate passage of the legislation\xa0Wednesday.\nAs written, the Affordable Care Act would have expanded Medicaid nationwide in 2014. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could refuse to enact it. To date, 18 states ― including Virginia ― had not implemented the policy, leaving 4.5 million people uninsured, according to an analysis published by the Urban Institute this month.\nThree other states may join Virginia by accepting Medicaid expansion this year. Activists in Idaho and Utah gathered enough signatures from residents to place the question on the ballot for voters to decide this November, and a campaign to do the same in Nebraska is underway. Maine voters approved a similar measure last November, but Gov. Paul LePage (R) has thus far refused to implement it.\nVirginia legislators had been at an impasse over the Medicaid expansion since the Supreme Court ruling. Former Gov. Robert McDonnell (R) opposed it, while former Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) supported it but was unable to persuade lawmakers to go along.\nThe political dynamics changed when Democrats made significant gains in last year’s House of Delegates elections. Although Republicans retain majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, the election results left them with just a one-vote margin in the House, the same they had in the Senate.\n“Elections matter. Elections have consequences,” Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) said at the Senate news conference. The entire Virginia House of Delegates and state Senate are up for election in 2019.\nAlthough Democrats are poised to succeed in their quest to expand health coverage through Medicaid in Virginia, there is a notable trade-off. The Medicaid expansion legislation also imposes work requirements on some enrollees, which is likely to result in fewer people gaining and keeping Medicaid benefits. President Donald Trump’s administration announced this year that it would permit work requirements for the program for the first time in history.\nThis article has been updated to reflect the Virginia House of Delegates vote in favor of Medicaid expansion and to include comment from Virginia Democrats.\n',

  'body': '\nPuerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, said there would be “hell to pay” if it turned out that officials from his government withheld mortality statistics for\xa0Hurricane Maria.\nOn Thursday,\xa0Rosselló talked to CNN’s Anderson Cooper about what his government is doing to count up the deaths resulting from the September 2017 hurricane and responded to the new Harvard University study about the storm’s human toll.\xa0\nPuerto Rico’s governor says there will be ‘hell to pay’ if officials withheld Hurricane Maria mortality data https://t.co/1UPw4Ce5F3 pic.twitter.com/fkBtZwvRcN— CNN (@CNN) June 1, 2018\n\n\nThe study concluded that the official death toll from the hurricane, currently set at 64, is off by a massive number: Researchers estimated the real death toll to be at least 4,645. They also said their calculation is “likely to be conservative” and the final death toll may actually exceed 5,000.\xa0\nThe researchers began by surveying several thousand households across Puerto Rico to estimate the real mortality rates in the immediate post-hurricane period. They compared those rates to the official mortality rates during the same time period the previous year to determine how many additional deaths Hurricane Maria may have caused.\nThe study said researchers had to develop the post-hurricane mortality statistics themselves because Puerto Rican officials did not release official numbers.\n\n\n\n\nRicardo Arduengo / AFP / Getty Images\n\n\nThis was the neighborhood of Juana Matos in Catano, Puerto Rico, one month after Hurricane Maria hit.\n\n\n\nRosselló\xa0told Cooper that he was “shocked” to hear this latter allegation and pointed to the executive order that he’d signed to release this information.\n“If it’s true, Anderson, there will be hell to pay, because I really want this to be very transparent,” said Rosselló. “I want the truth to come out. That’s the bottom line. And I want us to learn from this tragedy.”\nThe governor also said that his government hired George Washington University to conduct an assessment of the death toll, but those researchers have been delayed because\xa0“the best data was not available.” That report was initially due this spring.\n“We expected to have a phase-one analysis here by May 22, but, of course, data has been hard to come by with respect to that,” said Rosselló.\xa0\nThe 2018 hurricane season is officially underway and, eight months after Maria, many\xa0Puerto Ricans are still without power\xa0or reliable access to health care.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': "\nHANOI, Vietnam ― There was a time, a little over two years ago, when Ted Osius could imagine the smog clearing over this sprawling capital city, with its jungle canopy of ancient banyan trees and electrical wires alive with coal-fired power and its throngs of exhaust-coughing motorbikes.\nOsius, who abruptly resigned late last year after three years as the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, now warns that the Trump administration’s retreat on climate change is encouraging Vietnam to dig in on coal power. Doing so would undermine years of progress in a country that, with 2,026 miles of coastline on its mainland alone, risks becoming a poster child for the effects of rising sea levels.\n“The United States used to play a really useful role in influencing the Vietnamese to make good clean-energy decisions,” Osius told HuffPost this month in one of his first interviews since quitting in protest over a new White House policy to deport Vietnamese refugees.\n“Apparently the United States government no longer focuses on policy decision-making that’s influenced by sound science,” he added. “That makes it harder to make the case to other countries that they ought to make decisions based on sound science.”\nNearly a year after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords, Vietnam has effectively become a canary in the coal mine for how closely other nations will stick to the global agreement’s goals as the U.S. abandons them.\xa0\nVietnam is under pressure, attempting to balance rapidly increasing energy demands with growing concerns over climate change ― and it’s finding a generous coal-friendly patron in China.\nThe Southeast Asian country began rapidly building up its coal-fired power capacity in 2011 as it transformed itself into a manufacturing hub and outgrew its hydropower resources. Back in its first major national plan for energy development, the country had aimed to increase its coal power generation by 75,000 megawatts by 2030.\nDuring the final years of the Obama administration, however, the U.S. urged Vietnam to pursue renewable energy and cleaner-burning natural gas instead. Vietnam enthusiastically signed onto the Paris Agreement in April 2016 and since then has received roughly $40.5 million in aid from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Green Climate Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Vietnam reduced the planned construction of new coal-fired infrastructure by 20,000 megawatts and increased renewable energy projects by 14,000 megawatts. The country already operates more than 20 coal plants with a total capacity of 13,000 megawatts, accounting for one-third of the national power mix, according to a March report from Vietnam Investment Review.\nThe U.S. wasn’t the only clean-energy influence. The government faced internal pressure to shift away from coal. Last month, Khanh Ngụy Thị, founder of the Vietnamese nonprofit Green Innovation and Development Centre, won the 2018 Goldman Environmental Prize, the so-called “green Oscar,” for her work convincing state agencies to increase use of renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\nHoang Dinh Nam / Pool / Reuters\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump poses with Vietnamese\xa0President Trần Đại Quang during a welcoming ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi on Nov. 12, 2017.\n\n\n\nBut even after scaling back its plans, Vietnam was still set to triple the number of coal plants by 2030, increasing capacity to more than 55,000 megawatts. Coal power would comprise 42.6 percent of electrical production.\nNow, energy and environment experts worry that the country’s next national power development plan, which is being written this year, could hold to those figures or, worse, embrace a more aggressive coal strategy.\nThe Trump administration has offered some positive language to those pushing for clean energy. In a joint statement issued with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc last May, the White House “affirmed its assistance to Vietnam in combating climate change via concrete mitigation and adaptation measures.” The administration repeated a similar line in November, after a meeting with Vietnamese President Trần Đại Quang. The U.S. Agency for International Development is continuing to fund projects in the Mekong and Red River deltas.\nBut perhaps more significantly, the White House has proposed slashing the USAID budget by 33 percent.\n“Apparently there have been some fluctuations in funding from one year to the next,” a USAID spokesman said in an email, noting that the delta projects have continued so far. He did not respond to questions about the funding for those individual programs, and they were not itemized on the State Department’s\xa0budget justification\xa0in February.\nPresident Trump has pushed to scale back regulations on coal in the U.S. and made pitching the fuel a top priority at the annual United Nations climate conference.\xa0In one of his first moves as president,\xa0he pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multi-nation trade deal that, despite\xa0drawing criticism\xa0from environmental groups, was expected to\xa0drive down the costs\xa0of renewable energy in developing countries.\xa0Last June, he announced plans to withdraw from the Paris accord\xa0and curtailed all U.S. payments to the Green Climate Fund. This year, he named a new secretary of state: Mike Pompeo, a vigorous climate change denier who, as a congressman, made repeated attempts to cripple funding for renewable energy projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, the Trump administration seems unlikely to apply any real pressure on other countries to pursue clean energy or combat climate change.\n“When we stopped leading on climate change, that made it a heck of a lot easier for people to proceed with business-as-usual policies,” Osius said.\nFor Vietnam, that means modeling itself on China, the world’s biggest source of climate-altering pollution. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party transformed the country into one of the continent’s fastest-growing economies by following in China’s footsteps, becoming a magnet for textile, chemical and electronics manufacturing as its giant neighbor increased wages and environmental regulations.\n\nWhen we stopped leading on climate change, that made it a heck of a lot easier for people to proceed with business-as-usual policies.\nTed Osius, former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam\n\nMechanisms like the Green Climate Fund were meant to help countries such as Vietnam leapfrog the most pollution-prone stage of economic development by building up wind, solar and energy efficient infrastructure instead of coal-fired power plants ― something China did not do.\n“We are supposed to be the big counterweight to China,” said Virginia B. Foote, chief executive of Bay Global Strategies, an energy-focused government relations consultancy based in Hanoi. Now Vietnam is “just going to listen to the big bully to the north, and there’s no counter-bully to listen to at all.”\nVietnam’s energy needs are growing. The country’s industrial south suffers frequent power outages, relying on a grid so fragile that a crane operator’s accident plunged 22 of 63 provinces into darkness for 10 hours in May 2013. Vietnam’s state-owned utility, EVN, began burning more diesel\xa0to meet the country’s energy needs last year and said it would likely increase use of the fuel from 2018 to 2019.\nDespite this, the Vietnamese enjoy low energy costs, particularly in the north, where most of the country’s coal mining takes place. The average price of electricity comes to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour ― far below even that in Louisiana, the cheapest state in the U.S., where residents pay nearly 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the latest Energy Information Administration figures.\n“Politically, it’s understandable,” Foote said. “Everybody loves having cheap power, though it leads to waste and lack of incorporating clean technology.”\nThe prices in Vietnam fail to factor in the steep societal costs of increased coal burning. A 2015 Harvard University study found that 4,300 Vietnamese die prematurely each year as a result of coal pollution ― a figure that could increase to as much as 25,000 per year under a more aggressive coal buildup.\n\n\n\n\nAlexander C. Kaufman / HuffPost\n\n\nIn the crowded streets of smoggy Hanoi, a train passes very, very close by people’s homes.\n\n\n\nThe state-owned utility operates as a nationwide monopoly, forcing proposals on electricity development to navigate a labyrinthine bureaucracy.\xa0The current low rates make any tweaks to the existing model a difficult sell. The template that EVN released last year for power purchase agreements on renewable energy was panned by investors as “unbankable,”\xa0meaning it posed too much risk to private companies.\n“[F]ew reputable financiers would be likely to sign up,” Giles Cooper, co-general director of the Ho Chi Minh City-based law office Duane Morris Vietnam, wrote in a blog post in October, concluding that the “final text does little to inspire confidence.”\nOfficials at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nVietnam has, however, found a steady stream of suitors to finance its coal infrastructure. As of last December, foreign investors funded new Vietnamese coal projects to the tune of more than $16 billion. Of that, Chinese investments, funneled through that country’s biggest state-owned commercial banks, made up 50 percent, followed by Japan’s 23 percent and South Korea’s 18 percent. Vnesheconombank, a Russian financial entity, is backing the controversial Long Phu 1 power plant under construction in Soc Trang Province.\nIn February, PetroVietnam, the state-owned Vietnamese company building the Long Phu 1 plant, withdrew its application for U.S. financial support, ending what was widely seen as the first major test\xa0of whether the Trump administration would use the Export-Import Bank of the United States to support a project that exacerbated climate change.\nHanoi enjoyed just 38 days of clean air last year as air pollution surged to levels four times higher than those deemed acceptable under World Health Association guidelines, according to a January report from the Green Innovation and Development Centre. That makes Hanoi’s pollution worse than that of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and puts it close to notoriously smog-choked Beijing.\n“Now, when it comes to climate, our government’s head is in the sand,” Osius said. “That means countries are going to have to fend for themselves a lot more.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Savior Of Iraq’s Garden Of Eden Says He Knows How To Stop The Next Big War\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Shatters Records With $306 Billion In Damages From Climate-Linked Disasters\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change Is Already A Public Health Crisis, Top Medical Journal Says\n\n\n\n",

 {'title': 'Ryan Zinke Looks To Reel Back Some Critics With ‘Grand Pivot’ To Conservation',
  'body': '\nIn January, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke traveled to Las Vegas to mingle at the SHOT Show, an annual gathering of the shooting, hunting and outdoor trade industries.\xa0The people there were “all great conservationists, really good people, dedicated to the outdoors,” he said in\xa0an interview with NRA-TV.\nAn avid hunter and angler himself, Zinke has often said that the best stewards of wildlife are America’s sportsmen and -women. But after taking over the Department of the Interior in March 2017, he made quick work of angering some of those would-be supporters.\nZinke and his team focused on boosting fossil fuel production and rolling back national monument protections. And he repeatedly voiced support for budget requests that would gut federal funding for land acquisition and conservation programs.\nSeveral hunting and fishing groups that initially found a lot to like about the self-proclaimed “Teddy Roosevelt conservationist” have become outspoken critics.\nNow, after a\xa0tumultuous first year at the Interior helm, Zinke appears to be signaling a new direction.\nEarlier this month, he\xa0hosted a roundtable\xa0of more than two dozen outdoor sporting and conservation organizations to get their input on his\xa0planned reorganization\xa0of the department. He promised them a “grand pivot” away from energy development and toward species and habitat conservation,\xa0according to E&E News.\nToday I hosted a dozen+ #conservation organizations ranging from @audubonsociety and @DefendersNews to @BC_Club1887, @TheTRCP, and Simon Roosevelt. I’m looking for their input on how to reorganize @Interior for the benefit of people, wildlife & habitat pic.twitter.com/NPcQ0Y3Jji— Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) May 16, 2018\n\n\nAt the end of December,\xa0Zinke vowed\xa0to “create a conservation stewardship legacy second only to Teddy Roosevelt.”\xa0As the chief steward of America’s natural resources,\xa0he is responsible for managing some 500 million acres of land, or one-fifth of the United States, as well as protecting endangered species and managing migratory birds.\nMany conservation organizations and leaders, including the late president’s great-grandson\xa0Theodore Roosevelt IV, complained that he was falling far short of the lofty mark.\nBesides the conservation roundtable,\xa0Zinke has taken a number of steps in recent months that might reel back those groups.\nThe Interior Department made several pro-hunting announcements in the week after the conservation roundtable. It moved to scrap a 2015 rule that bans aggressive hunting tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens and swimming caribou from motorboats. It proposed expanding hunting and fishing opportunities on numerous wildlife refuges. And it named 17 members to a new panel, the Hunting and Shooting Sports Conservation Council, which will advise Zinke on wildlife and habitat conservation.\n\nWe’re going to take him at his word. He seemed sincere about it.\nWhit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership\n\nSome of those who attended this month’s roundtable are now sounding a more optimistic note about Zinke.\nWhit Fosburgh, president of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, told HuffPost last July that it was “troubling” to watch Zinke work solely on the development of natural resources\xa0“without even lip service to conservation.” Fosburgh’s nonprofit advocates for access to public lands for hunting and fishing.\nAt the roundtable, he said, the secretary acknowledged that energy was the major push in 2017 and declared that the next few years would be about conservation,\xa0departmental reorganization and tackling the maintenance backlog at national parks.\n“We’re going to take him at his word,” Fosburgh told HuffPost this week. “He seemed sincere about it.”\nFosburgh noted he is particularly pleased with a February order from Zinke that aims to improve habitat and migration corridors for big game species, including elk, antelope and mule deer.\nCollin O’Mara, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, also voiced newfound optimism after the meeting, telling E&E that his group is “committed to working with Secretary Zinke more closely on priorities like increasing America’s wildlife populations, conserving wildlife corridors and expanding outdoor recreation opportunity.” And Steve Moyer, vice president for government affairs at Trout Unlimited, told the publication he was “glad to hear of a change of direction from Mr. Zinke.”\nOther\xa0conservation-focused organizations sound more skeptical\xa0about the secretary’s proclaimed shift.\nJamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife, told HuffPost that non-game and endangered species are still missing from the conservation conversation.\xa0Zinke’s pivot, she added, seems largely geared toward rebuilding crumbling park infrastructure and reorganizing the agency.\n“I didn’t come out of [the meeting] believing that our nation’s natural resources chief steward was either enlightened or energized to conserve biodiversity,”\xa0Clark said. “Not at all.”\nZinke is mistaken, she said, if he thinks shuffling employees around will lead to more sustainable fish, wildlife and plant habitat and resources.\nIn a statement after the roundtable, David O’Neill, chief conservation officer of the National Audubon Society, said that while he appreciated the opportunity to join the discussion, the group continues to “fundamentally disagree with the Department of the Interior’s interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.”\nA little more than a week later, the National Audubon Society joined Defenders of Wildlife and other conservation groups in suing the Interior Department\xa0over its recent decision to slash protections for migratory bird species.\nThe Interior Department had announced in December that accidentally killing birds — with windmills, power lines or oil rigs — would no longer be treated as a violation of federal law. The Trump administration’s re-interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects energy companies from prosecution for these unintentional, albeit not always unpredictable, deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'New Hampshire Dug Deep Into Allegations Of Widespread Voter Fraud. It Found Very Little.',
  'body': '\nNew Hampshire election officials dug into claims there was widespread voter fraud in the state during the 2016 presidential election and found no evidence to support his claim. \nIn fact, the officials didn’t find much evidence of fraud at all.\nDonald Trump lost in New Hampshire to Hillary Clinton by\xa02,732 votes, but he said he would have won had it not been for people bused into the state to illegally cast ballots. He has offered no evidence to support that claim. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a presentation to the state’s Ballot Law Commission on Tuesday, election officials said that 6,033 of the 86,952 people who voted on Election Day did not present a photo ID and signed an affidavit that they were eligible to vote in New Hampshire, according to WMUR. Of those 6,033, the state secretary of state’s office verified that all except for 458 were legitimate voters, WMUR reported. The state attorney general investigated those 458 cases and verified they were eligible voters in all but 66 cases. \nThe data offer a significant rebuttal to one of Trump’s most specific allegations of voter fraud. Even though several studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem, Trump has repeatedly claimed that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election. He convened a federal commission in May to\xa0investigate the issue but disbanded it in January before it scrutinized much. One of the panel’s two public meetings was in New Hampshire in September, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the body’s vice chairman,\xa0said he had evidence the U.S. Senate election there was swayed by illegal votes, but New Hampshire election officials\xa0refuted his claims.\nThere’s no evidence that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, but a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 56 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of Democrats surveyed said they believe it took place. \nAnne Edwards, a New Hampshire associate attorney general, told the Ballot Law Commission that her office received complaints of buses with out-of-state licenses plates showing up at the polls in 2014 and 2016, WMUR reported. When the attorney general’s office investigated,\xa0it determined that the buses were rented from out of state but were used to transport legitimate voters to the polls.\xa0She also said the attorney general’s office has investigated 28 complaints of wrongful voting and found just five to be “founded,” according to the Associated Press.\nBradford Cook, the chairman of the Ballot Law Commission, requested the presentation from state officials because of heightened concerned about election integrity. \n“What the president said isn’t true,”\xa0he said. “People making wild and irresponsible charges about the integrity of the basic step in democracy — just because they lose an election and can’t get it through their head that people might have voted for somebody else — is destructive.”\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D) used a system called Interstate Crosscheck, run by Kobach, to compare the state’s voter rolls with those of more than two dozen other states to identify possible double voters. The system identified 94,610 people registered in New Hampshire who had the same date of birth and first and last name as a registered voter in one of the other states. When investigators looked further, they found that all but 142 ― about 0.02 percent ― were legal voters in New Hampshire, AP reported. \nGardner’s sent 51 of those cases to the attorney general for review and is waiting for more information about the rest.\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R)\xa0is weighing whether to sign a measure that would change the residency requirements for people to vote in New Hampshire. Current law reads that people may vote in the state if they intend to remain there more than in any other place “for the indefinite future.” The bill would remove that phrase from eligibility criteria — excluding, for example, short-term residents and out-of-state college students.\xa0Critics of the proposed measure say it would amount to a poll tax because anyone who met the qualifications to register to vote in the state would also have to register a vehicle there, but the bill’s Republican supporters say the current law is inconsistent and the new one wouldn’t put up obstacles to registering. \nRay Buckley, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said the data from the presentation offered evidence that a change in the law was unnecessary.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nTrump Again Falsely Insists He Would Have Won New Hampshire If Not For Voter Fraud\n\n\nAlmost Half Of Republicans Believe Millions Voted Illegally In The 2016 Election\n\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans Are Pushing Another Measure Restricting Who Can Vote\n\n\n\n',

The approval came just days before President\xa0Donald Trump announced he was working on a controversial deal to drop U.S. prohibitions against China cellphone manufacturer ZTE.\nAnother trademark was given\xa0trial approval. The trademarks grant Ivanka Trump operations exclusive rights to market a variety of products in China that could potentially amount to millions of dollars in profits. Ivanka Trump Marks LLC received approval last year for several other trademarks\xa0after she began working in the White House. Three of them were granted the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe applications for the trademarks were submitted over a year ago, and the trademark registrations were accepted May 7.

 {'title': 'Senate Advances Court Pick Who Said Planned Parenthood ‘Kills Over 150,000 Females A Year’',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― The Senate judiciary committee voted Thursday to advance U.S. District Court nominee Wendy Vitter, a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn’t tell senators about her past extreme comments on the topic.\nEvery Republican on the committee voted for Vitter, a New Orleans lawyer and President Donald Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Those GOPers were Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).\nEvery Democrat voted against Vitter.\nDuring her April confirmation hearing, Vitter, 57, repeatedly avoided saying whether she still agrees with a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans.\n“Planned Parenthood says they promote women’s health,” she said at the time, per New Orleans’ Clarion Herald. “It is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women’s health is to let them live.”\nMany of Trump’s court picks have records of being anti-abortion. Vitter, who is general counsel of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is married to former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), has been pretty upfront about her background, too.\nBut her refusal to say whether she stands by her past comments didn’t sit well with Democrats on the committee. It didn’t help that she\xa0failed to disclose that speech to the panel, along with other speeches she’s given.\nVitter also didn’t tell senators that she\xa0moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference\xa0peddling false information about the dangers of abortion ― or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms saying that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News uncovered these missing materials in March.\nOmitting details like this is a big no-no to senators on the committee, who expect a thorough submission of background materials for judicial nominees. It also at least creates the appearance of Vitter not wanting the panel to know about some of her controversial comments.\n“All I’m looking for are judges that are fair and impartial,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said in Thursday’s hearing. “They need to exhibit judgment, not to mention common sense. Ms. Vitter’s public endorsement of these obvious falsehoods... and her urging of the audience to distribute materials containing such obvious lies shows she lacks the judgment for a lifetime appointment.”\nVitter has also taken heat for not saying if she agreed with the landmark civil rights case that desegregated U.S. public schools, Brown v. Board of Education.\nHer nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been confirming Trump’s judges at a breakneck pace\xa0and has vowed to confirm every court nominee this year who makes it out of the judiciary committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nA Koch brothers-backed nonprofit is targeting one of President Donald Trump’s favorite members of Congress as part of a new ad buy slamming House members who supported a $1.3 trillion spending package earlier this year.\nThe six-figure effort from Americans for Prosperity is set to begin over Memorial Day weekend and includes direct mail, digital, radio and\xa0print ads aimed at 10 Republicans and seven Democrats.\nAmong the GOP members is Pennsylvania’s Rep. Lou Barletta,\xa0the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in November. Barletta became famous for leading a crackdown on illegal immigration while mayor of Hazleton more than a decade ago and was personally encouraged by Trump to run for the Senate.\xa0\n“It’s time to take a hard look at what lawmakers say and what they actually do when it comes to reining in overspending,” said Americans for Prosperity spokesman Bill Riggs. “The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March showed a complete disregard for fiscal responsibility. Both parties are responsible for putting the country on an unsustainable fiscal path, which is why AFP is committed to holding both parties accountable.”\nThe expansive spending package narrowly passed the House and survived a brief veto threat from the president. The goal of the new campaign is to ensure that the next spending deal includes significant cuts to government spending.\xa0\nThe Koch brothers’ expansive political network spent heavily to help the GOP win and retain control of the Senate in 2014 and 2016, and it’s highly unusual for them to attack a GOP Senate candidate in a swing state, even if most handicappers consider Barletta an underdog in November.\xa0\nFormer Koch network operatives are also\xa0ubiquitous throughout the Trump administration\xa0and the group pushed aggressively for the GOP’s tax reform plan. But the network’s leaders have become more open about their frustrations that the president and his party aren’t following the network’s libertarian-influenced policy preferences on immigration, trade and government spending. Earlier this month, the group’s Hispanic outreach arm, LIBRE, sent out mailers thanking four Democratic lawmakers for their work to protect Dreamers.\xa0\n“We will be looking for allies wherever we can find them ― on the left, the right, or in the middle,” James Davis, the executive director of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a CNN op-ed last month. “We welcome all comers. And we will hold those accountable who stand in the way of progress, regardless of their party.”\nThis isn’t to say that the network, which has spent billions to advance conservative policies and elect Republicans over the past decade, is suddenly turning bipartisan. While they’re attacking Republicans like Barletta and vulnerable Michigan Rep. Mike Bishop, for example, they’re also slamming Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz this fall, and hitting Florida Rep.\xa0Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.\nAnd they’re also spending money on ads and direct mail thanking a large group of vulnerable Republicans who voted against the spending package, including Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Jim Renacci, the GOP nominees for Senate in Tennessee and Ohio; and Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado and Rod Blum of Iowa, who are both top targets for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nOther members targeted by the campaign are GOP Reps. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, Mike Simpson of Idaho, John Carter of Texas, Robert Aderholt of Alabama, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, Tom Rooney of Florida and Ken Calvert of California, as well as Democratic Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida,\xa0Pete Visclosky of Indiana, Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania.\xa0\nThe ads are also thanking Republican Reps. Dave Brat and Tom Garrett of Virginia, Steve Pearce of New Mexico, Chris Stewart of Utah, Jason Lewis and Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Andy Harris of Maryland and Ted Budd of North Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\n\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) -\xa0North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his commitment to “complete” denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and to a planned meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday.\nIn Washington, Trump signaled that preparations for the summit with Kim were going ahead.\nMoon and Kim agreed at a surprise meeting on Saturday that a possible North Korea-U.S. summit must be held successfully, Moon told a news conference in Seoul.\n“Chairman Kim and I have agreed that the June 12 summit should be held successfully, and that our quest for the Korean peninsula’s denuclearisation and a perpetual peace regime should not be halted,” Moon said.\nThe meeting was the latest dramatic turn in a week of diplomatic ups and downs surrounding the prospects for an unprecedented summit between the United States and North Korea, and the strongest sign yet that the two Korean leaders are trying to keep the on-again off-again meeting on track.\nA statement from North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said Kim expressed “his fixed will” on the possibility of meeting Trump as previously planned.\nMoon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in a bid to keep the high-stakes U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump’s “firm will” to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.\nWhile maintaining that Kim is committed to denuclearisation, Moon acknowledged Pyongyang and Washington may have differing expectations of what that means, and he urged both sides to hold working-level talks to resolve their differences.\nIn a letter to Kim on Thursday, Trump had said he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea’s “open hostility.”\nBut on Saturday, Trump said he was still looking at a June 12 date for a summit in Singapore, adding that talks were progressing very well.\n“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”\nA White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.\nThe Trump administration is demanding that North Korea completely and irreversibly shutter its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump’s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.\n“BETTER THAN A PHONE CALL”\nMoon said he held Saturday’s impromptu meeting, the second summit between the two sides in a month, at Kim’s request.\n“Chairman Kim requested a meeting without any formality two days ago and I gladly accepted it,” Moon said, noting that the summit was in line with previous agreements for the two leaders to meet more often.\n“A meeting was held because officials of both countries thought that meeting face-to-face would be better than a phone call,” Moon said.\nTheir talks at the Panmunjom border village, which South Korean officials said lasted two hours, came after their April 27 meeting, the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade that was also held at the same venue. At that meeting, they declared they would work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War.\nThe KCNA statement said Kim and Moon agreed to hold high-level talks between their two nations on June 1, and to take steps to quickly implement their efforts to denuclearize the peninsula. KCNA said the leaders also agreed to meet frequently.\nThe agency said the two leaders had reached a “satisfactory consensus” and expressed “their stand to make joint efforts for the decentralization of the Korean peninsula.”\nMoon said while Kim is committed to denuclearisation,\xa0North Korea is not convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.\n“However, during the U.S.-South Korea summit, President Trump clearly emphasized that we may see not only the end of hostile relations but also economic cooperation if North Korea denuclearises,” Moon said. “I urge North Korea and the U.S. to confirm each other’s will by sharing their problems with each other and communicating directly.”\nA senior South Korean official later said that the two Koreas are discussing a possible non-aggression pledge and the start of peace treaty talks as a way of addressing Pyongyang’s security concerns ahead of U.S.-North Korean negotiations.\nVideo and a photo released by South Korea’s presidential Blue House on Saturday showed Kim hugging Moon and kissing him on the cheek three times as he saw Moon off after their meeting at Tongilgak, the North’s building in the truce village, which lies in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - the 2.5-mile (4 km) wide buffer that runs along the heavily armed military border.\nMoon is the only South Korean leader to have met a North Korean leader twice, both times in the DMZ, which is a symbol of the unending hostilities between the nations after the Korean War ended in 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n(Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim, Choonsik Yoo and Jeongmin Kim in SEOUL; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Agent Orange May Be Responsible For More Veteran Deaths Than The Government Is Willing To Recognize',
  'body': '\nHOUSATONIC, Mass. ― It’s been three years since Kate Naylor lost her husband, Pete, after his short battle with esophageal cancer. \nThe disease moved swiftly. Pete, a stone mason who lived in Housatonic, Massachusetts, began having difficulty swallowing in the fall of 2014. He was diagnosed just after the new year, in early January 2015. By April, he was dead at 68.\nWhen the diagnosis came, both Pete and Kate were sure they knew the cause: Pete’s exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange during his time as a helicopter crew chief in Vietnam. They quickly filed paperwork with the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, for disability payments. The federal agency sent its sympathies — but no money. Pete’s medical bills, Kate said, were covered by a combination of Medicare and insurance through Kate’s job. \nKate filed more paperwork a few months after her husband’s death for spousal compensation. But the VA told Kate that it was denying her claim because in the agency’s opinion, there is not enough evidence of a link between esophageal cancer and Agent Orange exposure.\nThe VA’s internal policies on whether to recognize a disease as related to exposure to the defoliant are based on biannual reports from the National Academy of Medicine.\xa0The academy’s 2016 report found that evidence for a link between esophageal cancer and Agent Orange is “insufficient.” \nWhile the VA acknowledges a link between exposure to Agent Orange and cancers such as Hodgkin’s disease, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, it says the evidence isn’t there for esophageal cancer and 34 other diseases that Vietnam veterans have sought to have added to the list of recognized, service-related illnesses. \nKate, 66, now lives alone with her dog, Cabernet. “Cabby” was Pete’s dog, an aging black lab that happily barks and gamely bounds to the door whenever visitors drop by. Being on her own gives Kate’s quest for compensation added urgency. \nShe has reapplied for the spousal benefit six times in the last three years, hoping the VA will reconsider its decision. The agency can go weeks or months without replying to an appeal, while sending back paperwork with a hard and fast deadline later. \nA photo of Pete hangs over Kate’s left shoulder as she sits at the kitchen table, on the red brick backsplash he built her. A pile of paperwork she’s filled in her pursuit of compensation sits before her.\n“We did everything they told us to do,” she said. “Now they have to own up to their responsibility.”\nSometimes, said Kate, it feels like “they just want you to give up.” \n\n\n\n\nKayana Szymczak for HuffPost\n\n\nPete Naylor died from esophageal cancer three years ago, and his wife Kate believes that his exposure to Agent Orange during his time as an Army helicopter pilot in Vietnam caused the cancer.\n\n\n\nPete Naylor was born on March 18, 1947, and enlisted in the Army in July 1968, at age 19. He served for nearly three years, including 11 months as a helicopter crew chief in Vietnam. Pete was honorably discharged on March 19, 1971.\nPete met his future wife, then Kate Kane, after returning home to Berkshire County in rural western Massachusetts. They were married on Oct. 4, 1975 and had two daughters, Meghan and Erin. Pete took up stone masonry, from which he retired in 2012. \nPete’s oncologist, Dr. Michael DeLeo, said in an amended death certificate that he believes his “extensive Agent Orange exposure” during his time in Vietnam is the only thing could have caused his cancer. A review of Pete’s service records confirms the exposure to the defoliant. And while Pete had been a smoker for 25 years ― a high risk factor for esophageal cancer ― he had quit 25 years before his death, and had “no history of alcohol use/abuse,” another risk factor.\n\nWe did everything they told us to do. Now they have to own up to their responsibility.\nKate Naylor\n\n“It is my medical oncology opinion,” DeLeo wrote, “that advanced aggressive squamous cell carcinoma esophagus was directly related to Agent Orange exposure, given lack of other significant risk factors noted.”\n\n\n\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_repeating_dynamic_display\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93482077\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["repeating_dynamic_display"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n          }\n\n          adSetInView(\'D\');\n          \n          \n          var args = [\'728\', \'90\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.repeating_dynamic_display\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'repeating_dynamic_display\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n\n\nOther medical professionals would hesitate to make such a strong statement. Rab Cross, a doctor with the Central Western Massachusetts Veterans Health Administration, said he could not comment specifically on Naylor’s case without all the information, but cautioned against making such definitive claims on the causes of a disease.\n“The medical opinions of doctors who aren’t familiar with the science of service connection may be well-intentioned,” Cross said. “But they’re not the kind of forensic medicine that’s needed here.”\nDeLeo’s opinion could help Kate’s case, however. In a 2007 ruling, a VA review board found\xa0that the\xa0medical opinions of three doctors who believed another veteran’s exposure to the defoliant had caused his esophageal cancer were enough to tilt the scales in favor of recognizing his widow’s claim.\n\n\n\n\nKayana Szymczak for HuffPost\n\n\nStacks of paperwork that Kate Naylor has collected in pursuit of receiving compensation from the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\n\n\nYet, the fact that review boards have ruled in widows’ favor in the past doesn’t mean it’s a guaranteed to help current cases. Review boards are not required to consider precedent decisions, meaning there are no easy answers for people attempting to navigate the VA — the whole thing is somewhat of a crapshoot.\nMany vets think the VA’s refusal to give esophageal cancer a blanket recognition is because the agency is less than enthused about the costs of adding more of them to the list.\nAlthough the 2016 study said the link between Agent Orange exposure and esophageal cancer was “inadequate or insufficient,” the report did still acknowledge research that suggested a connection between the two. The report included information from studies published in 2013 and 2014 that focused on Korean veterans of the Vietnam War (South Korea sent around 300,000 troops to the fight alongside the United States.) The studies’ authors found that veterans with a higher rate of exposure to Agent Orange were 2.49 times more likely to develop esophageal cancer than those with lower levels of exposure. \nBut the academy said that, due to gaps in the rigor of the study, such as a lack of information on the test subjects’ smoking and drinking habits and their exact levels of exposure, it would not revise its interpretation of the linkage. Other new academic studies referring to esophageal cancer and chemical exposure similar to Agent Orange published in 2013 and 2014 were mentioned in the report but deemed irrelevant due to their lack of Agent Orange specificity.\nThe National Academy of Medicine’s 2018 report, which will rely on datasets collected up until 2016, isn’t due until this fall, said spokeswoman Dana Korsen. \nThe debate over whether there are definitive links between a particular type of cancer and Agent Orange exposure has been raging for decades. The Vietnam Veterans of America nonprofit has been working to expand the VA’s list of service-related illnesses for years.\nIt’s an uphill battle, said Maynard Kaderlik, the Minnesota-based chair of the Vietnam Veterans of America’s Agent Orange and Dioxin Committee. The legacy of the defoliant will outlast its immediate victims, said Kaderlik. A veteran of the Vietnam War, he has been working on issues relating to Agent Orange exposure since 1989.\n“We have had to fight the fight for justice for what happened because of our exposure for a long time now,” said Kaderlik.\nThe VA’s resistance to adding diseases to the list of recognized conditions is part of a longstanding government pattern of dismissing soldiers from the Vietnam War, he added. \n“In 1966 they told me, ‘We will always take care of you,’” said Kaderlik. “That hasn’t happened.”\n\n\n\n\nKayana Szymczak for HuffPost\n\n\nKate Naylor holds a photo of her late husband, Pete Naylor.\xa0\n\n\n\nFred Wilcox, a former professor of writing at Ithaca College and the author of two books on Agent Orange exposure, said that much of that dismissal was related to class in the years just after the war. “These were blue-collar veterans, so the VA wasn’t listening, Congress wasn’t listening,” Wilcox said. \xa0\n\n\n\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_repeating_dynamic_display\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93482077\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["repeating_dynamic_display"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n          }\n\n          adSetInView(\'D\');\n          \n          \n          var args = [\'728\', \'90\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.repeating_dynamic_display\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'repeating_dynamic_display\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n\n\nUntil the late 1980s, the federal government claimed that the connection between the defoliant and the diseases veterans were developing was questionable at best. \nBut then Navy Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, who had personally ordered the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, delivered a report to the VA in 1990 arguing that the chemical was dangerous to everyone exposed to it — and that the government knew of the risks as far back as the 1960s. Zumwalt’s son, also named Elmo, died of lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease in 1988.\xa0The admiral believed these illnesses were the result of his son’s exposure to the defoliant during his time as a patrol boat lieutenant in Vietnam from June 1969 to August 1970.\n\nWe have had to fight the fight for justice for what happened because of our exposure for a long time now.\nMaynard Kaderlik, Vietnam Veterans of America\n\nIn 1990, Zumwalt was then-Secretary of the VA Ed Derwinski’s special assistant. Dewinski commissioned him to research and analyze the available evidence on veterans’ service-related Agent Orange exposure and illnesses for the report.\nWhat he found was explosive. Now known simply as the\xa0“Zumwalt report,” the document sent shockwaves through the political establishment.\n“Shamefully, the deception, fraud and political interference that has characterized government-sponsored studies on the health effects of exposure to Agent Orange and/or dioxin has not escaped studies ostensibly conducted by independent reviewers,” Zumwalt wrote, “a factor that has only further compounded the erroneous conclusions reached by the government.”\nThe government could ignore blue-collar veterans, but an admiral was a different story. “It was quite a moment because they couldn’t question his integrity,” said Wilcox. “And what he found was that, obviously, the veterans had been telling the truth.”\nTwenty-eight years later, the VA says not all the claims in the Zumwalt report held up to scientific scrutiny, but it was “an important initial step in examining relationships among military environmental exposure and illness,” said VA Public Affairs Officer Randy Noller.\n\n\n\n\nKayana Szymczak for HuffPost\n\n\nKate Naylor poses for a portrait in the bedroom that she shared with her husband, Pete Naylor.\n\n\n\n\xa0\nEven if the National Academy of Medicine’s forthcoming report does find definitive evidence of a link between Agent Orange and esophageal cancer, that’s no guarantee the disease will be added to the list of approved service-related illnesses. \nThough the academy’s past reports have recognized 50 diseases that fall under the “limited or suggestive” evidentiary category, the VA has only approved 14. Hypertension and bladder cancer are two examples of diseases the academy listed in its 2016 report as having some research suggesting a link with service exposure, but which the VA has thus far not added.\nIn some cases, the resistance to adding more to the list has not been the VA but rather the Office of Management and Budget. The federal agency, known as OMB, controls the VA’s purse strings and has in the past been hostile to the idea of adding costs to the budget for veterans services. In March, now-dismissed VA Secretary David Shulkin told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee that he had recommended adding a handful of conditions to the list in a request to OMB last fall, but the agency was still looking at data and reviewing financial estimates.\nThe National Veterans Legal Services Program has been working on Agent Orange cases since its founding in 1980, said Bart Stichman, the group’s executive director. In 1986, the group helped bring the case of Beverly Nehmer, the widow of a veteran who died of an Agent Orange-related disease, to court in what later became a class action suit on behalf of all Vietnam veterans.\n\nYou served your country. There shouldn’t be a category for you to get help.\nMaynard Kaderlik\n\nNehmer v. Department of Veterans Affairs, which was resolved with a consent decree in 1991, forced the VA to address its responsibilities to veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Under the terms of the decree, the VA must re-hear cases it has previously denied if the veteran’s disease is later added to the list of those officially recognized as stemming from Agent Orange exposure.\nSince the Nehmer case, the VA has paid out more than $5 billion in retroactive decisions, according to Stichman. That high cost is why many veterans advocates think the government has been so resistant to adding more diseases to the list. \n\n\n\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_repeating_dynamic_display\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93482077\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["repeating_dynamic_display"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n          }\n\n          adSetInView(\'D\');\n          \n          \n          var args = [\'728\', \'90\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.repeating_dynamic_display\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'repeating_dynamic_display\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n\n\nBut VVA’s Kaderlik argues that even having a list is too restrictive. The federal agency’s reliance on bureaucracy to determine who gets taken care of is antithetical to the stated principles of the American body politic, he said. \n“You served your country. There shouldn’t be a category for you to get help,” said Kaderlik. “Any man or woman that’s served who walks into the VA should be taken care of.”\n\n\n\n\nKayana Szymczak for HuffPost\n\n\nErin Naylor, Kate Naylor, and Meghan Naylor pose for a portrait during a visit to Pete Naylor’s grave in May 2018.\n\n\n\nIn late March, the Pittsfield Veterans Services and the local Vietnam Veterans of America chapter held an open meeting for veterans in western Massachusetts who have questions about Agent Orange exposure and navigating the VA bureaucracy. \nAbout 40 people showed up to hear the speakers. Kate was among them, hoping get some good news at last. \nBut she didn’t find an easy answer. Curtis Evans, a Boston-based claims examiner with the Veterans Benefits Administration, told the crowd that taking the initiative with the VA was essential to reaping benefits if and when policy changed. But Evans didn’t offer many options for families like the Naylors stuck navigating the system. \nAs Kate listened to the speakers, it became clear to her that she’d have to do more than just repeatedly file appeals with the VA. After Evans spoke, she made a beeline for his table outside the auditorium. The two spoke for about 10 minutes, and Evans suggested she ask for a hearing. \xa0\nIn April, she did. The VA informed her that it has received her request, and she is now waiting to hear whether she will get one.\nKate believes the fight is worth continuing. She sees the research noted in the National Academy’s last report as an encouraging sign that the science may eventually come down on their side. But bureaucracy in Washington doesn’t move fast enough for most veterans and their families.\nFor Kate, it’s about the principle of the matter. What her husband would have wanted is for the VA to take care of those who served.\xa0\nOn the anniversary of Pete’s death last month, Kate and her daughters gathered at the family home. Sitting with Meghan and Erin on the back wall Pete built from stones he collected over the years, Kate reflected on the journey so far and her hope for the future. \n“Before Peter died, and after Peter died, he was my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night,” said Kate, tearing up. \n“It’s not that I want to be some kind of a trailblazer for this cause,” she said, “but perhaps it will help or encourage other vets and their families to pursue their claims.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'LGBTQ Immigrant Detainees Reported Sexual Assault At Higher Rates',
  'body': '\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement detained transgender women in all-male facilities and locked them up on average for more than twice as long as immigrants overall, according to figures the agency provided to Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.). \nThe figures ICE shared with Rice shed light on how LGBTQ immigrants are treated in such facilities at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to dramatically expand detention ― including for asylum-seekers and LGBTQ people who may be uniquely vulnerable to sexual abuse. \nICE doesn’t publish annual reports on allegations of sexual assault or treatment of LGBTQ people within its detention centers but provided figures to Rice in response to her requests. \nSelf-identified LGBTQ people made up only about 0.14 percent of the immigrants detained last fiscal year by ICE, but accounted for more than 12 percent of the alleged victims of sexual abuse and assault, according to the figures. \nRice said she was “deeply disturbed” by the information ICE shared with her office.\xa0She and 36 other Democratic House members on Wednesday are sending a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to ask ICE to use its discretion to release more LGBTQ immigrants on parole or other alternatives to detention.\n“ICE should not be using its limited resources to detain hundreds of people who are vulnerable to abuse and pose no threat to public safety,” she said in a statement provided to HuffPost.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nICE has not yet begun to publish annual reports on sexual assault allegations in detention as required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act. The first report is under internal review and the agency plans to begin publishing relevant statistics online in the near future, a spokesperson said.\nICE received 227 reports of sexual abuse and assault in the 2017 fiscal year, 28 of them involving an LGBTQ victim, the agency told Rice. Overall, there were 467 people who disclosed being LGBTQ during intake, of the total 323,591 people detained that year, according to the figures.\nThose figures were slightly different than the ones ICE gave to HuffPost. A spokesperson said there were 237 reports of sexual abuse and assault in the 2017 fiscal year and that 26 involved an LGBTQ victim. ICE could not confirm the number of immigrants who self-identified as LGBTQ during their intake. In April, ICE told The Intercept there had been 237 allegations and that 23 involved LGBTQ victims. (A spokesperson said figures can change in ICE’s database if allegations are added or are found to be duplicates.) \n\nICE should not be using its limited resources to detain hundreds of people who are vulnerable to abuse and pose no threat to public safety.\nRep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\n\nIn each set of figures, though, self-identified LGBTQ immigrants made up a sizeable share of the total alleged victims of sexual assault in ICE detention last fiscal year ― more than 10 percent.\nICE detained 247 self-identified transgender immigrants in the 2017 fiscal year, the agency told HuffPost. And many of those individuals spent lengthy periods in detention. ICE told the congresswoman that the average length of time transgender people were detained in the 2017 fiscal year was 99 days, compared to an average of about 44 days for all immigrants, according to Rice’s office. One in eight transgender people in ICE detention during that fiscal year was placed in solitary confinement, the agency told Rice’s office.\nSome transgender immigrants were detained in facilities that did not correspond to their gender identity. Transgender women were detained in five all-male detention centers over the course of the 2017 fiscal year, along with 14 other facilities that housed only women or both genders.\nAn ICE spokesperson said that it makes decisions about where to hold detainees on a case-by-case basis, considering factors including the individual’s preference and their safety and well-being.\nBut that doesn’t seem to be happening as much as it should, said Sharita Gruberg, an associate director of the progressive Center for American Progress think tank who for years has tracked LGBTQ treatment of detained immigrants.\n“They’re detaining people regardless of the vulnerability that they face in detention,” she said. “It doesn’t seem like there is really an assessment happening ― if you are deportable and you’re arrested, you’re getting detained.”\n',

 {'title': 'Michigan’s Medicaid Bill Is A Case Study In How America Makes Racist Policy',
  'body': '\nDon’t call Mike Shirkey racist. He was just trying to help. \nThe Republican state Senator in Michigan wanted people on Medicaid to work in order to keep their benefits, but not if they live in counties with high unemployment. He thought it was ridiculous that anyone would call his plan racist.\n“I only see one race ― that’s the human race,” \xa0Shirkey said in an interview. “I can’t help… where people choose to live.”\nThe geographical exemption he pitched just so happened to correlate with racial differences in Michigan, benefiting whiter rural counties but not struggling, predominantly black cities, which tend to be located in low-unemployment counties. Shirkey didn’t think that was unfair. \n“Don’t tell me that somebody living in the city of Detroit isn’t closer to services and potential jobs in Wayne County than people living in a northern Michigan county are,” he said. “The distances from them to potential jobs are far greater and the services are far fewer.”\nAfter waves of criticism, Shirkey said last week that he’ll abandon the offending provision to avoid an “administrative nightmare.” The state Senate passed the bill last month, but the House hasn’t acted yet. \xa0\nIn defending his proposal, Shirkey seemed to be asking for an exemption of another kind: You can’t call his policy racist if it’s race-neutral in design. But his bill fits a longstanding pattern in America whereby Jim Crow policies get smuggled through the back door, under the cover of euphemism. African-Americans have been systematically shorted on government benefits since the early 20th century through policy variances that were not explicitly racist in intent but had a disparate racial impact in practice. \nTake the exclusion of farmworkers and maids from various New Deal programs in the 1930s, including the Social Security Act’s retirement insurance. Ostensibly it was too difficult to collect the needed payroll taxes from agriculture and domestic workers since they didn’t punch the clock in the same way as people in factories. \nIt just so happened that farmworkers and maids represented 65 percent of the black labor force at the time. Policymakers may not have had an identifiably racist intent, but African-American workers were disproportionately omitted from what is often called the most effective poverty-reducing program in U.S. history. \n“The exclusion of so many black Americans from the bounty of public policy, and the way in which these important, large-scale national programs were managed, launched new and potent sources of racial inequality,” Ira Katznelson, a Columbia University political historian, wrote in his 2005 book When Affirmative Action Was White. “The federal government, though seemingly race-neutral, functioned as a commanding instrument of white privilege.”\nIn an article on the decision to initially exclude farmworkers and maids that the Social Security Administration promotes on its website, public historian Larry DeWitt argued that hearing transcripts and committee reports indicate administrative difficulty was the only reason ― essentially because nobody explicitly said the goal was to exclude black people.\n“We cannot impute racism to the Social Security program on the assumption that this provision was designed to exclude from coverage African-Americans if in fact exclusion was not the purpose,” DeWitt wrote. \nThe occupational carveouts can be found throughout the laws of the New Deal. Occasionally the mask slipped, and the real purpose was laid bare. In reference to the exclusion of agricultural workers from the Fair Labor Standards Act, for instance, Rep. James Mark Wilcox (D-Fla.) insisted on maintaining wage differences between white and black workers. \n\nThere has always been a difference in the wage scale of white and colored labor. So long as Florida people are permitted to handle the matter, the delicate and perplexing problem can be adjusted; but the Federal Government knows no color line and of necessity it cannot make any distinction between the races. We may rest assured, therefore, that when we turn over to a federal bureau or board the power to fix wages, it will prescribe the same wage for the Negro that it prescribes for the white man. Now, such a plan might work in some sections of the United States but those of us who know the true situation know that it just will not work in the South. You cannot put the Negro and the white man on the same basis and get away with it.\n\nAround the time of the New Deal, Southern Democrats in Congress, a shrinking but pivotal voting bloc, also protected the racial order of the Southern status quo by insisting on state and local administration of federal programs whenever possible. While the programs themselves might not have mentioned race, their administration was left to local officials — bureaucrats, bank officers, Veterans Affairs staffers — who were more or less free to discriminate as they wished. In the early years of food assistance, for instance, state and local officials could decide whether to provide assistance in a given county. The result: black babies starving to death. \n“Many black families were denied welfare, simply because of their race,” Douglas Besharov, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, said in congressional testimony in 2015. \nBesharov recalled carrying malnourished children to hospitals during a visit to the Mississippi Delta as a civil rights worker in 1967. “I saw mothers with young children who applied for welfare being offered bus tickets to Chicago,” he said. \nStates still administer food stamps and Medicaid ― two of the biggest federal antipoverty programs ― but within much narrower federal guidelines. Republicans have consistently supported efforts to give states more leeway, a strategy that in the 1990s sharply curtailed cash welfare for single mothers. States with large African-American populations are now likelier to have stricter Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs. \nMedicaid provides health care to 70 million low-income Americans. This year, the Trump administration has invited states to submit proposals to add work requirements to the program for the first time. \nShirkey was the lead author of the proposal in Michigan. He included a carveout for people in counties with unemployment above 8.5 percent. It would have exempted residents of 17 mostly-white counties, according to one Michigan-based think tank’s analysis, but not populous cities like Detroit that have high unemployment and are mostly African-American. \nProgram administrators convinced Shirkey it would be too tricky to track unemployment and adjust exemptions on a monthly basis, he said, adding that he would have kept the proposal but for the administrative difficulty.\xa0\nThere are laws on the books now designed to address measures like Shirkey’s. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits ”procedures, criteria or methods of administration that appear neutral but have a discriminatory effect on individuals,” as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicaid, says on its website. Had Shirkey’s original bill passed, as Nicholas Bagley and Eli Savit point out in The New York Times, Michigan would’ve needed an HHS waiver that might well have fallen apart under legal scrutiny.\xa0\nIn an email, Katznelson called Shirkey’s original proposal shocking. He said that most lawmakers would probably not harbor the kind of purely racist motivations he turned up in his research on the New Deal, but that the intent doesn’t matter. \n“Consequences count irrespective of the motivation,” Katznelson wrote. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Offering No Evidence, Trump Says Mueller’s Investigators ‘Will Be Meddling’ In Midterms',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump dubiously suggested investigators from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe “will be meddling” in the upcoming midterm elections.\nTrump tweeted Tuesday that “13 Angry Democrats” assigned to the investigation plan to attempt to interfere with the elections, most of which will be held on Nov. 6. As usual, he failed to mention that Mueller himself is a lifelong Republican.\nThe 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2018\n\n\nAlthough Trump has refused to firmly accept that Russia attempted to swing the 2016 presidential election in his favor ― as confirmed by the U.S. intelligence community in January 2017 ― he tweeted with certainty that Mueller’s investigators would tamper with the midterms.\nThere is zero evidence to suggest Trump’s statement is credible.\xa0However, in February, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Russia was already attempting to meddle in the midterms. He warned that the U.S. is no more prepared now than it was before the 2016 election to prevent Russian interference.\n\n“Really, I think it’s just important to continue to say to Russia, ‘Look, if you think we don’t see what you’re doing, we do see it and you need to stop. If you don’t, you’re just going to continue to invite consequences for yourself,’” Tillerson told Fox News in February.\n“I don’t know that I would say we are better prepared, because the Russians will adapt as well,” Tillerson said. “The point is, if it’s their intention to interfere, they are going to find ways to do that. We can take steps we can take, but this is something that, once they decide they are going to do it, it’s very difficult to pre-empt it.”\nTrump has repeatedly attempted to smear the credibility of Mueller’s investigation. On Sunday, he lamented the “young and beautiful lives” supposedly “destroyed” by the “phony” Russia probe, tweeting that many of them “went back home in tatters.” It’s unclear who he was referring to in his tweet, but at least 19 people, including several of Trump’s former campaign associates, have been charged in the investigation.\nMinutes after accusing Mueller’s investigators of election meddling, Trump tweeted Tuesday that he needed to “start focusing my energy” on other issues.\n\nSorry, I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.— Donald J.

 {'title': 'Mitch McConnell Taps Anti-LGBTQ Bigot For Religious Freedom Panel',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― One of the most prominent anti-LGBTQ leaders in the country is now a federal appointee shaping U.S. policy on religious freedom, thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council ― which the Southern Poverty Law Center\xa0considers a hate group\xa0― announced Wednesday that McConnell appointed him to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. It’s a two-year term, and his responsibilities include “monitor[ing] the universal right to freedom of religion or belief abroad” and making policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state and Congress.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am grateful to Majority Leader McConnell for appointing me to this prestigious position,” Perkins said in a statement. “It is my hope that through the work of USCIRF, the world will become one step closer to recognizing the vital role religious freedom and the defense of religious minorities play in peace, security and human flourishing.”\nPerkins brings to the commission a long record of condemning and denying rights to LGBTQ people, which he and other conservatives like Vice President Mike Pence have been doing for years\xa0in the name of religious freedom.\nHe claimed\xa0in 2010 that the high suicide rate among gay teenagers is not because of societal homophobia, but because they know they are “abnormal.” That same year, Perkins described Uganda’s so-called “kill the gays” bill, which imposed the death penalty for homosexuality, as an effort to “uphold moral conduct.”\nIn 2014, he warned that an anti-Christian holocaust was imminent and said LGBTQ advocates were “going to start rolling out the boxcars to start hauling off Christians.”\nPerkins was behind an unsuccessful effort in 2016 to insert the debunked practice of “gay conversion therapy” into the Republican Party platform. He’s compared the practice to saving someone from a burning building.\nIn 2017, Perkins authored a letter signed by evangelical leaders calling on President Donald Trump to reverse Obama-era guidance allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military. He also co-authored a report with Pence\xa0in an effort to justify the ban on transgender troops.\n\n\n\n\nScott J. Ferrell via Getty Images\n\n\nHere’s Tony Perkins, second from right, with then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) in 2006, right after the House\xa0rejected a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. They were both sad about that.\n\n\n\nHere’s Perkins\xa0in 2011 describing people who advocate for LGBTQ rights: “They’re intolerant. They’re hateful. They’re vile. They’re spiteful. Our response to them should be one of love... But let me tell you what, it’s not love to be silent in the face of those who are advancing an agenda that is both destructive to our society and, more importantly, destructive to the individuals involved. To me, that is the height of hatred.”\nIn that same speech,\xa0he said LGBTQ rights advocates are “pawns” of Satan (!).\nPerkins’ record gives some insight into the kinds of recommendations he might now make to Trump regarding countries where LGBTQ people are oppressed in the name of religion.\nThe White House also just appointed evangelical activist Gary Bauer to the commission.\xa0Bauer has said that LGBTQ rights will lead to “the criminalization of Christianity,” and claimed that gay people will try to take children away from parents who don’t agree with same-sex marriage.\nLGBTQ rights groups are horrified by their appointments.\xa0\n“In their America, LGBTQ people would be forced to hide who they are or face criminal sanction, their relationships would be unrecognized, their children could be taken away and LGBTQ youth would face harmful conversion therapy,” said Human Rights Campaign spokeswoman Charlotte Clymer, who used to write about social justice issues for HuffPost’s open blog platform.\n“For the Trump-Pence White House to nominate them to this position is insulting to our core American values and ignores the reality of the vast majority of Americans who believe religious freedom and equality are not only compatible but essential in 21st Century America,” she said.\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart had no comment.\nHe indicated the\xa0office typically does not comment on appointments made directly by McConnell as opposed to those made by the full Senate.\n',

  'body': '\n\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump\xa0responded Friday to\xa0Samantha Bee’s controversial comments about his daughter\xa0Ivanka Trump, demanding that the comedian and host of “Full Frontal” be fired.\n\nWhy aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that’s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2018\n\n\n\nBee called Ivanka Trump a “feckless cunt” on Wednesday’s episode of “Full Frontal” while making a joke about how the first daughter is complicit in the president’s immigration policies.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the comment “vile and vicious” on Thursday and asked TBS and Time Warner to discipline the late-night host.\xa0\nBoth Bee and TBS later apologized for the language used.\xa0\n“I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,” Bee said in a statement sent to HuffPost. “It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.”\xa0\nTrump previously tweeted about entertainment news earlier this week when he shared his thoughts on ABC canceling Roseanne Barr’s show. Trump did not comment on Barr’s racist statement that led to the cancellation of her sitcom. Instead, he tweeted that he was disappointed he had not received a call from Bob Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, about “the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.”\xa0\xa0\nIn his tweet Friday, the president appeared to refer to the controversy over Barr’s racist remarks, calling it “a total double standard.”\nTrump publicly demanding that a private company fire an individual over comments with which he disagrees is similar to how White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\xa0suggested last year that ESPN should fire host Jemele Hill, after Hill referred to Trump as “a white supremacist.”\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ?

 {'title': 'Mike Pompeo Promises To ‘Crush’ Iran And Achieve A Better Deal',
  'body': "\nWASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday presented a lengthy list of grievances against the Iranian government and vowed to forge a new, better nuclear agreement — but he offered few details on how the United States would accomplish that goal without support from European allies, Russia or China.\n“The bet that the [2015 Iran nuclear deal] would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East and indeed for the entire world,”\xa0Pompeo said during his first major speech in his new role, promising that the new deal would address not only the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program but also its ballistic missile program, its interventions in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, and its repressive treatment of its own people.\n“We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hezbollah proxies operating around the world and crush them,” Pompeo added, referring to the Lebanese armed group that is Iran’s chief ally in the region. “Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.” \nThe original deal ― negotiated between Iran, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia ― focused only on Iran’s nuclear program, and some of its provisions would expire 10 to 15 years after it took effect. State Department officials had described Pompeo’s speech as an opportunity for the secretary to present a diplomatic roadmap to achieving a better deal with Iran two weeks after President Donald Trump announced plans to violate the\xa0international nuclear agreement by pulling out.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the secretary offered few clues about how Washington might convince Tehran to sign on to a tougher accord.\xa0Pompeo’s chief proposal ― fresh sanctions that would force the Iranians to negotiate ― depends on cooperation from Russia, China and Europe, which, unlike the U.S., do significant business with Iran. Obama administration officials spent years building a sanctions framework with those governments before attempting the nuclear diplomacy. \nPompeo repeatedly blasted President Barack Obama’s team as naive and even once suggested they actually sought to help the Iranian government. But it’s unclear how the Trump administration believes it will prove more successful than its predecessor in bringing aboard other international powers. Since Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the deal, the other countries involved in it have scrambled to ensure that Iran continues receiving economic benefits so that it will continue upholding its end of the deal, which they say is essential to global security.\n\nPompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran.\nSuzanne Maloney, a former State Department official at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe European Union has already started the process of insulating European countries from U.S. secondary sanctions, which punish companies in other countries for doing business with Iran. Russian aircraft manufacturers moved to sell planes to Iran after the Treasury Department announced it would cancel licenses that allowed Boeing and Airbus to sign deals with Iran. And China is eyeing opportunities to replace Total on a massive Iranian gas field expansion project if the French energy giant pulls out of the country under pressure from the U.S.\nThe Trump administration’s contradictory approach to Iran ― exemplified in Pompeo’s speech by his saying Tehran negotiated in bad faith and simultaneously arguing Trump wants to create a grand bargain with it ― has convinced partner governments they need to develop their own policies without looking for leadership from the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Politics email.\nHow will Trump's administration impact you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU, the closest American partner in diplomacy with Iran, has been unusually blunt in recent days. “Looking at latest decisions of @realDonaldTrump someone could even think: with friends like that who needs enemies,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council,\xa0tweeted last week.\nPompeo attempted to downplay the rift. “From my conversations with Europeans friends, I know that they broadly share these same views, of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community,” he said.\xa0\nHours after Pompeo’s remarks, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal.\n“There is no alternative to the JCPOA,”\xa0Mogherini said in a statement, referring to the Iran deal’s official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\xa0“Secretary Pompeo’s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the JCPOA has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence Iran’s conduct in areas outside the scope of JCPOA.”\xa0\nPompeo\xa0 — like hawkish national security adviser\xa0John Bolton — has warned that the Trump administration would be willing to punish European businesses dealing with Iran.\nThe Europeans have already been burned by the U.S. Over the past several months, the State Department’s director of policy planning, Brian Hook, led negotiations with U.S. allies aimed at creating parallel agreements to supplement the 2015 nuclear accord, part of an effort to entice Trump to stay in the deal. State Department officials say they were close to reaching an agreement — but Trump seemed to have not even known about the effort.\nDuring his speech on Monday, Pompeo specifically referenced cooperating with the few American partner governments who praised Trump’s Iran deal decision: Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Some of them and other pro-U.S. nations like Qatar have supported the Trump administration’s anti-Iran actions since the announcement on the deal,\xa0including\xa0placing new sanctions on Iran-linked figures and entities.\nBut it’s unclear how far Gulf countries will go to pressure the Islamic Republic, particularly if Europe, Russia and China try to sustain significant international economic activity with Iran. The UAE and Qatar have their own strong economic ties to Iran, and officials around the region are wary of sparking fresh tensions between the few remaining stable governments there.\nPompeo tried to justify his case by repeatedly referencing the plight of ordinary people: Iranians themselves, Middle Easterners at risk from Iranian-backed Houthi and Hamas militants and Syrians suffering because of Iran’s support for the brutal Assad regime. (In Trump-era style, he both spoke of Syrians as victims and then repeated the misleading populist argument that Syrian refugees flowing into Europe include many terrorists.)\xa0\nYet so far, the effects of Trump’s decision are hitting the individuals Pompeo mentioned the hardest ― making it more difficult for Iranians\xa0to buy vital goods\xa0and for U.S. officials to use diplomacy\xa0to help the American prisoners held in Iran.\xa0\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran will likely only grow in the months ahead as hard-liners there gain power by pushing the narrative that the West cannot be trusted and the Trump administration continues to try and look tough.\nExperts who watched Pompeo’s speech called his demands unrealistic and some\xa0predicted\xa0that when Iran inevitably fails to meet them, the U.S. will use it as justification for military intervention.\n“Pompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran,” tweeted Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department official during the George W. Bush administration.\nThis article has been updated to include comment from Federica Mogherini.\n",

  'body': '\nSome Florida shoppers are vowing to boycott grocery store Publix ahead of the busy Memorial Day weekend after the regional chain donated more than a half-million dollars to a gubernatorial candidate who touts himself as a “proud NRA sellout.”\nEarlier this month, local media first revealed\xa0the grocer’s $670,000 in donations over the last three years to Republican candidate Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner.\nPutnam, who brands himself as a lifelong gun owner, opposed Gov. Rick Scott’s (R) gun control law signed in the wake of February’s deadly mass shooting\xa0at a Parkland, Florida, high school.\nPutnam had said Scott’s decision to raise the age to purchase a rifle or a shotgun from 18 to 21\xa0“destroys the family tradition of possessing and practicing safe use of firearms.” The National Rifle Association, which immediately sued to block the gun law, applauded Putnam’s stance.\nPublix is Florida’s largest private employer, according to The Tampa Bay Times, and its political donations to Putnam are likely some of the largest since 1995, if not in the company’s history.\xa0\nNow the\xa0#BoycottPublix petition\xa0has spread across social media.\nNo, @Publix.

He is bad for Florida and our Everglades! #tweetthereceipt #BoycottPublix pic.twitter.com/Vqev8Eavhq— MeliMel (@blondie904) May 22, 2018\n\n\nPublix defended\xa0itself, saying it never made any direct donations to the NRA, which has called for more guns in the wake of what many are calling a gun violence epidemic. Including last week’s deadly shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school, there have been 16 school shootings this year,\xa0according to a count by The Washington Post.\nPublix said in a statement to HuffPost Tuesday evening that the company has a “history of supporting candidates focused on job growth and a healthy Florida economy.”\n“We regret that some of our political contributions have led to an unintentional customer divide instead of our desire to support a growing economy in Florida,” the company said.\xa0“As a result of this situation, we are evaluating our processes to ensure that our giving better reflects our intended desire to support a strong economy and a healthy community.”\nThose vowing to boycott Publix have argued that supporting Putnam directly supports the NRA because of his promise to uphold the group’s beliefs.\n“I’m very sad I’ll never experience the joy of a [Publix sub] again but nothing tastes as good as being on the right side of the fight,” tweeted social media user Gabriella Juliet,\xa0who used the boycott hashtag.\nWhether the boycott will affect the company ― which has 1,183 stores in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia ― remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\nNicolasMcComber via Getty Images\n\n\nPublix, which has over 1,000 stores across the southeast, has donated more than a half a million dollars to gubernatorial candidate and current agricultural commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\n\n\nAccording to personal finance website WalletHub, 60 percent of Americans plan to barbecue over the Memorial Day weekend, with $1.5 billion worth of meat and seafood being purchased for the event. Memorial Day is also the second most popular day for beer sales, just behind Independence Day.\nDavid Jenkins, a Tampa resident who said he is participating in the boycott, estimated to the Times that he spends $500 to $600 a month at Publix stores. He said he’s now taking his business to competitor Winn-Dixie.\n“I’m sure if you went through every corporate chain you could find something you disagree with, but there’s a certain point where you draw a line,” he told the paper. “This situation — where the amount of money is so substantial and the stakes so high — is the line.”\n\n\n\n\nJoe Skipper / Reuters\n\n\nAdam Putnam, who has called himself an “NRA sellout,” opposed a state-wide gun control law that was passed in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting.\n\n\n\nPublix has financially supported Putnam as a political candidate since at least 1995, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\nPublix has explained its support for Putnam as him being a “hometown candidate” from Polk County, where the company was founded, and having “a long-standing relationship” with the grocer.\nThe Times reported that in 2016, during his second term as commissioner of agriculture, Putnam once pulled the results of failed health inspections of seven Publix stores from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’s website. He then eliminated the pass/fail grading system and made it so the worst rating possible is “re-inspection required.”\nFlorida’s primary elections are on Aug. 28. The state’s gubernatorial election is on Nov. 6.\nPutnam’s challengers include U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.\xa0The Democratic candidates are former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, and Central Florida businessman Chris King.\nThis article has been updated to include a statement from Publix.\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nWhy More Than 90 Percent Of Gun Owners Don’t Join The NRA\n\n\nFlorida Gov.

 {'title': 'Trump’s Crackdown On Immigrant Parents Puts More Kids In An Already Strained System',
  'body': '\nTens of thousands of children from Central America are apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border each year, straining the government system caring for minors traveling to the U.S. without their parents. Now Donald Trump’s administration is stretching the system even further. \nUntil recently, families that illegally crossed together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But as of\xa0this month, the Trump administration is following a blanket policy of referring for prosecution all people who cross illegally. The change means that authorities send parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Services\xa0and\xa0their children wind up in the same agency as minors who came to the U.S. without their parents ― sometimes without their parents being able to locate them. \nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly told NPR this month that once separated from their parents, children “will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever.” \nThat “whatever” is the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes custody of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, who by law may not be immediately deported. The ORR is charged with finding a sponsor for the children to live with ― ideally, a parent. \nEven before Trump administration officials announced the new policy, the ORR was showing signs of strain. \nWhile the number of children apprehended while traveling without their parents is lower than it was at its peak in 2014, border agents picked up more than 26,000 unaccompanied minors since October. The ORR recently lost track of nearly 1,500 children once in its custody and in 2014 released some minors to traffickers. \n“They’re crippling an already overwhelmed system,” Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, said of the administration’s decision. “You take that situation in which children are released, and then there’s little to no follow-up, and add hundreds and hundreds of children ― thousands of children, eventually ― and you’re multiplying the level of the problem.” \nLast month Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families, which includes the ORR, told a Senate subcommittee that the federal government was unable to locate 1,475 children who had been released from its custody when it called to check in on them from October the end of 2017. An additional 28 had run away, and 52 were living with someone other than their initial sponsor, he said. \nOnce an unaccompanied minor is placed with a sponsor, “he or she ceases to be in the custody of the U.S. government, and all HHS-provided subsistence\xa0— food, shelter, clothing, health care and education —\xa0ends at that point, and the child becomes the responsibility of his or her parent, guardian or sponsor,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement. \nThe ORR typically calls to check in with sponsors 30 days after releasing a child, but that’s it. The children have little in the way of other help; the government does not provide immigrants with attorneys for removal proceedings, even if they’re children, leaving them to navigate a complicated legal process on their own.\n\nThis is as horrific a policy as I’ve seen in 25-plus years doing civil rights work.\nLee Gelerent, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project\n\nThe ORR has already come under scrutiny from some members of Congress, particularly after it was revealed that it released several minors in 2014 to sponsors who ended up being traffickers. HHS and the Department of Homeland Security were supposed to have a joint plan for dealing with unaccompanied minors by February 2017 but failed to meet their deadline. The agencies told the Senate’s permanent subcommittee on investigations last month that they would complete their plan by July 30, according to the office of Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who chairs the subcommittee and has pressed for quicker action. \nNow the government could be facing an influx of children, many of them likely to be younger than the average age of minors who traveled without parents. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is taking steps that could deter some sponsors from coming forward to take in children. The ORR previously checked fingerprints of potential sponsors to conduct background checks,\xa0and now it has a memorandum of understanding to share that information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which could have a chilling effect for undocumented parents already in the U.S. whose children came to join them. \nParents in government custody are now in many cases unable to locate their children. After the parents serve time for the misdemeanor offense of illegal entry ― typically a sentence of only a few days and often no more than time served ― they’re then transferred to ICE for deportation. With limited access to phones and no right to a public defender, parents might not be able to find out where their children are. \nThe ORR worked with the DHS to locate parents in immigration custody in about 700 cases since October 2017, according to an ORR spokesperson. \nEven before the Trump administration concretized the immigration changes this month, family separation at the border sparked legal challenges. In February the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed at a port of entry with her daughter. The two were separated despite crossing legally. The ACLU is asking a federal judge to issue a nationwide injunction barring the federal government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause. \n“This is as horrific a policy as I’ve seen in 25-plus years doing civil rights work,” Lee Gelerent, an attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project, told HuffPost. “No child should be sent to these government facilities if they don’t have to be, especially with all these problems in the ORR system.”\nThose cases are now becoming more common. At a recent immigration prosecution hearing in Tucson, Arizona, a 36-year-old Guatemalan woman named Alma Jacinto asked through her assigned lawyer when she could be reunited with her two children, who were separated from her when they crossed the border. Neither the magistrate judge nor the prosecutor knew the answer. \nIn another case, reported by the Houston Chronicle, Esteban Pastor was deported to Guatemala after U.S. authorities separated him from his 18-month-old child. He was unable to locate the child after he returned to Guatemala. \n“God only knows how many of the kids will get reunited or how they will be reunited when the parents are prosecuted,” said Judy Greene, a\xa0co-author of Indefensible: A Decade of Mass Incarceration of Migrants Prosecuted for Crossing the Border. “This is devastating.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump just got one more reason not to visit this Southern California city.\nWest Hollywood ― which has continuously gone out of its way to denounce Trump ― presented adult film star Stormy Daniels with the key to the city on Wednesday while proclaiming the day “Stormy Daniels Day.”\n\n\n\n\nMike Blake/Reuters\n\n\nAdult film star Stormy Daniels received\xa0a key\xa0to West Hollywood, California, on Wednesday for\xa0taking on President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\n\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was honored for “her leadership in the #RESIST movement” ― in particular for being a “national figure in the resistance to the Trump Administration,” the city said in a statement.\n“In these politically tumultuous times, Daniels has proven herself to be a profile in courage by speaking truth to power even under threats to her safety and extreme intimidation,” the statement read.\n\n\n\n\nMike Blake/Reuters\n\n\nStormy Daniels\xa0stands next to West Hollywood Mayor John J. Duran after receiving a key to the city on May 23, 2018.\n\n\n\nThe 39-year-old actress and director, who was recognized at the Santa Monica Boulevard sex shop Chi Chi LaRue’s, won national fame after alleging that she’d had an affair with Trump in 2006. Daniels has continued to tell her story, though she said\xa0someone threatened her over it.\nIn a tweet leading up to Wednesday’s event, West Hollywood Mayor John Duran shared that “right-wing hate mail is pouring in” over his city’s decision to recognize Daniels. It “tells me I am doing something right!” he tweeted.\nHaha! Giving the key to the City to @StormyDaniels today & the right wing hate mail is pouring in. Been doing LGBT rights for over 30 years.

In 2016, its then-Mayor Lindsey Horvath wrote a letter to the then-presidential candidate, informing him that his “campaign of violence and intimidation is not welcome in our city.”\n“I demand that you renounce calls to violence and consider the role you play in shaping public discourse, specifically with the words you choose and the behavior you exhibit and encourage,” Horvath stated. “We do not have to agree or like one another, but as Americans and political figures in the public eye, we share a responsibility to lead by example.”\nIn June 2017,\xa0West Hollywood’s City Council also passed a resolution that called on the U.S. House of Representatives to begin initiating Trump’s impeachment. The resolution cited a number of reasons, including his revenue from his businesses both in the U.S. and abroad; his refusal to release his tax returns; nepotism; concerns about collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice with the firing of former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nTrump Blocking People On Twitter Is Unconstitutional, Judge Rules\n\n\nStormy Daniels Has An Actress Doppelgänger\n\n\nStormy Daniels Reveals Sketch Of Man Who Allegedly Threatened Her Over Trump Story\n\n\nDon’t Underestimate Stormy Daniels\n\n\nDiamond And Silk Appear To Lie Under Oath About Trump Payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'First Congress Took Sex Workers’ Websites. Now It’s Coming For Their Bank Accounts.',
  'body': '\nA new law that shuttered websites used by voluntary sex workers to screen clients has already forced\xa0some to risk their lives by returning to the streets to find business. \nBut the broad bipartisan alliance that passed that legislation last month isn’t done. Now, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who both voted for the first bill, are pushing a proposal in the Senate that would impose similar restrictions on sex workers’ bank accounts — a move that sex workers say could further endanger their income, safety and lives.\nJust like last month’s Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, Warren and Rubio’s End Banking for Human Traffickers Act is intended to crack down on human trafficking. The bill, which passed the House in overwhelming fashion last month, would increase pressure on banks to shut down the accounts of anyone suspected of engaging in trafficking. Besides Warren, five other Senate Democrats are co-sponsoring the bill; a Senate vote is not yet scheduled.\n“Human trafficking generates $150 billion a year in illegal profits,” a representative for Warren told HuffPost. “Our bill would connect federal regulators, law enforcement, and the banking industry to help strengthen existing anti-money-laundering efforts that combat traffickers — Congress should pass it.”\nThe bill doesn’t put the same restrictions on the banking industry that last month’s bill applied to websites. But by increasing the federal government’s focus on sex trafficking ― including by adding the Secretary of the Treasury to an existing task force on the subject ― it could, some sex workers fear, cause already jittery financial institutions to crack down harder on a vulnerable population’s access to financial services.\nGiven the frequency with which sex trafficking and voluntary, consensual sex work are conflated, sex workers including webcam performers, adult film actors and business owners, strippers and escorts fear these efforts will hit them too.\n“What a lot of organizers are worried about is how these broad anti-trafficking initiatives are often applied in a targeted manner that hurts more vulnerable people rather than helps them,” Liara Roux, a sex worker and producer of independent adult media, told HuffPost. “If this bill is passed in a climate where sex work is so stigmatized that no distinction is made between a trafficked individual and someone who is just trying to survive, you’re just as likely to see vulnerable people’s bank accounts closed as actual traffickers caught.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHECTOR RETAMAL via Getty Images\n\n\nOne sex worker told HuffPost that Bank of America closed her account for “suspicious activity” — specifically her line of work.\n\n\n\nSex workers already have trouble finding financial institutions that will accept their money. Banks are often reluctant to discuss their decisions to close accounts\xa0and aren’t legally required to explain them. In 2014, JPMorgan Chase closed the bank accounts of several adult film actors without telling them why. And between 2013 and 2017, some sex workers also got caught up in Operation Choke Point — a 2013 initiative by President Barack Obama to discourage banks from working with payday lenders and gun retailers. As part of the initiative, which the Trump administration scrapped last August, industries like pornography and dating services were listed as “high risk” — a designation that pushed banks to shut down accounts tied to those industries.\nRoux said her bank stonewalled her just a couple years ago, despite her good standing. “It just doesn’t matter how well-behaved you are to a banking institution when they consider your account a risk,” she said. \nBut Warren and Rubio’s bill will cause banks to shut down voluntary sex workers’ accounts more frequently and indiscriminately, sex workers worry. The new banking bill could help push voluntary sex work further underground, warned Lola Davina, a former sex worker who is now a writer and activist.\n“A criminal enterprise hardened enough to traffic sex will have no compunction driving their business practices even further underground, moving money and advertising to the dark web, while leaving voluntary workers with no legal protections to conduct their affairs,” she said. \nA representative for Warren declined to comment when asked directly about the effects the banking proposal would have on voluntary sex workers. Rubio did not respond to requests for comment. \nIt’s hard to see the benefit of updating labor and trafficking-related policy without consulting with the affected members of those industries and communities, said Victoria Bateman, professor of economics at Cambridge University. \n“If the regulation of any other sector of the economy was under the lens in an effort to improve the lives of those involved, wouldn’t workers be the first to be consulted?” Bateman said by email. “And, if we were trying to tackle human trafficking in any other sector of the economy (e.g. in agriculture or home help), would we really enact measures that threatened the lives of those who voluntarily work in agriculture or as cleaners in other people’s homes — and without speaking to them first?” \nDespite potentially drastic consequences, the banking bill has inspired far less public opposition than did last month’s bill on online platforms.\nThat’s partly because the legislation that affected Craigslist and Backpage drew opposition from sex workers and internet freedom activists alike. Groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation ran several campaigns opposing it. Given that this new legislation isn’t related to online free speech, it’s less alarming for people outside of the sex work community. \nThis time around, sex workers are using Twitter to warn each other about which banks they should avoid.\nEven without the bill becoming law, some banks continue to make it hard for sex workers to access their money. One sex worker, Bianca Baker, told HuffPost that her account with Bank of America was shut down earlier this month. When she tried to use her debit card for a purchase, it was declined despite the thousands of dollars she had in her account. After several phone calls and in-person visits to her bank, she was told that her account was shut down for “suspicious activity” and, eventually, that it was because she was a sex worker.\n“I had 13,000 dollars frozen for 48 hours,” Baker, who’s married and has a child, told HuffPost via chat. “It was so stressful. I love my job; I work so hard to provide for my family and this is what I get.”\nBank of America declined to comment.\n“This should not have happened to me,” Baker added. With the help of a sex worker-friendly lawyer, she was eventually able to recover her money. She even found a sex worker-friendly bank. But if Rubio and Warren’s bill passes, she worries, she might have to take her money out of the banking system entirely. \n“Do not be afraid to get a lawyer and ask for legal advice,” she warns her colleagues. “I encourage all sex workers to stay safe. It’s very scary right now.”\nThis article has been updated to highlight that the bill wouldn’t put the same restrictions on the banking industry that FOSTA applied to online platforms.\xa0However, sex workers have expressed fear that it may pressure financial institutions to limit access for them.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n‘This Bill Is Killing Us’: 9 Sex Workers On Their Lives In The Wake Of FOSTA\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Signs Controversial Bill Targeting Online Sex Trafficking\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Questions Sex Workers Hear All The Time\n\n\n\n',

If I ask you some names, can you tell who the great beauties are?’”\nStern was amazed by Trump’s reasoning.\n“He goes, first of all ― straight face ― the great beauties, Howard, are not actresses,” Stern continues. “It’s models ... Anyone works in the entertainment industry, really, I’ve only seen sixes and sevens.”\nStern was also surprised at who Trump thought was hot.\n“I’d say... ‘I think Angelina Jolie is a great beauty.’ ‘Seven!’ ‘Really, why?’... He goes, ‘You know who’s a great beauty?’ I go, ‘Who?’ ‘My daughter Ivanka. Now she’s a 10.’”\nAs you can see in the video below, Letterman clearly cringes at that point in the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'LGBTQ Immigrant Detainees Reported Sexual Assault At Higher Rates',
  'body': '\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement detained transgender women in all-male facilities and locked them up on average for more than twice as long as immigrants overall, according to figures the agency provided to Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.). \nThe figures ICE shared with Rice shed light on how LGBTQ immigrants are treated in such facilities at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to dramatically expand detention ― including for asylum-seekers and LGBTQ people who may be uniquely vulnerable to sexual abuse. \nICE doesn’t publish annual reports on allegations of sexual assault or treatment of LGBTQ people within its detention centers but provided figures to Rice in response to her requests. \nSelf-identified LGBTQ people made up only about 0.14 percent of the immigrants detained last fiscal year by ICE, but accounted for more than 12 percent of the alleged victims of sexual abuse and assault, according to the figures. \nRice said she was “deeply disturbed” by the information ICE shared with her office.\xa0She and 36 other Democratic House members on Wednesday are sending a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to ask ICE to use its discretion to release more LGBTQ immigrants on parole or other alternatives to detention.\n“ICE should not be using its limited resources to detain hundreds of people who are vulnerable to abuse and pose no threat to public safety,” she said in a statement provided to HuffPost.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nICE has not yet begun to publish annual reports on sexual assault allegations in detention as required by the Prison Rape Elimination Act. The first report is under internal review and the agency plans to begin publishing relevant statistics online in the near future, a spokesperson said.\nICE received 227 reports of sexual abuse and assault in the 2017 fiscal year, 28 of them involving an LGBTQ victim, the agency told Rice. Overall, there were 467 people who disclosed being LGBTQ during intake, of the total 323,591 people detained that year, according to the figures.\nThose figures were slightly different than the ones ICE gave to HuffPost. A spokesperson said there were 237 reports of sexual abuse and assault in the 2017 fiscal year and that 26 involved an LGBTQ victim. ICE could not confirm the number of immigrants who self-identified as LGBTQ during their intake. In April, ICE told The Intercept there had been 237 allegations and that 23 involved LGBTQ victims. (A spokesperson said figures can change in ICE’s database if allegations are added or are found to be duplicates.) \n\nICE should not be using its limited resources to detain hundreds of people who are vulnerable to abuse and pose no threat to public safety.\nRep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.)\n\nIn each set of figures, though, self-identified LGBTQ immigrants made up a sizeable share of the total alleged victims of sexual assault in ICE detention last fiscal year ― more than 10 percent.\nICE detained 247 self-identified transgender immigrants in the 2017 fiscal year, the agency told HuffPost. And many of those individuals spent lengthy periods in detention. ICE told the congresswoman that the average length of time transgender people were detained in the 2017 fiscal year was 99 days, compared to an average of about 44 days for all immigrants, according to Rice’s office. One in eight transgender people in ICE detention during that fiscal year was placed in solitary confinement, the agency told Rice’s office.\nSome transgender immigrants were detained in facilities that did not correspond to their gender identity. Transgender women were detained in five all-male detention centers over the course of the 2017 fiscal year, along with 14 other facilities that housed only women or both genders.\nAn ICE spokesperson said that it makes decisions about where to hold detainees on a case-by-case basis, considering factors including the individual’s preference and their safety and well-being.\nBut that doesn’t seem to be happening as much as it should, said Sharita Gruberg, an associate director of the progressive Center for American Progress think tank who for years has tracked LGBTQ treatment of detained immigrants.\n“They’re detaining people regardless of the vulnerability that they face in detention,” she said. “It doesn’t seem like there is really an assessment happening ― if you are deportable and you’re arrested, you’re getting detained.”\n',

  'body': '\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday proposed rolling back a 2015 rule that bans aggressive predator control tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens ― a move immediately blasted by environmental groups.\xa0\nThe\xa0proposal, slated to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, would amend the National Park Service’s current regulations to again allow for controversial sport hunting and trapping techniques on roughly 20 million acres of federal lands in Alaska. The park service, part of the Department of the Interior,\xa0said lifting the prohibitions would increase hunting opportunities on national preserve land,\xa0as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called for in a pair of secretarial\xa0orders last year.\xa0\nThe proposed rule would allow hunters to lure brown and black bears with bait, hunt black bears and their cubs using artificial lights,\xa0shoot bear cubs and wolf and coyote pups in their dens,\xa0and use dogs to hunt black bears. It would also allow hunters to shoot swimming caribou from motorboats.\xa0\n\nAllowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric and inhumane.\nJamie Rappaport Clark, Defenders of Wildlife president and CEO\n\nEnvironmental groups voiced disgust at the attempt to strip away protections.\xa0\n“I’m outraged that [President Donald] Trump and his trophy-hunting cronies are promoting the senseless slaughter of Alaska’s most iconic wildlife,” said Collette Adkins, a lawyer and biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Cruel and harmful hunting methods like killing bear cubs and their mothers near dens have no place on our national preserves.”\nDefenders of Wildlife said the 2015 park service rule prevented “extreme methods of killing predators.”\n“The Trump administration has somehow reached a new low in protecting wildlife,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, the nonprofit’s president and CEO. “Allowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric and inhumane. The proposed regulations cast aside the very purpose of national parks to protect wildlife and wild places.”\nThe park service said in an emailed statement the proposed rule would “establish consistency” with state regulations.\xa0\n“The conservation of wildlife and habitat for future generations is a goal we share with Alaska,” agency regional director Bert Frost said.\nA 60-day public comment period begins Tuesday.\xa0\nThe proposal comes a little more than a year after Congress\xa0approved a measure to repeal an Obama-era rule that largely banned hunting of Alaska’s most iconic predators in Alaska’s national wildlife refuges. The Republican-sponsored legislation opened the door for the state to resume aggressive predator control tactics, including shooting bears and wolves from airplanes, on more than 76 million acres of refuge land.\xa0\nTrump signed that bill into law in April 2017.\nFor more information about the National Park Service’s proposal or to submit public comments, visit\xa0www.regulations.gov\xa0and search for “RIN 1024-AE38.”\n',

Life is not that simple.”\nSnowden, speaking from Moscow, said he also doesn’t believe Trump is the kind of crack double operator Putin would rely on.\n“To be honest, everyone who has heard Trump speak for three minutes knows he’s a wrecking ball,” he said. “This does not sound like the kind of person that you would want to engage in some kind of complicated ‘Manchurian Candidate’” spy operation, when “the guy can’t even remember what he’s going to say at the end of a sentence.”\n“That doesn’t mean that he didn’t want to cooperate,” Snowden added. “That doesn’t mean he wouldn’t do anything to achieve an advantage.”\nSnowden encouraged people — including would-be leakers in the U.S. government — to continue to struggle for change.\n“I believe that this world can be better. I believe that this world should be better. But it’s not going to get better unless we make it better,” he said. “And that requires risk. That requires hard work. That ultimately might require sacrifice.”\n“Things change,” he went on. “If they can change for the worse, they can change for the better. If more good people are organizing... if we’re willing to draw lines that we will not allow people to cross without moving us out of the way, the pendulum will swing.”\nCheck out the entire podcast here.\nCORRECTION:\xa0A previous version of this story indicated Snowden faces treason charges in the U.S. In fact, he has been charged with espionage.\n',

  'body': '\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump’s lawyer flatly admitted that the White House is waging a fierce information campaign against special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nThe aim: to delegitimize the probe in the eyes of voters and lawmakers in Congress.\nRudy Giuliani,\xa0asked about the near-daily attacks on the probe, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, “They are giving us the material. I couldn’t do it if I didn’t have the material. ... It is for public opinion.”\n“Because eventually, the decision here is going to be: impeach, [or] not impeach,” he continued.\xa0“Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be informed a lot by their constituents.

Republicans largely, independents pretty substantially, and even Democrats now question the legitimacy of it.”\nTrump in recent days has ratcheted up his attacks against the Russia investigation, the Justice Department and the FBI. He has claimed that the FBI had “infiltrated” and “spied”\xa0on his 2016 presidential campaign when the agency reportedly used\xa0an informant to make contact with Trump campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia. He also demanded the Justice Department investigate the accusations and turn over any relevant documents to Congress.\nMeanwhile, Democrats who attended a classified briefing about the informant with top DOJ officials last week said they saw “no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign.” Top Republicans who also attended the briefing have remained silent, however.\nAsked Sunday by CNN’s Dana Bash whether he believed the Russia probe is legitimate, Giuliani said, “Not anymore.”\n“I did when I came in, but now I see Spygate,” Giuliani said, using Trump’s preferred term for describing revelations that an FBI informant made contact with two of his campaign advisers as part of the investigation into Russia’s meddling.\n“I know 50 years of investigatory experience tells me they don’t have a darn thing because they would’ve used it already and they wouldn’t be off on collusion, they wouldn’t be off on Manafort, they wouldn’t be off on Cohen,” Giuliani added.\nWatch the full clip below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Sarah Sanders: It ‘Bothers Me’ Being Called A Liar',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says it bugs her when people accuse of her lying to the press.\n“It certainly bothers me,”\xa0she\xa0told The New York Times in a Wednesday article. “Because one of the few things you have are your integrity and reputation.”\nBut Sanders has told lots of lies, and it’s not hard to give examples. PolitiFact cites four times\xa0the White House press secretary gave objectively false information.\nShe said in a November briefing that diversity visa immigrants are not vetted (false). She said in an October briefing that Chicago, which has high rates of gun-related crimes, has the toughest gun laws in the country (pants on fire!). She claimed in July that President Donald Trump has “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence” (false),\xa0despite\xa0videos showing otherwise. In March 2017 she\xa0said “multiple news outlets” reported that when he was president, Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump (false).\nSome of the things Sanders has said are laughably untrue.\nShe insisted this month\xa0that the Trump administration is “committed to a free press” ― right after Trump hinted at\xa0stripping reporters of their credentials and claimed, once again, that mainstream news outlets critical of his presidency are “fake news.”\nIn May 2017,\xa0she claimed there was not “ever an attempt” to blame Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite a statement that week from then–press secretary Sean Spicer putting the blame squarely on Rosenstein.\n\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\n\nLook at all the reporters’ hands in the air.\xa0Why can’t they get factually correct answers?\n\n\n\nIn her defense, Sanders’ job sounds bananas. She has to provide accurate information given to her by a president who lies all the time. And in this White House, the level of chaos and turnover has been so high, it’s not hard to imagine that something that may be true in the morning is no longer true by that evening.\n“There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying,” Sanders said in the Times piece.\nBut part of her dishonesty is in her unwillingness to acknowledge when the president has said something that just isn’t true.\nWhen a reporter asked Sanders in October why Trump kept falsely saying that the U.S. is the highest-taxed nation in the world, she gave a hilariously nonsensical answer.\xa0In July, when Trump randomly criticized Rosenstein for being from Baltimore, even though he is from Philadelphia, Sanders couldn’t even admit that was wrong. She said Trump was making a “general statement.”\nReporters confronted Sanders earlier this month about why she falsely told them that Trump did not reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for $130,000 in hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels just before the November 2016 election.\n“You said, on March 7, ‘There was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he’s denied all of these allegations,’” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the May 3 press briefing. “Were you lying to us at the time, or were you in the dark?”\xa0\nSanders said only that Trump still denies the allegations by Daniels.\n“I gave you the best information that I had, and I’m going to continue to do my best to do that every single day,” she said.\nAs Sanders does her best to be truthful, there’s one group she has no problem calling out as liars: all 16 women who say Trump sexually assaulted them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Saudi Arabia Told The World Its Problem Was Islam. It’s Actually Tyranny.',
  'body': '\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t apologize for much. In the past year, his government has massacred civilians\xa0in Yemen, kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and spent $450 million of unknown provenance on a painting while rounding up hundreds of people\xa0for alleged corruption. He’s publicly defended those actions. \nBut there’s one thing the crown prince is always willing to express remorse about: Islam, or at least the version dominant in his country. “We were victims,” he recently told “60 Minutes.”\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s pitch to governments, citizens and, most importantly, investors, explicitly plays on global Islamophobia and many Muslims’ own frustrations about the violence committed in the name of their religion. It neatly identifies Islam as a problem and the prince as the solution. And this summer is supposed to bring a marquee moment for the battle against fundamentalist Islam\xa0the crown prince says he’s fighting: On June 24, women will gain the legal right to drive in Saudi Arabia.\nBut the “reformer” prince’s rhetoric is colliding with the reality of his rule. Since May 15, his government has been arresting human rights advocates\xa0— among them some of the most prominent Saudi women activists — in a crackdown that perpetuates\xa0long-standing Saudi repression.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s pitch to governments, citizens and, most importantly, investors, explicitly plays on global Islamophobia and many Muslims’ own frustrations about the violence committed in the name of their religion.\n\nThe crown prince’s playbook is an old one. For strongmen in the Muslim-majority world, the trope of the scary Muslim is invaluable. It allows them to bond with skeptics of Islam abroad — remember the orb? — and constantly justify their continued rule. \nAfter all, the argument goes, do you really want their people in charge instead? It’s the kind of language Syrian President Bashar Assad proudly uses to declare himself a vital defender of secularism and paint his opposition, including peaceful activists, as essentially too Muslim.\nTalk of “moderation” and “modernization” has defined regional rulers seeking to solidify their control since at least the early 20th century. But Muslim leaders became especially invested in that language after the 9/11 attacks prompted global soul-searching about the roots of terrorism, according to Annelle Sheline, a George Washington University doctoral student who studies the way governments in the region brand themselves.\nThese leaders watched with alarm as members of the George W. Bush administration argued that the key to peace was spreading democracy.\n“The Middle East regimes were not so interested in having the spotlight shined on their activities or sharing their power,” Sheline said. Eventually, “the Bush administration was fairly willing to buy into the bill of goods that a lot of Arab regimes were selling, which was that it’s not authoritarianism, it’s Islam, and we need to change Islam.”\nSo the regimes promised change. The Saudis pledged to cut hate speech from their textbooks. Jordan gathered 200 scholars\xa0for a declaration of Muslim tolerance and unity. Around the region, governments expanded their control over what was preached and discussed in mosques. Implicit throughout was the idea that they could identify and enshrine a “correct” Islam for subjects always on the verge of falling for fundamentalists, and that that was all the change the world needed to deal with al Qaeda and its affiliates.\nWhen the 2011 Arab Spring protests exposed how unhappy and marginalized many Muslims remained, the region’s authoritarians were in a bind. Some — like Assad, and Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi — set off nightmarish civil wars. Others tried to be more subtle, working to boost fears internationally about the figures gaining political power for the first time.\n“It was like, ‘Oh, good, if we let them have democracy, we have the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, or else we get war in Syria.’ There’s definitely been this sense that clearly these people aren’t ready for democracy,” Sheline said. She believes that argument is flawed because it doesn’t acknowledge how violent undemocratic regimes inspire more violence in their societies.\n\nAround the region, governments expanded their control over what was preached and discussed in mosques. Implicit throughout was the idea that they could identify and enshrine a “correct” Islam for subjects always on the verge of falling for fundamentalists.\n\nClaiming to take big steps toward moderation is especially difficult for the rulers of Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Mohammed claims the kingdom has only espoused a strict interpretation of Islam since Iran began doing so in 1979. But the truth is that proponents of ultra-traditionalist theology have been allied with the royal family for over 200 years. \nUnderpinning that alliance is one goal: the survival of a regime in which the al Saud family and clerics close to them are all-powerful. As long as that remains the crown prince’s ultimate priority ― and he authorizes those working for him to punish even the slightest questioning of the system ― any moves away from state-sponsored orthodoxy won’t make his society more stable.\nAbroad, too, it’s unclear that the crown prince’s vows of change will help to reduce militancy. \nMuslim communities from Indonesia to Kosovo have claimed that Saudi influence is responsible for fundamentalism that never existed previously. Saudi proselytizing did become intense after Iran started challenging its regional dominance, and Crown Prince Mohammed has admitted as much.\xa0But Saudi government influence over preachers, books and centers abroad receiving Saudi funding actually started declining before 9/11 and the rise of the Islamic State. \nAnd it’s unclear that reining in the Saudi government’s religious intervention abroad or Saudi individuals’ influence in other countries will magically reshape Islam. Violence and alienation drove people in places like Tunisia and Pakistan to terror groups long before Saudi petrodollars started flowing into their societies;\xa0they will continue to do so long after. \nNone of that is to say the crown prince and his ilk should start advising Muslims to become less tolerant. “To the extent that anybody buys into [Western-backed governments’ ‘moderate’ narrative], that’s good.\xa0We’d rather have the government putting out messages around toleration and moderation,” Sheline said of the view among U.S. officials. \nBut the cracks within Saudi Arabia, a country of 20 million people and the center of the global trade in energy and weapons, are not going away. Clamping down on intellectuals, stoking nationalism against Iran and calling activists “traitors” won’t heal them. Nor will the flows of foreign capital that Crown Prince Mohammed has identified as his top target. \nReal change will require rethinking Saudi “practice” altogether — not just the religious kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Jack Johnson Was Pardoned, But Taboo Sex Is Still Being Criminalized',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Jack Johnson on Thursday, erasing the black boxer’s century-old conviction for violating the Mann Act — a 1910 law that prohibited transporting “any woman or girl” across state lines “for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose” — by driving his white girlfriend from Pittsburgh to Chicago.\nThe timing of Trump’s decision was remarkable. Two months ago, Trump signed into law the bipartisan Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which holds websites accountable for any sex-trafficking-related content posted by users. Its backers pitched it as a way to combat human trafficking. But like the Mann Act, FOSTA targets some of the people it ostensibly aims to protect: It has already shuttered many of the websites that voluntary sex workers — those who are not trafficked — used to screen clients and keep themselves safe. \nAlthough drafted and signed more than a century apart,\xa0both laws are part of the United States’ long history of citing human trafficking as a pretext to crack down on consensual but taboo sex.\nAll this has happened before\nThe Mann Act, also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act, was enacted in response to public hysteria about sensational yet unconfirmed reports of white women being kidnapped and trafficked by foreign men. \n“There’s a huge range of things that [the act] allowed the government to punish and control,” Alexandra Levy, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, told HuffPost. “It gave tremendous leverage to punish interracial marriage, polygamy and promiscuity.” \nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, thousands of people were prosecuted under the act. Johnson’s conviction\xa0in 1912 was a prime example of the broad power of a law pitched as a way to stop what was at the time called white slavery. His crime was, essentially, being black and driving across state lines with a white woman,\xa0even though she went voluntarily and was his girlfriend. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven years after the Mann Act passed, federal officials instituted the American Plan to protect U.S.\xa0servicemen from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases before they took off to fight in World War I. The initiative allowed for the detention of women suspected of having a venereal disease. It was celebrated across the political spectrum for keeping American troops safe and for “curing” thousands of women of sexually transmitted infections ― though those “cures” often meant arsenic- and mercury-based medicines and involuntary sterilization. \nJust like the Mann Act, the plan took aim at some of the most vulnerable,\xa0like Nina McCall, a young poor white woman from Michigan who was arrested in 1918 under suspicion of being a prostitute. After her arrest, she was forcefully examined and medicated,\xa0then detained in a federal medical institution for three months. In Michigan alone, more than a thousand women\xa0were detained under the plan by 1918. \nThe Mann Act and the American Plan were swift responses to changes in American culture and the seemingly sudden rights and privileges granted women, said Scott W. Stern, who recently published\xa0a book about the McCall case. \n“In the early and late 1910s, women were getting the vote in various states, women were beginning to get formally educated, women were joining political parties, and premarital sex was skyrocketing, as was divorce,” he said. “Both the Mann Act and the American Plan were really about controlling women, and especially working-class and nonwhite women at a time when women were becoming ‘uncontrollable.’”\n“The Mann Act today is most famous because of the prosecutions of certain very prominent men, like Charlie Chaplin, Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson,” Stern continued. “Certainly those are notable cases, but what I think far too few people know is that the Mann Act was used to lock up huge amounts of women and police their lives.” \xa0\n\n\n\n\nAfro Newspaper / Gado / Getty Images\n\n\nJack Johnson in 1920 with his second wife, Lucille Cameron.\xa0He was often criticized for his romantic relationships with white women.\n\n\n\nThe first people arrested by officers of the Investigation Bureau — the Justice Department agency that would later become the FBI — for violating the Mann Act were a madam and five sex workers traveling together from Michigan to Chicago, Stern noted. \nSo while the Mann Act and the American Plan were ostensibly aimed at saving vulnerable women, in practice the initiatives allowed the Justice Department to control them, their sexuality, and the men they associated with ― many of whom were black or\xa0Chinese. \nA Pattern Repeated, Again and Again\nMeasures like the Mann Act and the American Plan set the stage for legislation like FOSTA. \nThe law aimed to curb human trafficking by holding websites and social platforms accountable for hosting content related to the sex trade. But much like the Mann Act and the American Plan, it polices members of already marginalized communities. \nThe new regulations pushed sites like Craigslist and Backpage to scrub their platforms of not only sex-trafficking-related content but sex-related content in general. That meant that not just sex traffickers\xa0but also voluntary sex workers and people who engage in online sexual activities were forced further underground. \nMelissa, a Phoenix-based escort, told HuffPost\xa0that FOSTA forced her back onto the streets. Lexi, a Florida-based escort, said she couldn’t screen her clients anymore without access to the sites. \nSex workers are often already members of marginalized communities, lacking easy access to banking and health care and safety from sexual or physical violence. \n“It’s an important parallel,” Levy said. \nThe Mann Act and FOSTA used similar tactics to pass with overwhelming majorities. The Mann Act was passed unanimously, Stern said. The House and Senate versions of FOSTA passed almost unanimously.\xa0\nThe Mann Act was written in response to accounts of enslavement of white women. Similarly, FOSTA used hysterical anti-trafficking rhetoric — often provided by evangelical Christian organizations that oppose all sex work — to garner support from the public.\n\n\n\n\nPool / Getty Images\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Act on April 11. Like the Mann Act a century earlier, the law is being used to target women.\n\n\n\n“The public is so easily manipulated when you say ‘trafficking,’” Levy said. “It’s a very emotionally provocative issue. You can sort of leverage that term.” In both cases, the public was galvanized by terrifying (and misleading) anecdotes of sex-trafficked children or white women, only for the legislation to be used against marginalized people after it was signed into law. \nTrump’s decision to pardon Johnson shows progress. But Johnson’s story also offers an important lesson, Levy argued.\n“It should call our attention to the fact that laws that purport to be anti-trafficking can mask very serious social agendas,” she said. “Hopefully we can learn from this.” \n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\nTrump Pardons Late Boxing Champion Jack Johnson\n\n\n‘This Bill Is Killing Us’: 9 Sex Workers On Their Lives In The Wake Of FOSTA\n\n\nTrump Signs Controversial Bill Targeting Online Sex Trafficking\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Talking Grievance And Health Care, An Outsider Kentucky Dem Found The Inside Track',
  'body': '\nUPDATE: May 22 ― Retired fighter pilot Amy McGrath won Tuesday’s Democratic primary in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, defeating Lexington Mayor Jim Gray.\xa0\n\ufeffPREVIOUSLY:\nLEXINGTON, Ky. ― Amy McGrath’s campaign for Congress hadn’t even officially started, and it was already broke. \nLast June, the former Marine fighter pilot retired from the military to move home to Kentucky and launch a political career. McGrath is everything a national Democratic campaign official would want in a new candidate ― she is a woman and a veteran, and while she isn’t a small business owner, her husband is. Still, she struggled to win over Democratic Party insiders in Kentucky and Washington, most of whom were waiting for Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, to decide whether he would pursue Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District seat instead.\nSo in July, with a bit of money in the bank and desperation beginning to set in, McGrath’s campaign manager, Mark Nickolas, decided that he had to do something crazy. He told McGrath, who hadn’t yet unpacked from her move, to dig her bomber jacket out of a box. He took his fledgling candidate to Lexington’s Blue Grass Airport, stood her in front of a fighter jet, and told Mark Putnam, the ad man who has made Democratic candidates from Missouri to Wisconsin go viral, to start filming.\nThe ad that resulted told a simple story: As a child, McGrath begged her congressman to help overturn the military’s ban on women in combat, to no avail. But the Pentagon reversed course when she was in high school. She enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marines and became the first woman to ever fly an F-18 fighter jet in combat.\nMcGrath relates this anecdote over b-roll of soaring jets, with a quick departure to point out that Republicans want to take away Kentuckians’ health care. You could discern the message of the commercial all the way from Paducah: McGrath is a woman and a fighter, and she won’t be deterred from achieving her goals.\xa0\n\nWhen Nickolas answered his cell phone on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, the day he planned to launch the ad, the voice on the other end had bad news: McGrath had raised just $50,000 so far. The ad had cost $57,000. Her campaign was $7,000 in the red, and she’d barely said hello.\n“I thought to myself, ‘Did I just destroy her career?’” Nickolas said.\nOn the contrary: Over the next three days, McGrath became a national political sensation, a symbol of the wave of Democratic women running for office in the age of Trump. Comedian Sarah Silverman called her a “badass” on Twitter. Chelsea Handler invited McGrath to appear on her show. More than 1 million people watched the video, and money ― lots of money ― began rolling in: McGrath raised more than $340,000 in the 72 hours after the commercial first aired.\nWhat the ad didn’t do, however, was win over national Democrats ― namely, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, which continued to recruit Gray. Neither did it push Gray out of the race: When he finally declared his candidacy in December, Gray held, according to McGrath’s own internal polling, a 40-point lead.\nBut handshake by handshake, McGrath quickly narrowed the gap. Going into Tuesday’s primary, she was either fast on Gray’s heels or out in front, depending on whose polling you believe, and the DCCC has quietly taken the position that either Democratic hopeful will have a strong chance to beat Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr in November.\xa0\n\nI think people are hungry for new leaders, and a new generation of leaders. They’re tired of the old guard. They want folks who aren’t hand-picked.\nAmy McGrath\n\nIdeologically speaking, there is little daylight between McGrath and Gray. The distinction between them lies mainly in affect and strategy, with McGrath continuing to push an outsider vs. insider narrative of the primary even as she seemed to become at least some of the insiders’ preferred candidate.\nWhile she may well lose her primary, McGrath’s campaign contains some lessons for a party desperate to flip districts like this one.\xa0She unabashedly pandered to the sort of discontent that swept President Donald Trump into office, but she took care to hitch it to issues like jobs and health care — particularly to the efforts of her state’s senior senator, Republican Mitch McConnell, to “take health care away from over a quarter-million Kentuckians.”\nGrievance plus stuff. Stick that on your lawn sign.\xa0 \xa0\nThe challenge facing McGrath’s campaign was immediately evident for any visitor to her campaign office near the University of Kentucky’s campus in Lexington.\xa0Her opponent had headquartered his 2016 campaign for Rand Paul’s U.S. Senate seat out of the same office; across the drive, a small house still had a “Gray for U.S. Senate” campaign sticker plastered on the front door.\nAnd though McGrath’s initial ad had garnered her national attention, Gray still seemed like an obvious front-runner in the early months of the race: He\xa0is the mayor of the district’s biggest base of reliably Democratic votes and oversees a city with a 3 percent unemployment rate. He won the 19-county area by three points in the Senate race against Paul. And in a year when the DCCC is going for broke trying to gain the 24 seats it needs to regain the House majority, Gray is a bit of a luxury: a wealthy businessman in a marginally competitive district who has the ability to relieve financial pressure on the national party by self-financing at least part of his campaign.\n\n\n\n\nBryan Woolston/Reuters\n\n\nLexington Mayor Jim Gray, Amy McGrath’s primary opponent, has promised to “send some adult supervision to Washington.”\n\n\n\nGray also comes with progressive bona fides: A popular mayor who’s transformed Lexington, he supported removing\xa0the city’s Confederate statues; he’s a small-town Kentuckian who helped turn his family business into a construction giant; he’s viewed favorably by\xa077 percent of primary voters. He supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Obamacare; he touts a record of targeting utility monopolies that would seem to fit neatly into the new Democratic antitrust agenda. A win in the primary and again in November would make him the first openly gay congressman in Kentucky’s history.\nBut what would ordinarily be a compelling biography instead became something of a liability in an election year that has thus far favored political outsiders ― especially when they’re women. In Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nebraska and beyond, insurgent female candidates have knocked off more established opponents with stronger-on-paper political resumes, feeding off the sense that Americans (and especially Democrats) want a new generation of political leaders to emerge.\nSo what Gray and national Democrats saw as strengths, McGrath and her team instantly pegged as weaknesses. Without much room to differentiate herself on the issues, McGrath instead chose to paint Gray as a favorite son of the national Democratic establishment, the hand-picked choice of Washington rather than of central Kentucky.\n“I think people are hungry for new leaders, and a new generation of leaders,” she said. \xa0“They’re tired of the old guard. They want folks who aren’t hand-picked.”\nThe characterization isn’t exactly accurate: Aside from the Senate run, Gray’s entire political career has been spent on the Lexington city council or in the mayor’s office, and he’s hardly been a prominent voice in statewide or national Democratic politics. But by playing up her status as an outsider ― a veteran, a mother, a woman, three things she says there aren’t enough of in Congress ― McGrath’s narrative has taken hold nonetheless, and her calls to shake up Congress have resonated strongly against Gray’s safer, duller call to “send some adult supervision to Washington.”\n\n\n\n\nPatrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\nA victory on Tuesday would make Amy McGrath the latest woman from outside the Democratic political mainstream to succeed in the 2018 primaries.\n\n\n\nYet as McGrath’s national profile grew after her first ad, she remained relatively unknown and perhaps even a little suspect to Kentucky voters. A native of Edgewood in northern Kentucky, she’d never lived in the central part of the state and had only relocated to the district in June, upon retiring from the U.S. Naval Academy.\xa0\n(Gray attempted to punch back on this point in the race’s closing days, releasing an ad that hit McGrath for only recently moving to Kentucky. But groups like VoteVets, a nonprofit that promotes veteran candidates and their issues, have slammed the ad as an attempt to “swift-boat” McGrath’s campaign.)\nEven before Gray entered the race, Nickolas, who had managed former Rep. Ben Chandler’s (D) successful 6th District campaign in 2004, outlined an aggressive retail politicking strategy to get McGrath in front of voters ― not just on TV, but in their homes, churches, billboards and mailboxes.\nNickolas ― who thought he was out of politics for good until Chandler urged him to meet with McGrath ― said he was instantly swayed by her grasp of the issues and the realities of politics, which she had honed during stints working for Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.) in Congress during her time in the military. Most of all, he was impressed by her passion, and he banked on his belief that if they had to chance to meet her, Kentucky voters would feel the same.\nMcGrath, meanwhile, purchased ad space in every local newspaper in the district and published an editorial detailing why she had chosen to run now, in 2018, and here, in central Kentucky. She piggybacked off the popularity of the initial ad, which gained her thousands of social media followers, to hold Q&A’s with voters in the district that were broadcast on Facebook. She hit all 19 counties in her first few months in the race, stumping across the region and spending hours, even days, in areas that had once been reliable Democratic strongholds but have trended red for more than a decade.\nIn a district where Democrats still hold a registration advantage, she has pushed the message that the national party has abandoned its voters here. “The Democrats here feel left behind by the national party,” she said. “The national party, to them,\xa0is Washington D.C. They don’t have the same values. They’re led by San Francisco and New York. They don’t see leaders from here or the Midwest. And they’re focused on the wrong things.”\n\nYou can be a progressive and still do well in more conservative areas, as long as those rural voters get a sense that you’ll fight for them.\nMcGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas\n\nLed by San Francisco and New York. You don’t need a decoder pin to understand what McGrath getting at. But she goes no further. She doesn’t counterpose issues of identity — transgender access to bathrooms, women’s rights, race — against the economic concerns of white, working-class voters. McGrath is pro-choice. She’s a vocal critic of Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from the military. She thinks his effort to ban refugees and immigrants from majority Muslim countries is discriminatory and misguided. \nMcGrath doesn’t shy away from those issues when voters bring them up, and she believes her military service helps bridge the gap between the two sides when they do disagree. But she’s primarily focused on what she sees as the concerns that the district’s old-school Democrats who’ve been voting Republican still share with the national party: chiefly, health care and the economy. \nShe has argued for not just protecting the Affordable Care Act but expanding it to include a public option and a lower age of eligibility for Medicare, against the Republican tax cut package for which incumbent Barr voted, and for raising the minimum wage. She describes herself as a “fiscal conservative,” but mostly to score points off of Barr for passing deficit-fattening tax cuts after years of fear-mongering on that very same issue. \nAnd in a direct appeal to the rural parts of the district, she’s advocated for an expansive role for the federal government, arguing that it should invest heavily in broadband, infrastructure, and job and economic development in areas left behind by the decline of manufacturing and the collapse of the coal industry.\n“We ought to have the federal government funding high-speed broadband in those areas. And we ought to do it for our country,” McGrath argued during an interview in her Lexington campaign office. “Eisenhower didn’t say, ‘Let’s let private industry build the highways.’ No, the government did that. And it powered our country. FDR brought electricity to Appalachia. The federal government did that.”\nMcGrath speaks in a folksy, unpolished manner, with the occasional curse word slipping out, her voice rising and falling and sometimes cracking as she talks about the ugly direction the country she fought for has taken, or about Barr’s vote to repeal the health care law that gave thousands of local residents coverage for the first time. “The average household income here in Kentucky is about $50,000. That’s not a lot,” she said. “When you have Andy Barr coming in and saying, ‘I’m going to repeal Obamacare and give you health savings accounts’ ― dude, they don’t have the money for health savings accounts.”\nThe more Kentuckians have gotten to see of McGrath, the more the message she’s aiming for has set in.\xa0\n“A lot of people say they want to shake things up. She’s believable in that regard, just because of her demeanor,” said Al Cross, a veteran Kentucky political journalist. “She comes across as somebody who wants to get things done and won’t take no for an answer.”\n\nThe average household income here in Kentucky is about $50,000 ... When you have Andy Barr coming in and saying, ‘I’m going to repeal Obamacare and give you health savings accounts’ ― dude, they don’t have the money for health savings accounts.\nAmy McGrath\n\nThat invocation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, meanwhile, isn’t an accident ― it was the New Deal and the local economic populists who supported it, like former Kentucky Sen. (and Vice President) Alben Barkley, who painted the state blue a century ago. In a state where Democrats have continually lost ground over the last decade, McGrath is arguing that “we have to talk about the things that made these people Democrats in the first place,” Cross said. “FDR is the guy who confirmed people as Democrats. And Alben Barkley did too. And it’s been a long time since either of those guys were around.”\nEven before the polls began to shift, there were signs that the strategy was working. Last fall, McGrath traveled to Anderson County ― one of the district’s largest counties ― to meet with Ben Carlson, the conservative editor of the local daily newspaper, the Anderson News. Carlson was impressed, not just by McGrath, but by the enthusiasm people had about her.\n“I haven’t sensed, in a congressional race, this kind of enthusiasm for a candidate in the 12 years I’ve been running the paper. For either party,” Carlson said. “She’s brought that kind of excitement to it.”\nTo Nickolas, that’s evidence that this sort of hyperlocal campaigning in districts where voters increasingly feel detached from both sides of the national debate can help Democrats win back seats. \n“I think it’s a reminder that sometimes we get away from the fundamentals,” Nickolas said. “We get seduced by the latest way of communicating. Too many campaigns put their money on TV and digital, and what suffers is the old school face-to-face communication with voters.”\nMcGrath’s style of campaigning, Nickolas believes, is crucial for Democrats in purplish districts like Kentucky’s 6th. The grievance gets people’s attention; the stuff gets their votes.\n“They want to know: ‘Are you going to go to Congress and represent me? Are you going to care about me?’” Nickolas said. “She leads with that: ‘We may not agree on some of the issues. But you should believe that I’m going to have your back.’”\nHe continued: “You can be a progressive and still do well in more conservative areas, as long as those rural voters get a sense that you’ll fight for them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Mitch McConnell Taps Anti-LGBTQ Bigot For Religious Freedom Panel',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― One of the most prominent anti-LGBTQ leaders in the country is now a federal appointee shaping U.S. policy on religious freedom, thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council ― which the Southern Poverty Law Center\xa0considers a hate group\xa0― announced Wednesday that McConnell appointed him to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. It’s a two-year term, and his responsibilities include “monitor[ing] the universal right to freedom of religion or belief abroad” and making policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state and Congress.\n“I am grateful to Majority Leader McConnell for appointing me to this prestigious position,” Perkins said in a statement. “It is my hope that through the work of USCIRF, the world will become one step closer to recognizing the vital role religious freedom and the defense of religious minorities play in peace, security and human flourishing.”\nPerkins brings to the commission a long record of condemning and denying rights to LGBTQ people, which he and other conservatives like Vice President Mike Pence have been doing for years\xa0in the name of religious freedom.\nHe claimed\xa0in 2010 that the high suicide rate among gay teenagers is not because of societal homophobia, but because they know they are “abnormal.” That same year, Perkins described Uganda’s so-called “kill the gays” bill, which imposed the death penalty for homosexuality, as an effort to “uphold moral conduct.”\nIn 2014, he warned that an anti-Christian holocaust was imminent and said LGBTQ advocates were “going to start rolling out the boxcars to start hauling off Christians.”\nPerkins was behind an unsuccessful effort in 2016 to insert the debunked practice of “gay conversion therapy” into the Republican Party platform. He’s compared the practice to saving someone from a burning building.\nIn 2017, Perkins authored a letter signed by evangelical leaders calling on President Donald Trump to reverse Obama-era guidance allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military. He also co-authored a report with Pence\xa0in an effort to justify the ban on transgender troops.\n\n\n\n\nScott J. Ferrell via Getty Images\n\n\nHere’s Tony Perkins, second from right, with then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) in 2006, right after the House\xa0rejected a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. They were both sad about that.\n\n\n\nHere’s Perkins\xa0in 2011 describing people who advocate for LGBTQ rights: “They’re intolerant. They’re hateful. They’re vile. They’re spiteful. Our response to them should be one of love... But let me tell you what, it’s not love to be silent in the face of those who are advancing an agenda that is both destructive to our society and, more importantly, destructive to the individuals involved. To me, that is the height of hatred.”\nIn that same speech,\xa0he said LGBTQ rights advocates are “pawns” of Satan (!).\nPerkins’ record gives some insight into the kinds of recommendations he might now make to Trump regarding countries where LGBTQ people are oppressed in the name of religion.\nThe White House also just appointed evangelical activist Gary Bauer to the commission.\xa0Bauer has said that LGBTQ rights will lead to “the criminalization of Christianity,” and claimed that gay people will try to take children away from parents who don’t agree with same-sex marriage.\nLGBTQ rights groups are horrified by their appointments.\xa0\n“In their America, LGBTQ people would be forced to hide who they are or face criminal sanction, their relationships would be unrecognized, their children could be taken away and LGBTQ youth would face harmful conversion therapy,” said Human Rights Campaign spokeswoman Charlotte Clymer, who used to write about social justice issues for HuffPost’s open blog platform.\n“For the Trump-Pence White House to nominate them to this position is insulting to our core American values and ignores the reality of the vast majority of Americans who believe religious freedom and equality are not only compatible but essential in 21st Century America,” she said.\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart had no comment.\nHe indicated the\xa0office typically does not comment on appointments made directly by McConnell as opposed to those made by the full Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nBishop Michael Curry,\xa0the Christian leader who emerged as an unexpected star last Saturday\xa0during Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding, is taking his message of love to the streets.\nCurry joined dozens of other progressive Christian leaders in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night for a candle-lit vigil and march to the White House that aimed to “reclaim” Christianity.\xa0An organizer told HuffPost that up to 2,000 people packed into the National City Christian Church to hear Curry and other prominent Christians preach before the march.\nCurry, a Chicago native and the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church,\xa0emphasized the importance of love in a time when he believes the integrity of the Christian faith is at stake.\n“Love your neighbor,” Curry said during the service. “Love the neighbor you like and the neighbor you don’t like. Love the neighbor you agree with and the neighbor you don’t agree with. Love your Democrat neighbor, your Republican neighbor, your black neighbor, your white neighbor, your Anglo neighbor, your Latino neighbor and your LGBTQ neighbor. Love your neighbor! That’s why we’re here!”\n\n\n\n\nRebekah Fulton/Sojourners\n\n\nBishop Michael Curry, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, preaches at the\xa0National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., before a march to the White House.\n\n\n\nThe event had been planned for weeks before Curry gave his impassioned sermon about love during the\xa0Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding on May 19. But some Christians are hoping that the bishop’s newfound popularity will\xa0help highlight the progressive faith movement ―\xa0and prove that conservative evangelicals don’t have an exclusive claim on interpreting Christianity.\xa0\nFor Curry and others involved in the march, being Christian means rejecting white nationalism and misogyny; it means protecting immigrants, refugees and the poor.\nThe speakers did not\xa0mention\xa0President\xa0Donald Trump directly during the service on Thursday night. Curry himself insisted that “we are not a left-wing group; we are not a right-wing group. We are a Jesus movement.”\n\n\n\n\nRebekah Fulton/Sojourners\n\n\nPeople participate in a march to “reclaim Jesus” in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nHowever, the leaders signed a declaration that contained references to the Trump administration’s actions and policies.\xa0\nCurry said that he and other Christian leaders from various denominations had gathered for a Lenten retreat this year to talk about the state of Christianity in an increasingly polarized nation.

Global poverty, environmental damage, violent conflict, weapons of mass destruction, and deadly diseases in some places ultimately affect all places, and we need wise political leadership to deal with each of these.”\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nEpiscopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry (L) and Sojourners President and Founder Rev. Jim Wallis (R) lead fellow clergy in a vigil.\n\n\n\nThe leaders also condemned the\xa0“normalization of lying” and politicians who neglect the ethic of public service and accountability “in favor of personal recognition and gain often characterized by offensive arrogance.”\n“We are deeply concerned for the soul of our nation, but also for our churches and the integrity of our faith,” the leaders wrote.\nThe White House did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.\nWatch a livestream of the service below.\xa0\n\nThe declaration was co-signed by Rev.

Dr. Joel C. Hunter,\xa0a former megachurch pastor from Florida who served as one of former President Barack Obama’s spiritual advisers.\xa0It also featured other prominent black Protestant, mainline Protestant, Catholic and evangelical leaders.\nFollowing the service, the crowd participated in a silent march to Lafayette Square, a park facing the White House.

 {'title': 'Shoppers Boycott Publix Over Store’s Donations To NRA-Backed Candidate',
  'body': '\nSome Florida shoppers are vowing to boycott grocery store Publix ahead of the busy Memorial Day weekend after the regional chain donated more than a half-million dollars to a gubernatorial candidate who touts himself as a “proud NRA sellout.”\nEarlier this month, local media first revealed\xa0the grocer’s $670,000 in donations over the last three years to Republican candidate Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner.\nPutnam, who brands himself as a lifelong gun owner, opposed Gov. Rick Scott’s (R) gun control law signed in the wake of February’s deadly mass shooting\xa0at a Parkland, Florida, high school.\nPutnam had said Scott’s decision to raise the age to purchase a rifle or a shotgun from 18 to 21\xa0“destroys the family tradition of possessing and practicing safe use of firearms.” The National Rifle Association, which immediately sued to block the gun law, applauded Putnam’s stance.\nPublix is Florida’s largest private employer, according to The Tampa Bay Times, and its political donations to Putnam are likely some of the largest since 1995, if not in the company’s history.\xa0\nNow the\xa0#BoycottPublix petition\xa0has spread across social media.\nNo, @Publix.

Including last week’s deadly shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school, there have been 16 school shootings this year,\xa0according to a count by The Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nPublix said in a statement to HuffPost Tuesday evening that the company has a “history of supporting candidates focused on job growth and a healthy Florida economy.”\n“We regret that some of our political contributions have led to an unintentional customer divide instead of our desire to support a growing economy in Florida,” the company said.\xa0“As a result of this situation, we are evaluating our processes to ensure that our giving better reflects our intended desire to support a strong economy and a healthy community.”\nThose vowing to boycott Publix have argued that supporting Putnam directly supports the NRA because of his promise to uphold the group’s beliefs.\n“I’m very sad I’ll never experience the joy of a [Publix sub] again but nothing tastes as good as being on the right side of the fight,” tweeted social media user Gabriella Juliet,\xa0who used the boycott hashtag.\nWhether the boycott will affect the company ― which has 1,183 stores in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia ― remains to be seen.\n\n\n\n\nNicolasMcComber via Getty Images\n\n\nPublix, which has over 1,000 stores across the southeast, has donated more than a half a million dollars to gubernatorial candidate and current agricultural commissioner Adam Putnam.\n\n\n\nAccording to personal finance website WalletHub, 60 percent of Americans plan to barbecue over the Memorial Day weekend, with $1.5 billion worth of meat and seafood being purchased for the event. Memorial Day is also the second most popular day for beer sales, just behind Independence Day.\nDavid Jenkins, a Tampa resident who said he is participating in the boycott, estimated to the Times that he spends $500 to $600 a month at Publix stores. He said he’s now taking his business to competitor Winn-Dixie.\n“I’m sure if you went through every corporate chain you could find something you disagree with, but there’s a certain point where you draw a line,” he told the paper. “This situation — where the amount of money is so substantial and the stakes so high — is the line.”\n\n\n\n\nJoe Skipper / Reuters\n\n\nAdam Putnam, who has called himself an “NRA sellout,” opposed a state-wide gun control law that was passed in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shooting.\n\n\n\nPublix has financially supported Putnam as a political candidate since at least 1995, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\nPublix has explained its support for Putnam as him being a “hometown candidate” from Polk County, where the company was founded, and having “a long-standing relationship” with the grocer.\nThe Times reported that in 2016, during his second term as commissioner of agriculture, Putnam once pulled the results of failed health inspections of seven Publix stores from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’s website. He then eliminated the pass/fail grading system and made it so the worst rating possible is “re-inspection required.”\nFlorida’s primary elections are on Aug. 28. The state’s gubernatorial election is on Nov. 6.\nPutnam’s challengers include U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.\xa0The Democratic candidates are former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, former U.S. Rep.

 {'title': 'How The Chinese Exclusion Act Can Help Us Understand Immigration Politics Today',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― In 1882, Congress voted to ban an entire ethnic group from immigrating to the United States.\xa0\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act, iterations of which remained on the books for over 60 years, had a lasting effect on the history of U.S. immigration, as depicted in a new PBS documentary airing Tuesday. \nFilmmakers Ric Burns (brother of Ken) and Li-Shin Yu trace not only the law’s development and implementation but also its connection to other integral parts of American history unfolding contemporaneously,\xa0like segregation in the Jim Crow South, urbanization on the East and West Coasts, and trade abroad.\nAt a screening of the film last week, Burns called the Chinese Exclusion Act a “quintessentially American story” and described it as “the biggest part of American history that people don’t know about,” because you would be hard-pressed to find it mentioned in many history courses.\n\nIf you want to know about immigration in America and you don’t know the story of Chinese exclusion, it would be like saying you want to know about race relations in America, but you’ve never heard of slavery.”\nFilmmaker Ric Burns\n\nIn the film, several historians marvel that some Americans are shocked to learn about the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n“Many Americans today cannot believe this happened. How could this country, with its culture, with its politics, with its economics, do what it did against a whole class of people?” NYU professor John Kuo Wei Tchen says.\nBut while watching the documentary amid today’s political climate, it isn’t unbelievable at all. Burns and Yu acknowledged that it doesn’t take much effort to see parallels to President Donald Trump’s America — though this was not their original intention, as they began working on the film six years ago, Burns said.\nCentral to the bill’s 1882 passage were political attacks on Chinese immigrants that labeled them “unassimilable” and portrayed them as economic threats to white Americans and a filthy scourge on society. The film shows how newspaper headlines and editorial cartoons from that period disseminated this propaganda.\n\n\n\n\nSteeplechase Films/The Chinese Exclusion Act\n\n\n“The Anti-Chinese Wall,” an 1882 political cartoon from “The Puck” magazine, which reads: “The American Wall Goes Up as the Chinese Original Goes down.” Courtesy of the Library of Congress.\n\n\n\nNineteenth-century politicians’ nativism and fear-mongering are remarkably similar to today’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. President Donald Trump famously began his presidential campaign by saying that Mexico was sending rapists, drug dealers, and criminals to the U.S. \nOther right-wing political figures have raised the old complaint that certain immigrants are unassimilable.\xa0During an NPR interview earlier this month,\xa0Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, said that undocumented immigrants are “not people that would easily assimilate” and “don’t integrate well” — an uncanny reminder of how this political language persists.\nBurns sees another commonality in the rhetoric: the “factless nature” of claims that immigrants are stealing our jobs.\n“Both then and now, there’s zero truth to it,” he said. “These things almost never have any basis in reality. It becomes a function of playing to fears, playing to usually white vulnerabilities, and finding wedge issues for politicians.”\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act tells us all we need to know not just about immigration, but about the story of America.\n\nThese parallels make it particularly difficult and infuriating to watch the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act unfold in the film,\xa0including how it raised questions about birthright citizenship that were later settled in an 1898 Supreme Court case.\nTrump is among those who have relitigated the issue in the decades since: During his presidential campaign, he\xa0suggested abolishing birthright citizenship.\nThere are also echoes of the Chinese Exclusion Act in the\xa0legal battle over Trump’s travel ban, which\xa0bars people largely from majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. It’s yet another compelling piece of evidence for the film’s central argument: The Chinese Exclusion Act tells us all we need to know not just about immigration, but about the story of America.\n\n\n\n\nSteeplechase Films/The Chinese Exclusion Act\n\n\nA\xa0poster celebrating the Chinese Exclusion Act’s passage, proclaiming that “The White Man is on Top.”\xa0Courtesy of the Royal BC Museum.\n\n\n\nThe events of the film intersect with another grim period of American history: the Jim Crow era in the South. According to the film, the California politicians spearheading discrimination against Chinese immigrants built support for the exclusion act by compromising with Southern politicians trying to pass measures to systematically disenfranchise black people. The political maneuvering, which Burns referred to as “horse-trading,” essentially amounted to exchanging one form of discrimination for another.\nSexism and misogyny also fueled the fire. Laws that helped lay the foundation for the 1882 bill were particularly discriminatory against Chinese women, who were stereotyped as prostitutes. As Columbia University historian Mae Ngai relates in the film, Chinese women were required to prove they were not prostitutes to be admitted to the U.S, a process so stringent that it effectively discouraged most women from immigrating.\nThrough these connections, the documentary effectively makes the case that the Chinese Exclusion Act is fundamental to questions of American identity.\n“It is not a melodramatic or breathlessly hyperbolic thing to say that if you want to know about immigration in America and you don’t know the story of Chinese exclusion, it would be like saying you want to know about race relations in America but you’ve never heard of slavery,” Burns said.\nBurns and Yu said they intend for the film to be an educational tool, and PBS and the Center for Asian American Media are distributing it to schools\xa0so that learning about Chinese exclusion becomes a given in U.S. history class.\n“Just the way you know about the Fourth of July, you know about the Civil War, and you know about the Pilgrims — usually a ludicrously cartoonish way,” Burns said, “you’ll at least have a ludicrously cartoonish version of the Chinese Exclusion Act.”\n“The Chinese Exclusion Act” premieres on PBS on Tuesday at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Texas Governor’s School Safety Plan Proposes Modest Changes To Gun Laws',
  'body': '\nTwelve days after a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Wednesday released a wide-ranging set of proposals that he says will keep students safer.\nThe 43-page document covers a number of areas, including school security, mental health care and gun laws related to firearm safety.\nAt a press conference at the school district headquarters in Dallas, Abbott called the plan a “starting point,” while working to balance his standing as a gun rights supporter with his newfound willingness to explore modest reforms of firearm laws.\n“I doubt there has been a Texas governor with a more pro-gun record than myself,” Abbott said.\xa0“I can assure you, I will never allow Second Amendment rights to be infringed. But I will always promote responsible gun ownership, and that includes keeping guns safe and keeping them out of the hands of criminals.”\nAmong Abbott’s proposed changes to gun laws would be a strengthening of his state’s child access prevention law, which currently only applies to incidents in which a child under 17 obtains a “readily dischargeable” firearm from an adult’s property.\nThe alleged attacker in Santa Fe, a 17-year-old student, reportedly took his father’s legally owned revolver and shotgun and brought them to class concealed under a trenchcoat. Because of the gunman’s age, his parents can’t be held criminally liable for his actions under state law.\nAbbott said he supports adjusting the statute to cover anyone under 18, as well as strengthening the penalty to a third-degree felony in any case where child access results in death or serious bodily injury.\xa0The current law only provides for misdemeanor charges.\nThe law should also be clarified to include both loaded and unloaded guns stored around children,\xa0which could make it easier for prosecutors to pursue these charges, the proposal states. Recent reports have shown the Texas law is used very infrequently.\n\n\n\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters\n\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) speaks at the annual National Rifle Association convention in Dallas on May 4.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Abbott called for the legislature to authorize a study on a “red flag” law, which would allow law enforcement,\xa0family members, school employees or district attorneys to file petitions seeking the removal of firearms from dangerous individuals.\nEight states currently have red flag laws on the books, and three states, including Florida, have put these laws in place since the February shooting in Parkland. The NRA-affiliated Texas State Rifle Association has said it would oppose any such measure over concerns that it could lead to the violation of due process. Abbott has clarified that any confiscation of firearms must come after “due process is provided.”\nA Texas red flag law could have a substantial effect on shootings, said Ed Scruggs, spokesman for Texas Gun Sense, a nonprofit focused on gun violence prevention.\n“We believe that has a lot of potential to prevent major tragedies and especially suicides,” he told HuffPost.\nThe governor’s report specifically notes that red flag orders “could have been used to prevent the shootings” at Sutherland Springs, where 26 people were killed at a church in November, and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where 17 people were killed.\nAbbott also urged lawmakers to work on legislation to require gun owners to report when their firearms are lost or stolen within 10 days.\xa0An estimated 177,000 guns were stolen in Texas between 2012 and 2015, according to a 2017 report. Only 12 states currently require gun owners to report the loss or theft of a firearm.\nOverall, the proposal is far from perfect, Scruggs said. But considering the reliably fraught politics of the gun debate in Texas, it could have been worse.\n“There are some positive steps that most people would classify as moderate steps or basic steps, but for Texas it really represents some form of progress,” he said.\nAlthough Abbott’s willingness to discuss changes to gun laws may come as a surprise to some, most of his proposed measures don’t involve legislative reform.\n“The strategy that I most strongly encourage the Legislature to consider is greater investment in mental health,” Abbott said at Wednesday’s press conference.\nAbbott specifically described his support for expanding a telemedicine program designed to identify junior high and high school students at risk of committing violence and intervene by providing them with mental health services. The program, developed by Texas Tech University and facilitated through the university’s health services center, is already in use in a number of Texas school districts and has shown positive results in the form of reduced truancy and discipline among referred students.\nThe document lays out a number of measures to fortify schools by increasing the number of armed personnel,\xa0potentially including teachers, on campus. Other proposals would increase the use of metal detectors, monitoring and surveillance, and would explore new construction to maintain greater control of school entrances, exits and external access.\nAltogether, the initiatives would cost $110 million to implement, around $70 million of which is already available in the form of federal funding and state grants, according to the report.\nTo gun violence prevention advocates,\xa0it would be well worth the investment. Since 2009,\xa0Texas has experienced at least 20 mass shootings involving at least four fatalities apiece, the most of any state. These events have included the Sutherland Springs massacre, two separate shootings at Fort Hood, a 2016 attack on police officers in Dallas and many instances of domestic violence.\nAbbott’s plan follows three days of roundtable discussions held last week with a number of groups,\xa0as well as survivors of the Santa Fe shooting.\nMany of the measures in Abbott’s blueprint would require approval from the Texas Legislature, which is not currently in session.\xa0Abbott said he would be open to calling a special session to consider the bills, as long as there was “consensus” among lawmakers on some of the legislation.\nIf the governor doesn’t act, the legislature will reconvene in January, two months after the November elections, when Abbott will face Democrat Lupe Valdez, the former sheriff of Dallas County.\nIn the wake of the Santa Fe shooting, Valdez and others have called for Abbott to pursue stronger gun laws, and specifically universal background checks for all firearm purchases.\xa0Abbott’s plan dismisses that proposal, arguing that many criminals get firearms via the black market, where background checks don’t apply.\nRead the entire plan below:\n Texas School Safety Action Plan by Nick Wing on Scribd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Census Citizenship Fight Will Sway States’ Political Clout, Federal Money',
  'body': '\n\xa0\n\n\n\n\nDave Martin/AP\n\n\nDemonstrators gather outside the Alabama Capitol in protest of a new state immigration law. The U.S. Census Bureau announced this year it plans to ask all households about citizenship for the first time since 1950. \n\n\n\nBy Tim Henderson \nAs preparation for the 2020 census intensifies, states and cities are fighting over how — or whether — to accurately count the roughly 11 million immigrants living in the United States without authorization, a battle that will have a huge impact on federal aid and states’ political power for years to come.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau announced this year it plans to ask all households about citizenship status, a query not broached since 1950 and one that is now inflaming states’ angst over clout.\nMany officials say the new census question will intimidate immigrants and stop them from answering any questions, resulting in an undercount that would make it harder for a city or state to provide services, said Greg Stanton, a Democrat who was mayor of Phoenix before resigning May 29 to run for Congress.\xa0\n“I have to serve all the city’s people,” Stanton said in an interview with Stateline. “If we fail to get an accurate count, that’s going to hurt our city and our whole state. It should be a bipartisan issue.”\nA state’s number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives is based on its population — as are a variety of federal funding initiatives for cities and states alike — so a lot is at stake for governors and local officials in the way their residents are counted. With limited federal grant dollars and just 435 seats in Congress’ lower chamber, many officials believe they’re playing a zero-sum game for power and money.\nAlabama recently filed suit against the U.S. Census Bureau to stop the census from counting such immigrants at all — an unlikely outcome considering the Supreme Court’s position in a 2016 decision. Alabama argues that if states such as California and Texas get to count immigrants who don’t have legal documentation, then Alabama, which has relatively few undocumented immigrants, surely will suffer. The state argues that it stands to lose a seat in Congress, along with an electoral vote. It could also lose federal funding.\n\n\n\n \nMeanwhile the Phoenix City Council voted last week to sue the Census Bureau to block the citizenship question, as have several other cities and counties, and more than two dozen states with growing immigrant populations.\nThe Phoenix metro area has an estimated quarter-million residents who don’t have authorization to live in the United States, the 10th most among U.S. cities, according to 2014 estimates by the Pew Research Center (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds Stateline and the research center). Each uncounted person would cost the city more than $500 a year in lost state and federal funding, according to a city analysis.\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, has declined to join the lawsuit, with a spokesman saying in April that the governor supports data-gathering.\nAlabama’s lawsuit, filed this month, claims that a full count of immigrants would punish the state, giving it less political clout in Washington, D.C., and less federal funding than those states with more immigrants living in the United States illegally. (The Fourteenth Amendment apportions congressional seats by population, not citizenship.)\nThe state saw its immigrant population plummet after leaders enacted a law in 2011 making it a crime to live there without legal authorization or to hire, house or transport those residents. People fled to other states, and Alabama’s unauthorized population dropped nearly 20 percent, to 65,000, between 2009 and 2012, and had not rebounded by 2014, according to the research center estimates, after courts struck down many provisions of the law.\nThe 2020 census could, the lawsuit states, result in “roughly 20 Congressional seats taken from low-illegal alien population states and given to high-illegal alien states like California.” U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, also is a plaintiff.\nU.S. Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, introduced an unsuccessful bill last year calling for the census to ask about citizenship and legal status. But no state has followed Alabama in suing to stop the census from counting unauthorized immigrants altogether.\nSteven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that favors less immigration, said he sympathizes with Alabama but doesn’t think suing the U.S. Census Bureau is the answer.\n“It is a problem,” Camarota said. “More congressional seats will go to places like Arizona and Texas and California. Is it right to count people who do not belong in this country and take representation away from American citizens? It’s tough.”\nThe ‘Three-Fifths Compromise’\nThe question of how the United States apportions states’ political power, and whether to include people who can’t vote, has been answered in different ways throughout its history.\nDelegates to the 1787 U.S. Constitutional Convention determined that states could count their slaves as “three-fifths” of a free person — a compromise between the North, which didn’t want slaves counted at all, and the South, which wanted them fully counted to boost the region’s representation in the new House of Representatives.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 struck down that compromise and inspired Congress to increase the House of Representatives’ size with the 1870 census to ensure balanced representation between Northern and Southern states.\nMore reapportionment laws followed in 1890, 1901 and 1911, as censuses were conducted and political interests jockeyed for power.\nAnd immigration has played a role in reapportionment: In 1929, after millions of newcomers poured through Ellis Island, members of Congress — worried about rapid urbanization — required automatic reapportionment following every census. Yet another mathematical formula followed in 1941.\nPhil Sparks, a co-director of the Census Project, a nonpartisan coalition that is pushing for more money for the 2020 count to improve its accuracy, said the citizenship question could be part of a Republican strategy to use citizens or voters alone as the basis for seats in Congress, which would erode Democratic power in Congress. The Census Project would be opposed to that, Sparks said.\n“This is a two-step process,” Sparks said of what he calls a GOP strategy. “First you get the citizenship data, then you change the way seats are distributed so it’s based on voters or citizens alone.”\nCounting voting-eligible population instead of all people in apportionment decisions would cut Democratic and Latino seats in Congress as well as in state legislatures, according to a 2015 study by former Harvard visiting scholar and political scientist Carl Klarner. It would also dilute power for African-Americans and poor people.\nKimball Brace, president of Election Data Services and a consultant who has worked on redistricting in 13 states, said the Alabama lawsuit is unlikely to change the nation’s system of using total population, rather than voting population, to apportion U.S. House seats.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that approach in 2016 in Evenwel v. Abbott, upholding the right of states to use total population for redistricting.\n“Representatives serve all residents, not just those eligible to vote,” read the majority opinion written by justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “Nonvoters have an important stake in many policy debates and in receiving constituent services.”\nHowever, the decision did not rule out the possibility that individual states could use voters or citizens as a gauge, rather than total population, when drawing state district boundaries. Missouri’s Legislature is considering a Republican-sponsored bill requiring that only citizens be counted in state Legislature districts, if the census provides those numbers.\n“I could see that happening, that Republican states might draw their own districts according to citizenship or eligible voters,” Brace said. “They couldn’t change the number of [congressional] seats they get, but within the states they could draw districts that way. The courts have allowed that.”\n\n\n\n \nStateline home page\nSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Alabama Sues To Exclude Undocumented Immigrants From Census Count',
  'body': '\nAlabama is suing the Trump administration to force the Census Bureau not to count undocumented people as part of the decennial tally used to determine how many seats in Congress each state gets.\nThe suit signals a continued conservative interest in changing the way the census counts immigrants.\xa0In a statement, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the plaintiffs in the suit, said apportionment should exclude immigrants\xa0and be based on only the citizen population. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) have made similar calls. Missouri lawmakers are considering legislation to base their state legislative districts based only on citizen population.\nLast week the top official in the Department of Justice’s civil rights division said the Trump administration had “no position” on whether districts should be apportioned based solely on citizen population.\nEvery 10 years, the census counts all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, and that tally is used as the basis to figure out how many congressional seats each state gets. The\xa014th Amendment says congressional seats should be apportioned based on simply the number of “persons.”\nBut in a suit filed Tuesday in federal court in Alabama, Brooks and the state’s Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) argue that in the 18th and 19th centuries, the word “persons” would not have been understood to include undocumented people in the country. They argue that including undocumented immigrants in the count to determine congressional representation unfairly allows states with large undocumented populations to have inflated political representation. Alabama is projected to lose a congressional seat after the next census.\nIn March the Commerce Department announced it would add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census ― the first time it will do so on a decennial survey since 1950. Civil rights groups say including the question will drive down response rates among immigrant groups.\xa0\nThe results of the census have significant consequences; in addition to determining how many House seats each state gets, the count determines how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated.\nThe suit seeks to block a census rule\xa0directing the bureau to count citizens and foreign nationals in the United States at the address where they live or sleep most of the time. The plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the 14th Amendment “by robbing the people of the state of Alabama of their rightful share of political representation while systematically redistributing political powers to states with high numbers of illegal aliens and their citizens.”\nLegal experts and historians cast doubt on the lawsuit’s foundational claim ― that the word “persons”\xa0was previously understood to exclude undocumented immigrants.\nFranita Tolson, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a scholar of the 14th Amendment, said she was “unaware of any historical support” for Alabama’s argument. She said the legislative history surrounding the 14th Amendment shows that those who passed it understood the word “persons” to apply to those ineligible at the time to become citizens.\xa0\n“To say that Alabama’s argument is a stretch is being overly generous,” she wrote in an email. “The text says ‘persons’ and the history illustrates that this term applies broadly.”\nMichael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, noted that the founders added a clause to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution to prevent slaves from being counted as people for the purpose of determining how many congressional seats each state gets. If the Founding Fathers had intended to exclude people illegally in the United States, he said, they could have added a clause to explicitly say so. \nPamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, pointed to information on the website of United States Customs and Immigration Services noting that immigration in the 18th and 19th centuries was “relatively free and open.” It wasn’t until 1875 that the U.S. Supreme Court said the federal government had a responsibility to regulate immigration, and it wasn’t until 1880 that Congress began to enact immigration legislation.\n“At the time of the Founding, there simply wasn’t a category of ‘undocumented’ immigrants,” she wrote in an email.\nJohn Thompson, a former director of the Census Bureau, noted that there is no good way for the census to determine whether people are in the country legally. Census officials, he said, can’t simply walk up to people and ask them if they are legally in the United States and expect to get an accurate count.\nThe suit offers no method for the Census Bureau to count legal immigrants but exclude unauthorized residents.\nMike Lewis, a spokesman for Marshall, dismissed the practical concerns.\n“It is important to know who is here both legally and illegally. Our lawsuit is only focused on the question of counting illegal immigrants in the apportionment portion of the census,” he said in a statement. “There are a variety of proposals that would allow the census to identify immigrants without legal status. \xa0We will address the appropriate remedy in the course of the litigation.”\nJeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues, said the case could go to the Supreme Court. He added that it was “fiction” that the Founding Fathers intended to exclude undocumented people from the census.\xa0 \xa0\n“Whoever filed the suit did not think this through,” he said.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nTrump Administration Decides To Add A Question About Citizenship To 2020 Census\n\n\nTrump Administration’s Justification For A Census Question On Citizenship Appears Shaky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Ireland Votes To Repeal Abortion Amendment In Landslide Referendum',
  'body': '\nIrish voters on Friday repealed the country’s eighth constitutional amendment, a decadeslong ban on abortion that had forced thousands of women to either illegally order abortion pills online or travel to the United Kingdom to access the procedure.\xa0\nA total of 1,429,981 voted for the repeal and 723,632 voted against, Returning Officer Barry Ryan said Saturday.\xa0\nThe landmark referendum heralds a new era for women’s rights in a government that for centuries operated as a theocracy. Ireland’s parliament is now expected to write a more liberal law on the procedure, which will likely allow a woman to complete an abortion until up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe legalization of abortion in Ireland delivers a huge blow to the global anti-abortion movement, which had looked to the Western country’s near-total ban on the procedure as a beacon for other efforts around the world. International religious and anti-abortion groups ― many of them American ― had poured money and resources into a sophisticated digital campaign to uphold the ban in Ireland.\n“What we have seen today is a culmination of a quiet revolution that’s been taking place in Ireland for the past 10 or 20 years. This has been a great exercise in democracy and the people have spoken,”\xa0Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement.\n“The people have said that we want a modern constitution for a modern country and we trust women and we respect them to make the right decisions and the right choices,” he added. “It gives the government the mandate that we need now to bring forward the legislation that we promised and have it through the door ... and enacted before the end of this year.”\nThe moral influence of the Roman Catholic Church is waning in the country. In 2016, Roman Catholics made up 78.3 percent of the Irish population, down from 86.8 percent in 2006. A series of scandals — chief among them the clerical sex abuse revelations in the 1990s — has undermined the church’s authority. A younger generation in Ireland was poised to bring the country’s reproductive rights laws up to speed with most other rich Western nations. \n“It just seems a bit absurd to me that we essentially have abortion in Ireland already,” said Aisling Grace, 20, in an interview three weeks before the vote. “The eighth amendment is a continuation of this Irish culture of burying our heads in the sand,” the student at Trinity College in Dublin added.\xa0\nIreland is one of the richest countries in the world, but since adopting the eighth amendment in 1983 it has banned abortion except to save the life of the mother. This puts it in the unlikely company of countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua, which have some of the world’s most draconian restrictions on reproductive rights. Ireland’s enforcement of the abortion ban was not quite as extreme as El Salvador’s, where a woman might be sentenced to decades in prison for having a miscarriage. But the European nation has denied women abortions even in cases where the pregnancy severely affects the mother’s health.\nThe most infamous case is that of Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old dentist who died in 2012 from complications related to a septic miscarriage. Her medical team had denied her request for an abortion at 17 weeks of pregnancy. But that’s not the only example. Just this year, 30-year-old Claire Malone, who has a congenital heart condition and one lung, was denied an abortion because Irish doctors decided that while her pregnancy was “high risk,” her life was not sufficiently threatened. \nProgressives pointed to these cases in the campaign to liberalize Ireland’s abortion laws, and women across the country used the Facebook page “In Her Shoes” to tell their own harrowing abortion stories. Leaders of the pro-repeal campaign had considered themselves the underdogs since the other side appeared to benefit from a great deal of foreign influence, an international anti-abortion fundraising network and an intense digital targeting effort. \nAdvocates for the repeal\xa0were also fighting a status quo that was wrapped up in certain conceptions of Irish identity. One 65-year-old man in Dublin, who asked HuffPost not to publish his name, said he believed that women should have the legal right to choose abortion, but he was still emotionally conflicted about which way to vote. “There are so few things that make Ireland unique anymore,” he said. “We don’t allow abortions, and our policemen don’t carry guns. If you start changing those things, what incentive would people have to come visit our country?”\nBut pressure to change came from many directions. The United Nations Human Rights Committee began leaning on Ireland in 2017 to reconsider its abortion ban, which it called “cruel and inhumane.” (Until Saturday, Malta was the only other nation in the European Union to outlaw the procedure.) And the U.K.’s Brexit vote in the same year made it unclear whether Irish women would still be able to travel to England as easily to obtain care safely and legally. \nProgressive groups were also bolstered by the fact that Ireland voted to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015. Many of the same activists who had pushed for marriage equality moved on to reproductive rights advocacy with a favorable wind at their backs. \n“Two years ago, we constantly had not only politicians but a lot of political media and those opposed to any progress saying, ‘Nobody’s interested in this. This will go nowhere,’” said Colm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland. “We were able to demonstrate and show and build a very clear call for change.”\nSara Boboltz contributed reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

  'body': '\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The former son-in-law of Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of President Donald Trump’s campaign, has cut a plea deal with the Justice Department that requires him to cooperate with other criminal probes, two people with knowledge of the matter said.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThe guilty plea agreement, which is under seal and has not been previously reported, could add to the legal pressure on Manafort, who is facing two indictments brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nManafort has been indicted in federal courts in Washington and Virginia with charges ranging from tax evasion to bank fraud and has pleaded not guilty to the charges. \xa0\xa0\xa0\nJeffrey Yohai, a former business partner of Manafort, was divorced from Manafort’s daughter last August.\nYohai has not been specifically told how he will be called on to cooperate as part of his plea agreement, but the two people familiar with the matter say they consider it a possibility that he will be asked to assist with Mueller’s prosecution of Manafort.\nLegal experts have said that Mueller wants to keep applying pressure on Manafort to plead guilty and assist prosecutors with their probe. Manafort chaired the Trump campaign for three months before resigning in August 2016.\nBoth Trump and Russia have denied allegations they colluded to help Republican Trump win the election.\nHilary Potashner, a public defender who is representing Yohai, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nManafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, declined to comment.\nAndrew Brown, a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, had been overseeing an investigation into Yohai’s real estate and bank dealings in California and New York several months before Mueller was appointed to his post in May 2017.\nYohai’s agreement, which was concluded early this year, included him pleading guilty to misusing construction loan funds and to a count related to a bank account overdraft.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nWhile the deal was cut with Brown’s office, the federal government “can ask for help at any time,” said one of the people familiar with the matter.\nA spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nMANAFORT TRIAL PENDING\nManafort is to go on trial later this year to fight the two indictments. The charges against him range from failing to disclose lobbying work for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party to bank fraud.\nAs a close business partner, Yohai was privy to many of Manafort’s financial dealings, according to the two people familiar with the matter and court filings in the bankruptcies of four Los Angeles properties in 2016. In addition to co-investing in California real estate, the two cooperated in getting loans for property deals in New York, Manafort’s indictments show.\nMueller sent a team of prosecutors to interview Yohai last June, asking him about Manafort’s relationship with Trump, his ties to Russian oligarchs, and his borrowing of tens of millions of dollars against properties in New York, Reuters reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Gun Reform Advocate Lucy McBath Heads To Runoff For Georgia House Seat',
  'body': '\nGun reform advocate\xa0Lucia “Lucy” McBath\xa0will face businessman Kevin Abel in a Democratic primary runoff in July.\xa0\nThe top contenders in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District primary on Tuesday hope to unseat incumbent Republican Karen Handel in November’s general election.\nWith 99 percent of precincts reporting, McBath amassed an unofficial tally of about 14,700 votes (about 36 percent of the total number) in Tuesday’s primary race, according to The New York Times. Abel had 12,400 votes (30.5 percent).\nMcBath, a national spokeswoman for gun control group Moms Demand Action, was spurred into activism by the death of her son, Jordan Davis, a black 17-year-old who was shot dead in 2012 at a gas station in Florida by a white man complaining about loud music. In her first run for public office, McBath was initially planning to run for a state house seat, but she\xa0pivoted to a run for Congress after the February school shooting in Parkland, Florida,\xa0which killed 17 people ― most of them teens.\n“I knew that I could no longer sit on the sidelines,” McBath wrote on her campaign site, “while the politicians in the pocket of the gun manufacturing lobby decide the future of our gun laws.” \nIf elected to Congress, McBath intends to push for “common sense gun violence prevention laws,” including background checks, raising the age for firearm purchases to 21 years old and fighting against “conceal carry” measures.\nMcBath is not new to politics. As a child,\xa0she\xa0attended civil rights marches\xa0with her father, who was president of the Illinois chapter of the NAACP for over two decades.\xa0More recently, as a “Mother of the Movement” ― a group of women who’ve lost a child to gun violence or in police custody ― McBath has\xa0lobbied Congress,\xa0testified before Senate committees and\xa0campaigned for Hillary\xa0Clinton in 2016. Earlier this year, she\xa0helped plan\xa0the\xa0March for Our Lives\xa0protest.\n“This [campaign] has been my therapy,” McBath\xa0told Refinery29\xa0in late February, of her run for Congress. “This has been the best therapy in the world for me because it makes me feel like Jordan didn’t die in vain, because we can change the culture that he died under.”\nThe two-time breast cancer survivor is also committed to fighting for issues beyond gun control, like affordable health care and women’s access to\xa0health services.\nI’ve lobbied the State House and Senate  to enact common sense gun violence prevention laws that save lives.

 {'title': 'Democrats Plan Big Anti-Corruption Theme For Midterms',
  'body': '\nDemocrats are planning to make Washington corruption a central focus of their midterm messaging, reviving a successful theme from when they took control of Congress in 2006. \nThe anti-corruption push is the second part of Democrats’ “A Better Deal” platform. The first part, released last summer, focused on an economic agenda. The newest part is “A Better Deal for Our Democracy,” which puts forward proposals to increase access to the ballot box, fight special interests and combat big money through campaign finance reform. \nThe new initiative will center on both President Donald Trump’s administration and the culture in Congress that gives access to lobbyists and corporations. Trump’s Cabinet officials, including Environmental Protection Agency leader Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, have drawn a torrent of negative headlines over allegations of unethical behavior, travel practices and ties to special interests. The president’s hotel in downtown D.C., in particular, has been the subject of several lawsuits.\nCongress has to rein in the excesses of the executive branch, Democrats argue, and the current crop of Republican leaders aren’t going to do it. \nDemocrats unveiled their agenda Monday during a press conference on Capitol Hill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were joined by other lawmakers who have been working on these issues, including Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).\n“President Trump has become the swamp and Americans are paying the price. The American people deserve better,” Pelosi said at the press conference, citing the Trump administration’s failure to reduce the price of prescription drugs and its repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations concerning air and water.\nSchumer similarly lamented that Trump had failed to take on the powerful pharmaceutical industry, which is something he promised to do while on the campaign trail.\nThe Senate minority leader also pointed to the president’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as an example of how influence peddling and special interests had consumed the Trump administration. Following the 2016 election, Cohen\xa0leveraged his relationship\xa0with Trump to receive millions of dollars from companies eager for insight into his administration.\n“The swamp has never been more foul than under this president,” Schumer said.\nDemocrats said they would bring accountability and transparency back to Washington by providing aggressive oversight of the Trump administration and by toughening the nation’s campaign finance laws in order to stem the flow of anonymous political spending known as dark money.\n\n\n\n\nKevin Lamarque / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump and\xa0EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\xa0on June 1, 2017, after announcing the U.S.\xa0would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.\xa0\n\n\n\nThis focus on corruption is a revival of the party’s successful messaging from the 2006 elections, when Democrats took control of the House and Senate from Republicans. They hammered away at the GOP’s “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”\nIn that election cycle,\xa0the GOP was besieged by scandals amongst House members. The most famous was the Mark Foley scandal, which involved Republican congressman from Florida sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys.\nWhen that news broke in September 2006, Republicans knew they were doomed. But other scandals had been dripping out bit by bit in the prior months. \n“Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings,”\xa0said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak candidly. “You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended.”\nPelosi has been testing out the anti-corruption message since at least April; for example, she went after Pruitt for being “a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.” \nBut it remains to be seen how much of this push will actually trickle down to the districts. While Democratic candidates have been talking about the tax law and its benefits for big corporations and lobbyists, they so far have not been focusing on Trump and the problems in his administration. It’s rare to hear candidates talk about Trump in swing districts, with much more of the focus there resting on policy issues such as health care and gun control.\nThis article has been updated with comment from Monday’s press conference.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'All The Things The NRA Has Blamed For The Texas School Shooting',
  'body': '\nIt’s been a week since the mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, and the National Rifle Association has had time to make sense of why, exactly, this happened.\nIt’s because of an abundance of doors. And junk food. And not believing in God.\nThese are the things the NRA has blamed for 10 people being killed and 13 people being injured in last week’s massacre. Not once did the gun rights group raise concerns over the shooter’s easy access to firearms ― the 17-year-old student just used his dad’s guns ― or acknowledge that school shootings are now happening with such frequency in America that kids are developing post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe Texas shooting was the 16th school shooting this year. Another\xa0school shooting took place while this article was being written.\nBut the NRA says guns aren’t the problem.\xa0Here’s a look at all the other things the group has said are the reasons for the horrifying uptick in gun violence at schools.\n\n\n\n\nLoren Elliott / Reuters\n\n\nA student mourns those killed in the recent shooting at Santa Fe High School.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nA “culture of violence”\nIncoming NRA president Oliver North said the solution to mass shootings at schools is to focus on the “disease,” which is not about easy access to guns.\n“The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” North said on Fox News Sunday. “They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases.”\nGodlessness\nNRATV host Grant Stinchfield said it’s helpful to offer “thoughts and prayers” after every mass shooting because it brings God back into the discussion.\xa0\n“Taking God out of our culture ... is at least partly to blame for the violence we see today,” he said on his Monday show.\nToo many doors in schools\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a fierce opponent of gun control, said the Santa Fe shooting may have been caused by schools having “too many entrances” and that it may be time “to look at the design of our schools moving forward.”\nNRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch tweeted that Patrick is “exactly right.”\nUnhealthy diets\nNRA board member Ted Nugent said Tuesday that kids’ unhealthy diets are making them want to shoot up their schools.\n“Mark my words when the studies are finalized, you will find that Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, certainly Sandy Hook, these maniac murderers in Parkland and now Santa Fe, if you really studied the slovenliness and the zombie-like conduct of these murderers, you go back to their diet and examine what they’ve put into their sacred temple, and it’s all garbage,” Nugent said in an interview on Newsmax TV, a conservative media outlet.\n“I know people think I’m trying to get away from the gun issue, but it’s not a gun issue,” he added. “It is a conduct issue.”\nRitalin\nNorth said the combination of kids growing up in a violent culture and then taking medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is causing a spike in school shootings.\n“They have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,”\xa0he said\xa0on Fox News Sunday. “If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.”\nThe overmedication of children\n“The problems that are producing scores of isolated young disturbed children who have convinced themselves that murdering their classmates is the way to get attention will not be solved at the gun store. It is in the home,” Loesch said Tuesday\xa0on an NRATV segment titled “The Overmedication of Children Is an Epidemic.”\n“It’s about the kind of people we’re raising these kids to become,” she said.\n“Progressive culture”\nNRATV commentator Colion Noir said loose gun laws aren’t the problem behind school shootings. It’s America’s progressive culture.\n“When are we going to be completely honest and acknowledge the awkward, bullied, sexually frustrated, psychotropic drug-laced, suicidal, mass shooters in the room for what they are?” he said on a Sunday NRATV segment. “Or are we just going to keep acting like we don’t know what’s going on in the name of not confronting the miserable reality that they are a creation of our so-called progressive culture and media?”\nCriticizing masculinity as toxic\nIn the same segment, Noir blamed school shootings on parents failing to teach their kids “how to cope with the harsh realities of life.”\n“We shield them in safe spaces and give them participation trophies incentivizing mediocrity, and tell our young boys that their masculinity is toxic and our young girls that being a woman means acting like a man, further confusing the hell out of kids who are naturally going to struggle with their identity as is,” said Noir.\nMainstream media\nNRATV host Grant Stinchfield said Monday that mainstream media outlets “wrote the mass shooters playbook.”\n“I place some of the blame on the #MSM.\xa0They recruit new players to their dark real life mass shooting reality show,” he tweeted.\n',

 {'title': 'Here’s What Happens When A Catholic Hospital Won’t Try To Save You',
  'body': '\nThe Trump administration is poised to hand religious conservatives another victory: a slew of new federal rules that would give religious health care providers wide latitude to refuse to treat patients or perform procedures if doing so would violate their religious beliefs.\nSome of the most powerful hospital networks in the country have lobbied for these “conscience” rules, claiming they shouldn’t fear a legal risk for practicing medicine according to their religious beliefs. But those same hospital networks are already using religious justifications to place women in life-threatening situations with impunity, documents obtained by HuffPost show.\nAt a hospital owned by Ascension, the largest Catholic hospital network in the country and a staunch proponent of a rule that would give nearly any health care worker the right to refuse care, doctors refused to intervene as a woman was undergoing a life-threatening miscarriage because they believed that doing so would be the same as performing an abortion, the documents show. Instead, they carted her out to the hospital parking lot so a relative could drive her to a different emergency room, where she underwent a massive blood transfusion and emergency surgery. \nAscension, which operates more than 150 hospitals according to these same religious principles, also runs a hospital where doctors refused to perform a tubal ligation, even though the patient was at risk of dying if she ever became pregnant again. And at hospitals controlled by Trinity Health, a network that manages nearly 100 care centers around the Midwest, multiple women have accused doctors of withholding emergency medicine because it violated their prohibitions on certain kinds of reproductive health care.\nOne of the new rules, which the Trump administration proposed in January but has not finalized, would limit patients’ and advocates’ ability to protest these incidents. The rules would broaden and define the legal right of virtually any health care worker, from surgeons to nursing home attendants to receptionists, to refuse to provide or facilitate medical services that go against their personal religious beliefs or their employer’s.\nThe reach of the new guidelines would be widespread. The American health care system relies heavily on Catholic and other religiously affiliated hospitals. Around 1 out of every 6 hospital beds in the U.S. is located in a Catholic facility, according to a 2016 report. That means for many Americans, the closest hospital is one that might refuse to treat them.\nThat’s what happened on Oct. 25, 2012, when a woman arrived at St. John Hospital and Medical Center of Detroit in an ambulance. The woman was between 17 and 23 weeks pregnant — a point where an infant would not survive outside the womb — and in the midst of a miscarriage. Her condition was life-threatening and indicated that she needed an emergency termination to prevent the risk of bleeding to death, according to a complaint later filed by a medical staffer at another hospital.\n\nI’m not sure why you’re here. We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.\nA doctor at a Detroit hospital to a woman in need of emergency treatment, according to a filed complaint\n\nDoctors at St. John recognized they would not be able to prevent the death of the woman’s fetus. But they refused to offer her emergency intervention. \n“I’m not sure why you’re here,” a doctor at St. John told the woman, according to the complaint. “We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.”\nFor a hospital, failing to try to stabilize a patient in a medical emergency is a violation of federal law. St. John broke this rule, then violated regulations again when it failed\xa0to transfer the woman to another hospital, federal investigators determined. When the woman left St. John,\xa0her heart rate was elevated and she was bleeding so much that staff were constantly cleaning blood off her body, according to documents from the investigation. But instead of calling an ambulance, St. John staff gave her directions to another hospital, placed her in a wheelchair and wheeled her into the parking lot. An unidentified woman then drove her away.\n“I think it was her mom or her aunt,” one staff member told an investigator. “I just saw her get into a car with a woman. Do you know if she got care at [the other hospital] and if she is OK?”\nIn fact, once the woman arrived at Hutzel Women’s Hospital, she\xa0had a miscarriage and underwent emergency surgery to stop a “massive hemorrhage,” according to notes from the investigation. The woman had to be hospitalized for three days. \nSeveral weeks later, a staff member at Hutzel filed a complaint about the woman’s treatment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for “multiple episodes of poor care.” “It seems inconceivable that a major hospital with labor and delivery services lacks the ability to care for a pregnant patient who is having a miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage,” wrote the staff member, who is unidentified in the documents. “I believe that further investigation into these events is warranted to determine... why she received improper management of her life-threatening condition. She is interested in understanding also.”\nIn an interview with a federal investigator, a St. John staff member said, “We are a Catholic institution and we do not perform abortions here if there are fetal heart tones.” All of Ascension’s hospitals adhere to a set of ethical guidelines written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that bans abortion services or “material cooperation” in an abortion. The guidelines do allow doctors to perform certain procedures as long as the primary goal is not to terminate the pregnancy but to save the life of the mother. But in practice, many Catholic hospitals place a blanket ban on any procedure they consider an abortion.\nAscension is not the only Catholic health care system pressing the Trump administration to protect it from consequences for risking patients’ lives. Trinity Health, which has lobbied the Trump administration to dismantle an Affordable Care Act rule prohibiting gender discrimination, owns and operates several hospitals that have been accused of violating federal laws requiring hospitals to provide patients with basic care. One woman accused a Trinity hospital of refusing to remove her intrauterine device, which had been dislodged when she fell down, causing her weeks of pain.\nMercy Health Partners in Michigan, which Trinity owns, risked the lives of five women who were having dangerous miscarriages by failing to offer a kind of medical intervention the hospital considered to be abortion,\xa0a whistleblower told federal authorities. All of the women suffered potentially fatal infections for which the typical treatment is to hasten the miscarriage. The whistleblower later reported three more cases where medical records suggested the hospital withheld certain treatment options because of its Catholic affiliation, according to federal records obtained by HuffPost. \nA spokesperson for Mercy Health Partners declined to comment. Ascension did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nReligiously affiliated hospitals already rarely face consequences for refusing to provide treatments. Under former President Barack Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services made a brief and perfunctory threat to suspend St. John’s right to participate in Medicare, but dropped it once St. John took “corrective action.” Trinity Health did not receive any major citations for breaking any laws after federal investigators received the complaints about Mercy. And courts have dismissed a string of lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for refusing reproductive health care. \nWith the new rules in place, they could enjoy even more protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Called sensates, they share both wisdom and emotions with each other. At first this is confusing to everyone involved, but then the group learns to work together.\nThis bonus episode is more about the challenges of having this gift and the enemies these sensates have to physically fight to stay together.\nMore About This:\xa0After Netflix canceled “Sense8,” the show’s fervent fan base made enough of an uproar to get the company to bring the show back from the dead. At least, sort of.\nThis is just a multi-hour special that will wrap up the series with a more purposeful ending.\nThe Wachowskis and J. Michael Straczynski created the show.\xa0\nRuntime: 2 hours, 31 minutes\nTrailer:\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“The Staircase”\nDocuseries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsUp/Netflix\n\n\n“The Staircase” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 8, 2018\nPremise:\xa0An in-depth look at the storylines surrounding a potential murder. The show focuses on the trial of American crime novelist Michael Peterson, who faced accusations that he killed his second wife.\nPeterson maintains that his wife fell down the stairs, while the prosecution tries to prove that the injuries on her body don’t make sense under that scenario.\nMore About This:\xa0Parts of this series originally aired on other cable channels, starting in 2004. New developments in the case have occurred, so there are updates and new episodes debuting here, along with the initial series.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx.\xa045 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\xa0\n“Queer Eye”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n“Queer Eye” on Netflix.\n\n\n\nRelease Date:\xa0June 15, 2018\n\nPremise:\xa0Five queer men who are experts in their respective fields try to transform various individuals’ lives for the better. This typically involves makeovers in style, beauty, home design, personality and kind-of-sort-of cooking. (The show tends to teach the most rudimentary cooking basics.)\nMuch of the focus is on transforming the lives of “real Americans,” with the five urbanites essentially parachuting into Southern communities.\nMore About This:\xa0The cast filmed the second season at the same time as Season 1. As such,\xa0this might as well be considered Season 1, Part 2. If you liked the initial episodes, you’ll probably like these too.\nRuntime: Eight episodes of approx. 45 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a music video with Betty Who):\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Set It Up”\nMovie\n\n\n\n\n\nKC Bailey/Netflix\n\n\n“Set It Up” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 15, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Two overworked assistants in their 20s try to set their bosses up romantically. The two believe that if their bosses are dating, then they won’t assign as much work, given their newfound happiness.\nAs you can expect, through the shenanigans of figuring out how to make two people fall in love, these two beautiful young people start having feelings for each other.\nMore About This:\xa0The show has a cool cast. The two main characters are played by up-and-coming actors, Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell, who were in the 2016 Richard Linklater movie “Everybody Wants Some!!” That movie seems to have more and more of a cult status every year and it’s nice to see two of the main actors show up together again in something else.\nThe show also features Titus Burgess and Pete Davidson, and the two bosses are played by Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs.\nRuntime: TBA\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Marvel’s Luke Cage”\nShow\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Lee/Netflix\n\n\n“Luke Cage” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 22, 2018\nPremise:\xa0A man, Luke Cage, gets super strength and unbreakable skin through an experiment gone awry. This allows him to fairly easily fight crime in his Harlem neighborhood.\xa0Cage is impervious to bullets, so the common criminal can’t stop him. And as he takes down more and more criminals,\xa0Cage becomes a national sensation as well as a hometown hero.\nThen another invincible seeming person challenges him and Cage must learn the limits of his strength.\nMore About This:\xa0This is part of Netflix’s mini Marvel universe, along with the characters Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Iron Fist. Luke Cage appeared with these characters in the very popular “The Defenders” in late 2017.\nRuntime: 13 episodes of approx. 55 minutes\nTrailer:\xa0\n\n\n\n\n“Glow”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Parise/Netflix\n\n\n“Glow” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 29, 2018\nPremise:\xa0This is based on the true story of the “Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” circuit from the 1980s. Along with the mega-rise of male-dominated professional wrestling entertainment with stars like Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair, this female league found niche success throughout America.\nThe show focuses on a struggling actress who finds a role as one of the wrestling stars.\nMore About This:\xa0One of the breakout 2017 Netflix shows, this has certainly been good for the careers of the two stars, Alison Brie and Marc Maron.\nRuntime: 10 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (sort of, it’s a lip-sync with the cast):\n\n\n\n\n“Nailed It!”\nShow\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\n“Nailed It!” on Netflix.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Date: June 19, 2018\nPremise:\xa0Inexperienced bakers compete to try and recreate professionally made confections. This tends to end in hilariously terrible looking cakes.\nThe winners get $10,000.\nThe losers get mocked endlessly on social media, but all in good fun.\nMore About This:\xa0The first season debuted on March 9, so much like the “second season” of “Queer Eye” this month, this kind of just feels like part two of the first season. That’s especially so in this case, as both seasons of “Nailed It!” are just six episodes.\nCalling this a second season is definitely inventive marketing.\nRuntime: 6 episodes of approx. 30 minutes\nTrailer (from Season 1):\n\n\n\xa0\nAnd here’s the full list (so far) of shows and movies joining Netflix in June.\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Abruptly Cancels North Korea Summit With Kim Jong Un',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday canceled a scheduled June 12 summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after recent sparring between the two countries over the planned nuclear talks.\n“Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,” Trump wrote in a letter to Kim, which was sent to reporters.\nRead Trump’s letter (story continues below):\n Trump Letter by Anonymous FBZLGr on Scribd\nSouth Korean officials appeared blindsided by the announcement.\n“We are attempting to make sense of what, precisely, President Trump means,” said spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom, according to The Washington Post’s Anna Fifield.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-In urged both Trump and Kim to hold direct talks, South Korea’s\xa0Yonhap News Agency reported.\nIt’s also unclear whether State Department officials were aware of Trump’s decision before he released the letter. When asked if the announcement came as a surprise, a staffer in the office that works on North Korea issues said he had to check with State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert.\nSpeaking at the White House later Thursday, Trump said he had just spoken with military officials, as well as the leaders of South Korea and Japan. They are “ready for foolish or reckless acts be taken by North Korea,” he said, adding that “an unfortunate situation is forced upon us.”\n“Hopefully positive things will be taking place with respect to the future of North Korea. If they don’t, we are more ready than we have ever been before,” he said, apparently a threat of military action.\nOn a call with reporters, a senior White House official asserted that Trump “had constant communication with our allies,” but did not explain why U.S. allies were caught off guard. The official did not say whether Trump and Kim had spoken directly.\nOf the letter, the official said Trump had “dictated every word himself.”\nTrump’s announcement came hours after North Korean officials threatened to cancel the summit,\xa0angered by recent comments from Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton, who compared North Korea with Libya.\n\n\n\n\nKCNA KCNA / Reuters\n\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks\xa0at a meeting in Pyongyang on May 18.\n\n\n\nNorth Korean officials view Libya as a cautionary tale and called Bolton’s remarks “awfully sinister.” After Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons program in 2003, an armed revolution aided by a U.S. and NATO military intervention ousted him in 2011. Rebel forces captured and brutally killed Gaddafi during the conflict.\n“World knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fate,” a senior North Korean official said in a statement\xa0this month.\nEarlier Thursday, North Korea announced that it had destroyed tunnels at what they say is the country’s only nuclear test site. Trump did not acknowledge the concession in his letter.\nThe senior White House official said there was no way to confirm whether the tunnels had been destroyed because only a select group of foreign journalists had witnessed the process. No nuclear experts or monitors were present to inspect the site.\nCracks began to emerge in plans for the summit last week, after North Korea threatened to call off the meeting if the Trump administration demanded the country completely denuclearize. Trump appeared to soften his rhetoric\xa0toward North Korea this week, saying that a more gradual option of denuclearization was a possibility.\nBut he teased the summit’s uncertain fate.\n\n“We’re moving along. We’ll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting,” Trump told reporters Tuesday, without specifying what those conditions would be.\n\n\nThe next day,\xa0Trump told Fox News there was a “good chance” the summit would take place.\nTrump, in his remarks Thursday, suggested that the summit could still happen “at some later date.”\n“Hopefully everything will work out well with North Korea,” he said. “A lot of things can happen.”\nTrump had touted the renewed diplomacy with North Korea as a triumph for his administration,\xa0suggesting that he should win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.\nThe White House push for negotiations in recent months was a dramatic shift from Trump’s initial posture toward North Korea. Last year, Trump and Kim were locked in an escalating battle of insults, which included Trump threatening North Korea with “fire and fury” if the country took action against the United States.\nJessica Schulberg and Akbar Ahmed contributed reporting.\n\nThis article has been updated to include Trump’s comments and information from a call with reporters.\xa0\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div class="advertisement sharebox_260x60" data-placement="sharebox_260x60" data-yaft-module="huffpost-sharebox_260x60"&gt;\n&lt;div class="ad_share_box"&gt;\n&lt;div style="display:none;line-height:normal;font:0.6em sans-serif;color:#909090;" class="sharebox-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;#ad_sharebox_260x60 img {padding:0;margin:0;}&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div id="ad_sharebox_260x60" class="ad_wrapper" style="padding:0;background:none;"&gt;&lt;div id="adtech_sharebox_260x60" class="adtech-adspot ad-sharebox_260x60"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function() {\n  var adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'#adtech_sharebox_260x60\');\n  adsDiv.removeAttribute(\'id\');\n  // enableQueue: ""\n  \n    \n      \n        waitForGlobal(function() {\n          return window.htmlAdWH &amp;&amp; window.adSetSyncCalled;\n        }, function() {\n          // override adsPl in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetPlId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.origAdsPlId = window.adsPl; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origAdsPlId) { window.adSetPlId(window.origAdsPlId); }\n            \n          }\n\n          // override ads NetId in template\n          if (\'function\' === typeof window.adSetNetId) {\n            if (\'undefined\' === typeof window.origNetId) { window.origNetId = window.adsNt; }\n            if (\'undefined\' !== typeof window.origNetId) { window.adSetNetId(window.origNetId); }\n            \n          }\n          \n          adsDiv.reloadCount = 0;\n          var recoveryId = \'\';\n          var needsRecovery = recoveryId &amp;&amp; recoveryId.length &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock &amp;&amp; kraken__adBlock.active;\n          var adId = needsRecovery ? recoveryId : \'93415675\';\n          try { adId = io_c3sd.ads["sharebox_260x60"] || adId; } catch(e) {}\n\n          \n          \n          // Override adtech_call_type\n          var delivery_type = "default" || "";\n          var adtech_call_type = "";\n          switch (delivery_type) {\n            case "by_request": adtech_call_type = "ajax"; break;\n            case "text": adtech_call_type = "text"; break;\n            case "iframe": adtech_call_type = "iframe"; break;\n            case "iframe_proxy": adtech_call_type = "f"; break;\n            case "collapsed": adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n            default: adtech_call_type = "fc"; break;\n          }\n\n          \n          \n          \n          var args = [\'260\', \'60\'];\n\n          \n          \n\n          if(needsRecovery) {\n            waitForGlobal(\'readyToRecover\', function() {\n              adsDiv = document.querySelector(\'.sharebox_260x60\');\n              //htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], "fileless", adsDiv);\n            });\n          } else {\n            htmlAdWH(adId, args[0], args[1], adtech_call_type, adsDiv);\n          }\n          \n          if (typeof debugadcode == \'function\') { debugadcode(\'AdTech\', {placement: \'sharebox_260x60\', mnid: adId}, adsDiv); }\n          \n          waitForGlobal(\'jQuery\', function() {\n            jQuery(document).on(\'reloadAd\', function(ev, elem) {\n              if (elem &amp;&amp; !elem.contains(adsDiv)) { return; }\n              var refreshRate = 1;  \n              adsDiv.reloadCount++;\n              if (adsDiv.reloadCount % refreshRate === 0 &amp;&amp; typeof adsReloadAd === \'function\') { adsReloadAd(adsDiv); }\n            });\n          });\n              \n          adSetInView(\'0\');\n        }); // wFG:htmlAdWH\n      \n    \n   //modulous queue closing\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n(function(){\nvar box = document.getElementById(\'ad_sharebox_260x60\').parentNode;\nvar label = box.querySelector(\'.sharebox-label\');\nfunction resize() {\n  var ifr = box.querySelector(\'iframe\');\n  if ((!ifr &amp;&amp; box.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; box.offsetHeight &gt; 10) || \n      (ifr &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetWidth &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; ifr.offsetHeight &gt; 10)) {\n    box.style.paddingBottom = \'5px\';\n    box.style.marginRight = \'20px\';\n    label.style.display = \'\';\n  } else {\n    label.style.display = \'none\';\n    box.style.marginRight = box.style.paddingBottom = \'\';\n  }\n}\nfor (i=0; i&lt;10000; i+= 500) { window.setTimeout(resize, i); }\n}());\n&lt;/scr+ipt&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Party Chairman Tom Perez Faces Criticism Inside DNC For Endorsing Andrew Cuomo',
  'body': '\nSeveral members of the Democratic National Committee slammed Chairman Tom Perez’s Thursday endorsement of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a two-term incumbent fending off a major left-wing primary challenge.\nThe members,\xa0who said Perez had neglected to inform them of the decision, argued that it would undermine efforts to earn the trust of progressives, young voters and independents already suspicious of the DNC for its role in the 2016 presidential primary.\n“I was like, ‘Is he crazy?’ What does he think the response is going to be from progressives who already had doubts about the DNC?” said Yasmine Taeb, a Virginia Democratic National Committeewoman.\nA senior Democratic official and DNC member, who declined to be named for professional reasons, called it an “unforced error.”\n“Every misstep like this results in us having to spend a lot of time cleaning up the mess and repairing bridges and rebuilding trust,” the official said.\xa0\nPerez’s endorsement of Cuomo was “personal” and not a reflection of the DNC’s preference, according to Xochitl Hinojosa, his chief spokeswoman at the DNC.\xa0\n“This was not an endorsement by the DNC, nor will the DNC be using resources toward this primary,” Hinojosa said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal or not, the move has elicited criticism within the DNC’s ranks at a time when the party is seeking to form a united front for the November elections. Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb, veteran DNC member Jim Zogby,\xa0California Committeeman Michael Kapp and Missouri Committeeman Curtis Wylde condemned the action in similar terms.\nThey join Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a deputy DNC chair whom Perez did not inform of the endorsement in advance. Ellison, a national progressive leader, publicly broke with Perez, reiterating his commitment to the DNC’s absolute neutrality in elections.\nOther members, including Kansas Committeeman Chris Reeves, Missouri Democratic Party Vice Chairwoman Genevieve Williams and DNC Black Caucus Chairwoman Virgie Rollins questioned the wisdom of Perez’s endorsement but stopped short of explicitly condemning him. The chairs of the Michigan, South Carolina and Texas Democratic parties declined to comment on the matter.\nThe displeasure with Perez’s decision to endorse Cuomo reflects a simmering divide between the party’s centrist-leaning “establishment” and its progressive wing. The progressive base is disproportionately,\xa0though not exclusively,\xa0made up of supporters of Ellison’s bid for DNC chair in February 2017 and for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run for the Democratic presidential nomination.\xa0\nThese progressive Democrats were critical of the DNC for its partiality toward Hillary Clinton in the primary, including its far-reaching joint fundraising agreement with her campaign months before she had won the nomination.\n\nIt was another instance of a party chair who promised to act differently behaving as every previous party chair would, which is do what they want and not tell anybody about it.\nJim Zogby, veteran Democratic National Committee member\n\nPerez’s announcement rankled them because they fear it undercuts the work they have done to reassure progressives that reform efforts are bearing fruit ― and because it explicitly contradicts Perez’s public statements vowing neutrality in primaries.\n“It was another instance of a party chair who promised to act differently behaving as every previous party chair would, which is do what they want and not tell anybody about it,” said Zogby, who also serves as president of the Arab-American Institute.\nIt doesn’t help matters that the New York primary, which concludes in September, resembles a replay of the Clinton-Sanders contest. Cuomo, whom Clinton endorsed the same day as Perez, is the object of unbridled scorn among much of the progressive base; his challenger, actress Cynthia Nixon, has seemingly elicited an equivalent level of progressive enthusiasm. And Cuomo’s critics point out that he is not even a loyal partisan, having reportedly propped up the breakaway faction of state Democrats that helped Republicans control the New York state Senate for over five years.\nThe dynamics of the race make it that much more likely that Perez’s involvement will dredge up internecine battles that the party would sooner set aside ahead of the general elections in November.\n“Five months before the election, we shouldn’t have to be re-litigating these battles and yet here we are, having to clean up this mess, because Tom stepped right into it,” the senior Democrat said.\nNot all proponents of party reform line up neatly into the Ellison-Sanders camp.\xa0For example, Kapp backed Ellison in 2017 but had endorsed Clinton in the 2016 primary.\nKapp emphasized that he had a “good working relationship” with Perez but believes that the endorsement “detracts” from Perez’s accomplishments at the organization by feeding activist mistrust in the party.\n“It’s not a positive for our party, especially as we are trying to rebuild and expand,” Kapp said.\nIn March, Perez distanced himself from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect Democrats to the House, for publishing opposition research about a progressive candidate running for an open Texas House seat. “I wouldn’t have done it,” he said at the time.\nHinojosa implied that Perez’s “personal endorsement” of Cuomo was still consistent with his criticism of the DCCC’s more aggressive intervention in the Texas primary.\n“The DNC will not be getting involved in contested primaries,” she said. “And the DNC certainly won’t be attacking any fellow Democrats running.”\nEven if Perez had endorsed Cuomo in his official capacity, he would not be violating a written neutrality agreement signed by all DNC officers.\xa0The accord allows officers to endorse incumbent elected officials ― a privilege that some officers avail themselves of, while others do not.\xa0\nPerez likely found himself in a tough position, risking upsetting the progressive part of the party if he jumped in, and alienating donors and many New York Democratic officials if he sat it out.\nNearly all of the nine DNC members who spoke to HuffPost were nonetheless baffled by Perez’s decision, noting that Perez’s blessing likely added little to Cuomo’s already-strong chances of winning. They also maintained that DNC officers generally limit themselves to endorsing in primaries in their home state, where local politics may necessitate it.\xa0\nBut Perez, who was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, has lived in Montgomery County, Maryland, for at least two decades.\xa0\nInstead, the “personal endorsement” was based on Perez’s long-standing relationships with Cuomo and Lt. Gov Kathy Hochul, whom he also endorsed, as well as his “personal ties” to New York dating back to his upbringing, according to Hinojosa.\nThe explanation is not likely to assuage the concerns of Perez’s skeptics who sense that progressive DNC officers and members are held to a higher standard than the party’s more moderate leaders.\xa0\nFor example, Ellison has repeatedly turned down requests to endorse Democrats in his ideological mold ― like Marie Newman, who nearly unseated Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) in March.\nEllison even waited for the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party to endorse his son Jeremiah’s bid for Minneapolis City Council before doing so himself.\nGiven the public nature of Perez’s endorsement of Cuomo\xa0― even if it was a personal statement ― Virgie Rollins, the DNC Black Caucus chairwoman, wondered whether it would remain possible to convince other DNC members not to make endorsements of any kind in primaries.\xa0\n“The question is going to come up: Are we endorsing now in the primary?” Rollins said.\n',

 {'title': '‘Trump’s Son Should Be Concerned’: FBI Obtained Wiretaps Of Putin Ally Who Met With Trump Jr.',
  'body': '\nThe FBI has obtained secret wiretaps collected by Spanish police of conversations involving Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia’s Central Bank who has forged close ties with U.S. lawmakers and the National Rifle Association,\xa0that led to a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. during the gun lobby’s annual convention in Louisville, Ky., in May 2016, a top Spanish prosecutor said Friday.\nJosé Grinda, who has spearheaded investigations into\xa0Spanish organized crime,\xa0said that bureau officials in recent months requested and were provided transcripts of wiretapped conversations between Torshin and Alexander Romanov, a convicted Russian money launderer. On the wiretaps, Romanov refers to Torshin as “El Padrino,” the godfather.\n“Just a few months ago, the wiretaps of these telephone conversations were given to the FBI,” Grinda said in response to a question from Yahoo News during a talk he gave at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. Asked if he was concerned about Torshin’s meetings with Donald Trump Jr. and other American political figures, Grinda replied: “Mr. Trump’s son should be concerned.”\nThe comments by Grinda were the first clear sign that the FBI may be investigating Torshin, possibly as a part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Torshin — a close political ally of Vladimir Putin — had multiple contacts with conservative activists in the United States during the election, seeking to set up a summit between the Russian president and then candidate Trump. Although the summit never transpired, Torshin did meet briefly with the president’s son at a private dinner in Louisville during the May 2016 annual convention of the NRA. A member of the NRA since 2012, Torshin has been a regular attendee of the group’s conventions in recent years and hosted senior members of the group in Moscow.\nGrinda said that the FBI, in its request for the evidence to the Guardia Civil, the Spanish National Police, provided no explanation as to why it was interested in the material and he didn’t ask for one. “I don’t have to ask them why they want this information,” he said. But Grinda added that if Mueller or any other U.S. prosecutor seeks to use the material as part of a court case, they would have to make a second, more formal request to do so to the Spanish government.\nSpokesmen for the FBI and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said he was in a meeting and was unable to comment when contacted by Yahoo News.\n\n\n\n\nAFP Contributor via Getty Images\n\n\n\nTorshin has been the subject of intensifying U.S. government and congressional scrutiny over the past year and was recently among a lengthy list of oligarchs and Russian political figures sanctioned by the Treasury Department. As reported by Yahoo News and the Spanish newspaper El País last year, the Spanish National Police were preparing to arrest Torshin in August 2013, when he was expected to fly to the Spanish island of Mallorca in August for the birthday party of Romanov. The arrest plan, which involved the deployment of more than a dozen police officers at the airport and at the hotel where the party was supposed to take place, grew out of a lengthy investigation headed by Grinda into Russian organized crime and money laundering. As part of the probe, the Guardia Civil wiretapped Romanov’s phone and picked up 33 conversations with Torshin.\nBut Torshin never showed up for the party and he was never arrested. Grinda confirmed in an interview after his talk that some in the Guardia Civil suspected that Torshin had been tipped off to the arrest plan by Russian officials who had been asked to cooperate in the Spanish probe. But Grinda added that he was unable to prove that was why Torshin never showed up for the party.\nDespite the suspicions about his ties to Russian money laundering, Torshin continued to travel frequently to the United States and even showed up as part of a Russian delegation in February 2017 to the National Prayer Breakfast, where he was at one point scheduled to meet with President Trump. (The meeting was canceled the night before, after National Security Council officials raised concerns about it.) More recently, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden sent multiple letters to the NRA asking about its ties to Torshin and other Russian figures, questioning whether Russian money was funneled to the NRA to help pay for the more than $30 million the group spent on political ads and get out the vote efforts during the 2016 election.\nAn NRA lawyer, in responses to Wyden, said that Torshin has only paid his membership dues to the group and that, based on an internal review, the NRA received a total of only $2,500 from about 23\xa0Russia-linked contributors\xa0since 2015. However, the NRA is now reviewing its relationship with Torshin in light of the Treasury Department blacklisting him last month. “Based on Mr. Torshin’s listing as a specially designated national as of April 6, we are currently reviewing our responsibilities with respect to him,” NRA general counsel John Frazer wrote to Wyden.\nAn NRA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\nObama cyber chief: Iran may ramp up cyberattacks after Trump ditched nuclear deal\nMcCain’s legacy: Principles tempered by political necessity\nThe Newest Deal: Dems build a progressive platform for 2020\n\nThis story was originally published on Yahoo News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Mitch McConnell Taps Anti-LGBTQ Bigot For Religious Freedom Panel',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― One of the most prominent anti-LGBTQ leaders in the country is now a federal appointee shaping U.S. policy on religious freedom, thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council ― which the Southern Poverty Law Center\xa0considers a hate group\xa0― announced Wednesday that McConnell appointed him to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. It’s a two-year term, and his responsibilities include “monitor[ing] the universal right to freedom of religion or belief abroad” and making policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state and Congress.\n“I am grateful to Majority Leader McConnell for appointing me to this prestigious position,” Perkins said in a statement. “It is my hope that through the work of USCIRF, the world will become one step closer to recognizing the vital role religious freedom and the defense of religious minorities play in peace, security and human flourishing.”\nPerkins brings to the commission a long record of condemning and denying rights to LGBTQ people, which he and other conservatives like Vice President Mike Pence have been doing for years\xa0in the name of religious freedom.\nHe claimed\xa0in 2010 that the high suicide rate among gay teenagers is not because of societal homophobia, but because they know they are “abnormal.” That same year, Perkins described Uganda’s so-called “kill the gays” bill, which imposed the death penalty for homosexuality, as an effort to “uphold moral conduct.”\nIn 2014, he warned that an anti-Christian holocaust was imminent and said LGBTQ advocates were “going to start rolling out the boxcars to start hauling off Christians.”\nPerkins was behind an unsuccessful effort in 2016 to insert the debunked practice of “gay conversion therapy” into the Republican Party platform. He’s compared the practice to saving someone from a burning building.\nIn 2017, Perkins authored a letter signed by evangelical leaders calling on President Donald Trump to reverse Obama-era guidance allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military. He also co-authored a report with Pence\xa0in an effort to justify the ban on transgender troops.\n\n\n\n\nScott J. Ferrell via Getty Images\n\n\nHere’s Tony Perkins, second from right, with then-Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) in 2006, right after the House\xa0rejected a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. They were both sad about that.\n\n\n\nHere’s Perkins\xa0in 2011 describing people who advocate for LGBTQ rights: “They’re intolerant. They’re hateful. They’re vile. They’re spiteful. Our response to them should be one of love... But let me tell you what, it’s not love to be silent in the face of those who are advancing an agenda that is both destructive to our society and, more importantly, destructive to the individuals involved. To me, that is the height of hatred.”\nIn that same speech,\xa0he said LGBTQ rights advocates are “pawns” of Satan (!).\nPerkins’ record gives some insight into the kinds of recommendations he might now make to Trump regarding countries where LGBTQ people are oppressed in the name of religion.\nThe White House also just appointed evangelical activist Gary Bauer to the commission.\xa0Bauer has said that LGBTQ rights will lead to “the criminalization of Christianity,” and claimed that gay people will try to take children away from parents who don’t agree with same-sex marriage.\nLGBTQ rights groups are horrified by their appointments.\xa0\n“In their America, LGBTQ people would be forced to hide who they are or face criminal sanction, their relationships would be unrecognized, their children could be taken away and LGBTQ youth would face harmful conversion therapy,” said Human Rights Campaign spokeswoman Charlotte Clymer, who used to write about social justice issues for HuffPost’s open blog platform.\n“For the Trump-Pence White House to nominate them to this position is insulting to our core American values and ignores the reality of the vast majority of Americans who believe religious freedom and equality are not only compatible but essential in 21st Century America,” she said.\nMcConnell spokesman Don Stewart had no comment.\nHe indicated the\xa0office typically does not comment on appointments made directly by McConnell as opposed to those made by the full Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Vietnam Is A Test For What Happens When The U.S. Abandons Climate Diplomacy',
  'body': '\nHANOI, Vietnam ― There was a time, a little over two years ago, when Ted Osius could imagine the smog clearing over this sprawling capital city, with its jungle canopy of ancient banyan trees and electrical wires alive with coal-fired power and its throngs of exhaust-coughing motorbikes.\nOsius, who abruptly resigned late last year after three years as the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, now warns that the Trump administration’s retreat on climate change is encouraging Vietnam to dig in on coal power. Doing so would undermine years of progress in a country that, with 2,026 miles of coastline on its mainland alone, risks becoming a poster child for the effects of rising sea levels.\n“The United States used to play a really useful role in influencing the Vietnamese to make good clean-energy decisions,” Osius told HuffPost this month in one of his first interviews since quitting in protest over a new White House policy to deport Vietnamese refugees.\n“Apparently the United States government no longer focuses on policy decision-making that’s influenced by sound science,” he added. “That makes it harder to make the case to other countries that they ought to make decisions based on sound science.”\nNearly a year after President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords, Vietnam has effectively become a canary in the coal mine for how closely other nations will stick to the global agreement’s goals as the U.S. abandons them.\xa0\nVietnam is under pressure, attempting to balance rapidly increasing energy demands with growing concerns over climate change ― and it’s finding a generous coal-friendly patron in China.\nThe Southeast Asian country began rapidly building up its coal-fired power capacity in 2011 as it transformed itself into a manufacturing hub and outgrew its hydropower resources. Back in its first major national plan for energy development, the country had aimed to increase its coal power generation by 75,000 megawatts by 2030.\nDuring the final years of the Obama administration, however, the U.S. urged Vietnam to pursue renewable energy and cleaner-burning natural gas instead. Vietnam enthusiastically signed onto the Paris Agreement in April 2016 and since then has received roughly $40.5 million in aid from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Green Climate Fund.\nIn response, Vietnam reduced the planned construction of new coal-fired infrastructure by 20,000 megawatts and increased renewable energy projects by 14,000 megawatts. The country already operates more than 20 coal plants with a total capacity of 13,000 megawatts, accounting for one-third of the national power mix, according to a March report from Vietnam Investment Review.\nThe U.S. wasn’t the only clean-energy influence. The government faced internal pressure to shift away from coal. Last month, Khanh Ngụy Thị, founder of the Vietnamese nonprofit Green Innovation and Development Centre, won the 2018 Goldman Environmental Prize, the so-called “green Oscar,” for her work convincing state agencies to increase use of renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\nHoang Dinh Nam / Pool / Reuters\n\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump poses with Vietnamese\xa0President Trần Đại Quang during a welcoming ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi on Nov. 12, 2017.\n\n\n\nBut even after scaling back its plans, Vietnam was still set to triple the number of coal plants by 2030, increasing capacity to more than 55,000 megawatts. Coal power would comprise 42.6 percent of electrical production.\nNow, energy and environment experts worry that the country’s next national power development plan, which is being written this year, could hold to those figures or, worse, embrace a more aggressive coal strategy.\nThe Trump administration has offered some positive language to those pushing for clean energy. In a joint statement issued with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc last May, the White House “affirmed its assistance to Vietnam in combating climate change via concrete mitigation and adaptation measures.” The administration repeated a similar line in November, after a meeting with Vietnamese President Trần Đại Quang. The U.S. Agency for International Development is continuing to fund projects in the Mekong and Red River deltas.\nBut perhaps more significantly, the White House has proposed slashing the USAID budget by 33 percent.\n“Apparently there have been some fluctuations in funding from one year to the next,” a USAID spokesman said in an email, noting that the delta projects have continued so far. He did not respond to questions about the funding for those individual programs, and they were not itemized on the State Department’s\xa0budget justification\xa0in February.\nPresident Trump has pushed to scale back regulations on coal in the U.S. and made pitching the fuel a top priority at the annual United Nations climate conference.\xa0In one of his first moves as president,\xa0he pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multi-nation trade deal that, despite\xa0drawing criticism\xa0from environmental groups, was expected to\xa0drive down the costs\xa0of renewable energy in developing countries.\xa0Last June, he announced plans to withdraw from the Paris accord\xa0and curtailed all U.S. payments to the Green Climate Fund. This year, he named a new secretary of state: Mike Pompeo, a vigorous climate change denier who, as a congressman, made repeated attempts to cripple funding for renewable energy projects.\nIn short, the Trump administration seems unlikely to apply any real pressure on other countries to pursue clean energy or combat climate change.\n“When we stopped leading on climate change, that made it a heck of a lot easier for people to proceed with business-as-usual policies,” Osius said.\nFor Vietnam, that means modeling itself on China, the world’s biggest source of climate-altering pollution. Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party transformed the country into one of the continent’s fastest-growing economies by following in China’s footsteps, becoming a magnet for textile, chemical and electronics manufacturing as its giant neighbor increased wages and environmental regulations.\n\nWhen we stopped leading on climate change, that made it a heck of a lot easier for people to proceed with business-as-usual policies.\nTed Osius, former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam\n\nMechanisms like the Green Climate Fund were meant to help countries such as Vietnam leapfrog the most pollution-prone stage of economic development by building up wind, solar and energy efficient infrastructure instead of coal-fired power plants ― something China did not do.\n“We are supposed to be the big counterweight to China,” said Virginia B. Foote, chief executive of Bay Global Strategies, an energy-focused government relations consultancy based in Hanoi. Now Vietnam is “just going to listen to the big bully to the north, and there’s no counter-bully to listen to at all.”\nVietnam’s energy needs are growing. The country’s industrial south suffers frequent power outages, relying on a grid so fragile that a crane operator’s accident plunged 22 of 63 provinces into darkness for 10 hours in May 2013. Vietnam’s state-owned utility, EVN, began burning more diesel\xa0to meet the country’s energy needs last year and said it would likely increase use of the fuel from 2018 to 2019.\nDespite this, the Vietnamese enjoy low energy costs, particularly in the north, where most of the country’s coal mining takes place. The average price of electricity comes to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour ― far below even that in Louisiana, the cheapest state in the U.S., where residents pay nearly 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the latest Energy Information Administration figures.\n“Politically, it’s understandable,” Foote said. “Everybody loves having cheap power, though it leads to waste and lack of incorporating clean technology.”\nThe prices in Vietnam fail to factor in the steep societal costs of increased coal burning. A 2015 Harvard University study found that 4,300 Vietnamese die prematurely each year as a result of coal pollution ― a figure that could increase to as much as 25,000 per year under a more aggressive coal buildup.\n\n\n\n\nAlexander C. Kaufman / HuffPost\n\n\nIn the crowded streets of smoggy Hanoi, a train passes very, very close by people’s homes.\n\n\n\nThe state-owned utility operates as a nationwide monopoly, forcing proposals on electricity development to navigate a labyrinthine bureaucracy.\xa0The current low rates make any tweaks to the existing model a difficult sell. The template that EVN released last year for power purchase agreements on renewable energy was panned by investors as “unbankable,”\xa0meaning it posed too much risk to private companies.\n“[F]ew reputable financiers would be likely to sign up,” Giles Cooper, co-general director of the Ho Chi Minh City-based law office Duane Morris Vietnam, wrote in a blog post in October, concluding that the “final text does little to inspire confidence.”\nOfficials at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nVietnam has, however, found a steady stream of suitors to finance its coal infrastructure. As of last December, foreign investors funded new Vietnamese coal projects to the tune of more than $16 billion. Of that, Chinese investments, funneled through that country’s biggest state-owned commercial banks, made up 50 percent, followed by Japan’s 23 percent and South Korea’s 18 percent. Vnesheconombank, a Russian financial entity, is backing the controversial Long Phu 1 power plant under construction in Soc Trang Province.\nIn February, PetroVietnam, the state-owned Vietnamese company building the Long Phu 1 plant, withdrew its application for U.S. financial support, ending what was widely seen as the first major test\xa0of whether the Trump administration would use the Export-Import Bank of the United States to support a project that exacerbated climate change.\nHanoi enjoyed just 38 days of clean air last year as air pollution surged to levels four times higher than those deemed acceptable under World Health Association guidelines, according to a January report from the Green Innovation and Development Centre. That makes Hanoi’s pollution worse than that of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and puts it close to notoriously smog-choked Beijing.\n“Now, when it comes to climate, our government’s head is in the sand,” Osius said. “That means countries are going to have to fend for themselves a lot more.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Savior Of Iraq’s Garden Of Eden Says He Knows How To Stop The Next Big War\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Shatters Records With $306 Billion In Damages From Climate-Linked Disasters\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change Is Already A Public Health Crisis, Top Medical Journal Says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Senate Advances Court Pick Who Said Planned Parenthood ‘Kills Over 150,000 Females A Year’',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― The Senate judiciary committee voted Thursday to advance U.S. District Court nominee Wendy Vitter, a vocal opponent of abortion rights who initially didn’t tell senators about her past extreme comments on the topic.\nEvery Republican on the committee voted for Vitter, a New Orleans lawyer and President Donald Trump’s choice for a lifetime seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Those GOPers were Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).\nEvery Democrat voted against Vitter.\nDuring her April confirmation hearing, Vitter, 57, repeatedly avoided saying whether she still agrees with a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans.\n“Planned Parenthood says they promote women’s health,” she said at the time, per New Orleans’ Clarion Herald. “It is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women’s health is to let them live.”\nMany of Trump’s court picks have records of being anti-abortion. Vitter, who is general counsel of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is married to former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), has been pretty upfront about her background, too.\nBut her refusal to say whether she stands by her past comments didn’t sit well with Democrats on the committee. It didn’t help that she\xa0failed to disclose that speech to the panel, along with other speeches she’s given.\nVitter also didn’t tell senators that she\xa0moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference\xa0peddling false information about the dangers of abortion ― or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms saying that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News uncovered these missing materials in March.\nOmitting details like this is a big no-no to senators on the committee, who expect a thorough submission of background materials for judicial nominees. It also at least creates the appearance of Vitter not wanting the panel to know about some of her controversial comments.\n“All I’m looking for are judges that are fair and impartial,” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said in Thursday’s hearing. “They need to exhibit judgment, not to mention common sense. Ms. Vitter’s public endorsement of these obvious falsehoods... and her urging of the audience to distribute materials containing such obvious lies shows she lacks the judgment for a lifetime appointment.”\nVitter has also taken heat for not saying if she agreed with the landmark civil rights case that desegregated U.S. public schools, Brown v. Board of Education.\nHer nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been confirming Trump’s judges at a breakneck pace\xa0and has vowed to confirm every court nominee this year who makes it out of the judiciary committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'The Koch Network Is Going After One Of Trump’s Favorite Congressmen',
  'body': '\nA Koch brothers-backed nonprofit is targeting one of President Donald Trump’s favorite members of Congress as part of a new ad buy slamming House members who supported a $1.3 trillion spending package earlier this year.\nThe six-figure effort from Americans for Prosperity is set to begin over Memorial Day weekend and includes direct mail, digital, radio and\xa0print ads aimed at 10 Republicans and seven Democrats.\nAmong the GOP members is Pennsylvania’s Rep. Lou Barletta,\xa0the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in November. Barletta became famous for leading a crackdown on illegal immigration while mayor of Hazleton more than a decade ago and was personally encouraged by Trump to run for the Senate.\xa0\n“It’s time to take a hard look at what lawmakers say and what they actually do when it comes to reining in overspending,” said Americans for Prosperity spokesman Bill Riggs. “The $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress in March showed a complete disregard for fiscal responsibility. Both parties are responsible for putting the country on an unsustainable fiscal path, which is why AFP is committed to holding both parties accountable.”\nThe expansive spending package narrowly passed the House and survived a brief veto threat from the president. The goal of the new campaign is to ensure that the next spending deal includes significant cuts to government spending.\xa0\nThe Koch brothers’ expansive political network spent heavily to help the GOP win and retain control of the Senate in 2014 and 2016, and it’s highly unusual for them to attack a GOP Senate candidate in a swing state, even if most handicappers consider Barletta an underdog in November.\xa0\nFormer Koch network operatives are also\xa0ubiquitous throughout the Trump administration\xa0and the group pushed aggressively for the GOP’s tax reform plan. But the network’s leaders have become more open about their frustrations that the president and his party aren’t following the network’s libertarian-influenced policy preferences on immigration, trade and government spending. Earlier this month, the group’s Hispanic outreach arm, LIBRE, sent out mailers thanking four Democratic lawmakers for their work to protect Dreamers.\xa0\n“We will be looking for allies wherever we can find them ― on the left, the right, or in the middle,” James Davis, the executive director of the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a CNN op-ed last month. “We welcome all comers. And we will hold those accountable who stand in the way of progress, regardless of their party.”\nThis isn’t to say that the network, which has spent billions to advance conservative policies and elect Republicans over the past decade, is suddenly turning bipartisan. While they’re attacking Republicans like Barletta and vulnerable Michigan Rep. Mike Bishop, for example, they’re also slamming Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who is challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz this fall, and hitting Florida Rep.\xa0Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.\nAnd they’re also spending money on ads and direct mail thanking a large group of vulnerable Republicans who voted against the spending package, including Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Jim Renacci, the GOP nominees for Senate in Tennessee and Ohio; and Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado and Rod Blum of Iowa, who are both top targets for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nOther members targeted by the campaign are GOP Reps. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, Mike Simpson of Idaho, John Carter of Texas, Robert Aderholt of Alabama, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, Tom Rooney of Florida and Ken Calvert of California, as well as Democratic Reps. Stephanie Murphy of Florida,\xa0Pete Visclosky of Indiana, Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania.\xa0\nThe ads are also thanking Republican Reps. Dave Brat and Tom Garrett of Virginia, Steve Pearce of New Mexico, Chris Stewart of Utah, Jason Lewis and Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, Andy Harris of Maryland and Ted Budd of North Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Kim Jong Un Still Committed To Meeting With Trump, South Korea Says',
  'body': '\n\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) -\xa0North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his commitment to “complete” denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and to a planned meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday.\nIn Washington, Trump signaled that preparations for the summit with Kim were going ahead.\nMoon and Kim agreed at a surprise meeting on Saturday that a possible North Korea-U.S. summit must be held successfully, Moon told a news conference in Seoul.\n“Chairman Kim and I have agreed that the June 12 summit should be held successfully, and that our quest for the Korean peninsula’s denuclearisation and a perpetual peace regime should not be halted,” Moon said.\nThe meeting was the latest dramatic turn in a week of diplomatic ups and downs surrounding the prospects for an unprecedented summit between the United States and North Korea, and the strongest sign yet that the two Korean leaders are trying to keep the on-again off-again meeting on track.\nA statement from North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said Kim expressed “his fixed will” on the possibility of meeting Trump as previously planned.\nMoon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in a bid to keep the high-stakes U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump’s “firm will” to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.\nWhile maintaining that Kim is committed to denuclearisation, Moon acknowledged Pyongyang and Washington may have differing expectations of what that means, and he urged both sides to hold working-level talks to resolve their differences.\nIn a letter to Kim on Thursday, Trump had said he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea’s “open hostility.”\nBut on Saturday, Trump said he was still looking at a June 12 date for a summit in Singapore, adding that talks were progressing very well.\n“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”\nA White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.\nThe Trump administration is demanding that North Korea completely and irreversibly shutter its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump’s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.\n“BETTER THAN A PHONE CALL”\nMoon said he held Saturday’s impromptu meeting, the second summit between the two sides in a month, at Kim’s request.\n“Chairman Kim requested a meeting without any formality two days ago and I gladly accepted it,” Moon said, noting that the summit was in line with previous agreements for the two leaders to meet more often.\n“A meeting was held because officials of both countries thought that meeting face-to-face would be better than a phone call,” Moon said.\nTheir talks at the Panmunjom border village, which South Korean officials said lasted two hours, came after their April 27 meeting, the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade that was also held at the same venue. At that meeting, they declared they would work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War.\nThe KCNA statement said Kim and Moon agreed to hold high-level talks between their two nations on June 1, and to take steps to quickly implement their efforts to denuclearize the peninsula. KCNA said the leaders also agreed to meet frequently.\nThe agency said the two leaders had reached a “satisfactory consensus” and expressed “their stand to make joint efforts for the decentralization of the Korean peninsula.”\nMoon said while Kim is committed to denuclearisation,\xa0North Korea is not convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.\n“However, during the U.S.-South Korea summit, President Trump clearly emphasized that we may see not only the end of hostile relations but also economic cooperation if North Korea denuclearises,” Moon said. “I urge North Korea and the U.S. to confirm each other’s will by sharing their problems with each other and communicating directly.”\nA senior South Korean official later said that the two Koreas are discussing a possible non-aggression pledge and the start of peace treaty talks as a way of addressing Pyongyang’s security concerns ahead of U.S.-North Korean negotiations.\nVideo and a photo released by South Korea’s presidential Blue House on Saturday showed Kim hugging Moon and kissing him on the cheek three times as he saw Moon off after their meeting at Tongilgak, the North’s building in the truce village, which lies in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - the 2.5-mile (4 km) wide buffer that runs along the heavily armed military border.\nMoon is the only South Korean leader to have met a North Korean leader twice, both times in the DMZ, which is a symbol of the unending hostilities between the nations after the Korean War ended in 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n(Additional reporting by Soyoung Kim, Choonsik Yoo and Jeongmin Kim in SEOUL; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Trump Team Moves To Lift Ban On ‘Extreme’ Hunting Tactics In Alaska',
  'body': '\nThe Trump administration on Monday proposed rolling back a 2015 rule that bans aggressive predator control tactics in national preserves in Alaska, including shooting bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens ― a move immediately blasted by environmental groups.\xa0\nThe\xa0proposal, slated to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, would amend the National Park Service’s current regulations to again allow for controversial sport hunting and trapping techniques on roughly 20 million acres of federal lands in Alaska. The park service, part of the Department of the Interior,\xa0said lifting the prohibitions would increase hunting opportunities on national preserve land,\xa0as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called for in a pair of secretarial\xa0orders last year.\xa0\nThe proposed rule would allow hunters to lure brown and black bears with bait, hunt black bears and their cubs using artificial lights,\xa0shoot bear cubs and wolf and coyote pups in their dens,\xa0and use dogs to hunt black bears. It would also allow hunters to shoot swimming caribou from motorboats.\xa0\n\nAllowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric and inhumane.\nJamie Rappaport Clark, Defenders of Wildlife president and CEO\n\nEnvironmental groups voiced disgust at the attempt to strip away protections.\xa0\n“I’m outraged that [President Donald] Trump and his trophy-hunting cronies are promoting the senseless slaughter of Alaska’s most iconic wildlife,” said Collette Adkins, a lawyer and biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Cruel and harmful hunting methods like killing bear cubs and their mothers near dens have no place on our national preserves.”\nDefenders of Wildlife said the 2015 park service rule prevented “extreme methods of killing predators.”\n“The Trump administration has somehow reached a new low in protecting wildlife,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, the nonprofit’s president and CEO. “Allowing the killing of bear cubs and wolf pups in their dens is barbaric and inhumane. The proposed regulations cast aside the very purpose of national parks to protect wildlife and wild places.”\nThe park service said in an emailed statement the proposed rule would “establish consistency” with state regulations.\xa0\n“The conservation of wildlife and habitat for future generations is a goal we share with Alaska,” agency regional director Bert Frost said.\nA 60-day public comment period begins Tuesday.\xa0\nThe proposal comes a little more than a year after Congress\xa0approved a measure to repeal an Obama-era rule that largely banned hunting of Alaska’s most iconic predators in Alaska’s national wildlife refuges. The Republican-sponsored legislation opened the door for the state to resume aggressive predator control tactics, including shooting bears and wolves from airplanes, on more than 76 million acres of refuge land.\xa0\nTrump signed that bill into law in April 2017.\nFor more information about the National Park Service’s proposal or to submit public comments, visit\xa0www.regulations.gov\xa0and search for “RIN 1024-AE38.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Edward Snowden: There’s No One Trump Loves More Than Vladimir Putin',
  'body': '\nIt’s clear Donald Trump is a huge fan of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But whistleblower\xa0Edward Snowden\xa0says Americans shouldn’t get their hopes up that special counsel Robert Mueller is going to nail the U.S. president for colluding with the Kremlin.\n“There’s no one in this world that [Trump] loves more than the Russian president,” said Snowden, who exposed eavesdropping by the National Security Agency five years ago and now lives in exile in Russia, a fugitive from U.S.\xa0espionage charges.\n“I think people are asking for too much when they hope that the Mueller investigation is going to come up with a smoking gun against Trump ― yes, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump in the hotel room with the piss tape,” Snowden quipped in Friday’s episode of the “Deconstructed” podcast at The Intercept. “That’s not how the world works. Life is not that simple.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nSnowden, speaking from Moscow, said he also doesn’t believe Trump is the kind of crack double operator Putin would rely on.\n“To be honest, everyone who has heard Trump speak for three minutes knows he’s a wrecking ball,” he said. “This does not sound like the kind of person that you would want to engage in some kind of complicated ‘Manchurian Candidate’” spy operation, when “the guy can’t even remember what he’s going to say at the end of a sentence.”\n“That doesn’t mean that he didn’t want to cooperate,” Snowden added. “That doesn’t mean he wouldn’t do anything to achieve an advantage.”\nSnowden encouraged people — including would-be leakers in the U.S. government — to continue to struggle for change.\n“I believe that this world can be better. I believe that this world should be better. But it’s not going to get better unless we make it better,” he said. “And that requires risk. That requires hard work. That ultimately might require sacrifice.”\n“Things change,” he went on. “If they can change for the worse, they can change for the better. If more good people are organizing... if we’re willing to draw lines that we will not allow people to cross without moving us out of the way, the pendulum will swing.”\nCheck out the entire podcast here.\nCORRECTION:\xa0A previous version of this story indicated Snowden faces treason charges in the U.S. In fact, he has been charged with espionage.\n',

 {'title': 'Rudy Giuliani Admits White House Is Trying To Discredit Russia Investigation',
  'body': '\nPresident\xa0Donald Trump’s lawyer flatly admitted that the White House is waging a fierce information campaign against special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nThe aim: to delegitimize the probe in the eyes of voters and lawmakers in Congress.\nRudy Giuliani,\xa0asked about the near-daily attacks on the probe, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, “They are giving us the material. I couldn’t do it if I didn’t have the material. ... It is for public opinion.”\n“Because eventually, the decision here is going to be: impeach, [or] not impeach,” he continued.\xa0“Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be informed a lot by their constituents. So our jury ... is the American people. And the American people\xa0... Republicans largely, independents pretty substantially, and even Democrats now question the legitimacy of it.”\nTrump in recent days has ratcheted up his attacks against the Russia investigation, the Justice Department and the FBI. He has claimed that the FBI had “infiltrated” and “spied”\xa0on his 2016 presidential campaign when the agency reportedly used\xa0an informant to make contact with Trump campaign advisers who allegedly had suspicious contacts linked to Russia. He also demanded the Justice Department investigate the accusations and turn over any relevant documents to Congress.\nMeanwhile, Democrats who attended a classified briefing about the informant with top DOJ officials last week said they saw “no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign.” Top Republicans who also attended the briefing have remained silent, however.\nAsked Sunday by CNN’s Dana Bash whether he believed the Russia probe is legitimate, Giuliani said, “Not anymore.”\n“I did when I came in, but now I see Spygate,” Giuliani said, using Trump’s preferred term for describing revelations that an FBI informant made contact with two of his campaign advisers as part of the investigation into Russia’s meddling.\n“I know 50 years of investigatory experience tells me they don’t have a darn thing because they would’ve used it already and they wouldn’t be off on collusion, they wouldn’t be off on Manafort, they wouldn’t be off on Cohen,” Giuliani added.\nWatch the full clip below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Sarah Sanders: It ‘Bothers Me’ Being Called A Liar',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON ― White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says it bugs her when people accuse of her lying to the press.\n“It certainly bothers me,”\xa0she\xa0told The New York Times in a Wednesday article. “Because one of the few things you have are your integrity and reputation.”\nBut Sanders has told lots of lies, and it’s not hard to give examples. PolitiFact cites four times\xa0the White House press secretary gave objectively false information.\nShe said in a November briefing that diversity visa immigrants are not vetted (false). She said in an October briefing that Chicago, which has high rates of gun-related crimes, has the toughest gun laws in the country (pants on fire!). She claimed in July that President Donald Trump has “in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence” (false),\xa0despite\xa0videos showing otherwise. In March 2017 she\xa0said “multiple news outlets” reported that when he was president, Barack Obama ordered wiretapping of Trump (false).\nSome of the things Sanders has said are laughably untrue.\nShe insisted this month\xa0that the Trump administration is “committed to a free press” ― right after Trump hinted at\xa0stripping reporters of their credentials and claimed, once again, that mainstream news outlets critical of his presidency are “fake news.”\nIn May 2017,\xa0she claimed there was not “ever an attempt” to blame Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite a statement that week from then–press secretary Sean Spicer putting the blame squarely on Rosenstein.\n\n\n\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\n\nLook at all the reporters’ hands in the air.\xa0Why can’t they get factually correct answers?\n\n\n\nIn her defense, Sanders’ job sounds bananas. She has to provide accurate information given to her by a president who lies all the time. And in this White House, the level of chaos and turnover has been so high, it’s not hard to imagine that something that may be true in the morning is no longer true by that evening.\n“There’s a difference between misspeaking or not knowing something than maliciously lying,” Sanders said in the Times piece.\nBut part of her dishonesty is in her unwillingness to acknowledge when the president has said something that just isn’t true.\nWhen a reporter asked Sanders in October why Trump kept falsely saying that the U.S. is the highest-taxed nation in the world, she gave a hilariously nonsensical answer.\xa0In July, when Trump randomly criticized Rosenstein for being from Baltimore, even though he is from Philadelphia, Sanders couldn’t even admit that was wrong. She said Trump was making a “general statement.”\nReporters confronted Sanders earlier this month about why she falsely told them that Trump did not reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for $130,000 in hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels just before the November 2016 election.\n“You said, on March 7, ‘There was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he’s denied all of these allegations,’” CNN’s Jim Acosta said during the May 3 press briefing. “Were you lying to us at the time, or were you in the dark?”\xa0\nSanders said only that Trump still denies the allegations by Daniels.\n“I gave you the best information that I had, and I’m going to continue to do my best to do that every single day,” she said.\nAs Sanders does her best to be truthful, there’s one group she has no problem calling out as liars: all 16 women who say Trump sexually assaulted them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Saudi Arabia Told The World Its Problem Was Islam. It’s Actually Tyranny.',
  'body': '\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman doesn’t apologize for much. In the past year, his government has massacred civilians\xa0in Yemen, kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon and spent $450 million of unknown provenance on a painting while rounding up hundreds of people\xa0for alleged corruption. He’s publicly defended those actions. \nBut there’s one thing the crown prince is always willing to express remorse about: Islam, or at least the version dominant in his country. “We were victims,” he recently told “60 Minutes.”\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s pitch to governments, citizens and, most importantly, investors, explicitly plays on global Islamophobia and many Muslims’ own frustrations about the violence committed in the name of their religion. It neatly identifies Islam as a problem and the prince as the solution. And this summer is supposed to bring a marquee moment for the battle against fundamentalist Islam\xa0the crown prince says he’s fighting: On June 24, women will gain the legal right to drive in Saudi Arabia.\nBut the “reformer” prince’s rhetoric is colliding with the reality of his rule. Since May 15, his government has been arresting human rights advocates\xa0— among them some of the most prominent Saudi women activists — in a crackdown that perpetuates\xa0long-standing Saudi repression.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed’s pitch to governments, citizens and, most importantly, investors, explicitly plays on global Islamophobia and many Muslims’ own frustrations about the violence committed in the name of their religion.\n\nThe crown prince’s playbook is an old one. For strongmen in the Muslim-majority world, the trope of the scary Muslim is invaluable. It allows them to bond with skeptics of Islam abroad — remember the orb? — and constantly justify their continued rule. \nAfter all, the argument goes, do you really want their people in charge instead? It’s the kind of language Syrian President Bashar Assad proudly uses to declare himself a vital defender of secularism and paint his opposition, including peaceful activists, as essentially too Muslim.\nTalk of “moderation” and “modernization” has defined regional rulers seeking to solidify their control since at least the early 20th century. But Muslim leaders became especially invested in that language after the 9/11 attacks prompted global soul-searching about the roots of terrorism, according to Annelle Sheline, a George Washington University doctoral student who studies the way governments in the region brand themselves.\nThese leaders watched with alarm as members of the George W. Bush administration argued that the key to peace was spreading democracy.\n“The Middle East regimes were not so interested in having the spotlight shined on their activities or sharing their power,” Sheline said. Eventually, “the Bush administration was fairly willing to buy into the bill of goods that a lot of Arab regimes were selling, which was that it’s not authoritarianism, it’s Islam, and we need to change Islam.”\nSo the regimes promised change. The Saudis pledged to cut hate speech from their textbooks. Jordan gathered 200 scholars\xa0for a declaration of Muslim tolerance and unity. Around the region, governments expanded their control over what was preached and discussed in mosques. Implicit throughout was the idea that they could identify and enshrine a “correct” Islam for subjects always on the verge of falling for fundamentalists, and that that was all the change the world needed to deal with al Qaeda and its affiliates.\nWhen the 2011 Arab Spring protests exposed how unhappy and marginalized many Muslims remained, the region’s authoritarians were in a bind. Some — like Assad, and Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi — set off nightmarish civil wars. Others tried to be more subtle, working to boost fears internationally about the figures gaining political power for the first time.\n“It was like, ‘Oh, good, if we let them have democracy, we have the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, or else we get war in Syria.’ There’s definitely been this sense that clearly these people aren’t ready for democracy,” Sheline said. She believes that argument is flawed because it doesn’t acknowledge how violent undemocratic regimes inspire more violence in their societies.\n\nAround the region, governments expanded their control over what was preached and discussed in mosques. Implicit throughout was the idea that they could identify and enshrine a “correct” Islam for subjects always on the verge of falling for fundamentalists.\n\nClaiming to take big steps toward moderation is especially difficult for the rulers of Saudi Arabia. Crown Prince Mohammed claims the kingdom has only espoused a strict interpretation of Islam since Iran began doing so in 1979. But the truth is that proponents of ultra-traditionalist theology have been allied with the royal family for over 200 years. \nUnderpinning that alliance is one goal: the survival of a regime in which the al Saud family and clerics close to them are all-powerful. As long as that remains the crown prince’s ultimate priority ― and he authorizes those working for him to punish even the slightest questioning of the system ― any moves away from state-sponsored orthodoxy won’t make his society more stable.\nAbroad, too, it’s unclear that the crown prince’s vows of change will help to reduce militancy. \nMuslim communities from Indonesia to Kosovo have claimed that Saudi influence is responsible for fundamentalism that never existed previously. Saudi proselytizing did become intense after Iran started challenging its regional dominance, and Crown Prince Mohammed has admitted as much.\xa0But Saudi government influence over preachers, books and centers abroad receiving Saudi funding actually started declining before 9/11 and the rise of the Islamic State. \nAnd it’s unclear that reining in the Saudi government’s religious intervention abroad or Saudi individuals’ influence in other countries will magically reshape Islam. Violence and alienation drove people in places like Tunisia and Pakistan to terror groups long before Saudi petrodollars started flowing into their societies;\xa0they will continue to do so long after. \nNone of that is to say the crown prince and his ilk should start advising Muslims to become less tolerant. “To the extent that anybody buys into [Western-backed governments’ ‘moderate’ narrative], that’s good.\xa0We’d rather have the government putting out messages around toleration and moderation,” Sheline said of the view among U.S. officials. \nBut the cracks within Saudi Arabia, a country of 20 million people and the center of the global trade in energy and weapons, are not going away. Clamping down on intellectuals, stoking nationalism against Iran and calling activists “traitors” won’t heal them. Nor will the flows of foreign capital that Crown Prince Mohammed has identified as his top target. \nReal change will require rethinking Saudi “practice” altogether — not just the religious kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

They also said their calculation is “likely to be conservative” and the final death toll may actually exceed 5,000.\xa0\nThe researchers began by surveying several thousand households across Puerto Rico to estimate the real mortality rates in the immediate post-hurricane period. They compared those rates to the official mortality rates during the same time period the previous year to determine how many additional deaths Hurricane Maria may have caused.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study said researchers had to develop the post-hurricane mortality statistics themselves because Puerto Rican officials did not release official numbers.\n\n\n\n\nRicardo Arduengo / AFP / Getty Images\n\n\nThis was the neighborhood of Juana Matos in Catano, Puerto Rico, one month after Hurricane Maria hit.\n\n\n\nRosselló\xa0told Cooper that he was “shocked” to hear this latter allegation and pointed to the executive order that he’d signed to release this information.\n“If it’s true, Anderson, there will be hell to pay, because I really want this to be very transparent,” said Rosselló. “I want the truth to come out. That’s the bottom line. And I want us to learn from this tragedy.”\nThe governor also said that his government hired George Washington University to conduct an assessment of the death toll, but those researchers have been delayed because\xa0“the best data was not available.” That report was initially due this spring.\n“We expected to have a phase-one analysis here by May 22, but, of course, data has been hard to come by with respect to that,” said Rosselló.\xa0\nThe 2018 hurricane season is officially underway and, eight months after Maria, many\xa0Puerto Ricans are still without power\xa0or reliable access to health care.\xa0\n',

 {'title': 'New Hampshire Dug Deep Into Allegations Of Widespread Voter Fraud. It Found Very Little.',
  'body': '\nNew Hampshire election officials dug into claims there was widespread voter fraud in the state during the 2016 presidential election and found no evidence to support his claim. \nIn fact, the officials didn’t find much evidence of fraud at all.\nDonald Trump lost in New Hampshire to Hillary Clinton by\xa02,732 votes, but he said he would have won had it not been for people bused into the state to illegally cast ballots. He has offered no evidence to support that claim. \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a presentation to the state’s Ballot Law Commission on Tuesday, election officials said that 6,033 of the 86,952 people who voted on Election Day did not present a photo ID and signed an affidavit that they were eligible to vote in New Hampshire, according to WMUR. Of those 6,033, the state secretary of state’s office verified that all except for 458 were legitimate voters, WMUR reported. The state attorney general investigated those 458 cases and verified they were eligible voters in all but 66 cases. \nThe data offer a significant rebuttal to one of Trump’s most specific allegations of voter fraud. Even though several studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem, Trump has repeatedly claimed that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election. He convened a federal commission in May to\xa0investigate the issue but disbanded it in January before it scrutinized much. One of the panel’s two public meetings was in New Hampshire in September, and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the body’s vice chairman,\xa0said he had evidence the U.S. Senate election there was swayed by illegal votes, but New Hampshire election officials\xa0refuted his claims.\nThere’s no evidence that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, but a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 56 percent of Republicans and 23 percent of Democrats surveyed said they believe it took place. \nAnne Edwards, a New Hampshire associate attorney general, told the Ballot Law Commission that her office received complaints of buses with out-of-state licenses plates showing up at the polls in 2014 and 2016, WMUR reported. When the attorney general’s office investigated,\xa0it determined that the buses were rented from out of state but were used to transport legitimate voters to the polls.\xa0She also said the attorney general’s office has investigated 28 complaints of wrongful voting and found just five to be “founded,” according to the Associated Press.\nBradford Cook, the chairman of the Ballot Law Commission, requested the presentation from state officials because of heightened concerned about election integrity. \n“What the president said isn’t true,”\xa0he said. “People making wild and irresponsible charges about the integrity of the basic step in democracy — just because they lose an election and can’t get it through their head that people might have voted for somebody else — is destructive.”\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D) used a system called Interstate Crosscheck, run by Kobach, to compare the state’s voter rolls with those of more than two dozen other states to identify possible double voters. The system identified 94,610 people registered in New Hampshire who had the same date of birth and first and last name as a registered voter in one of the other states. When investigators looked further, they found that all but 142 ― about 0.02 percent ― were legal voters in New Hampshire, AP reported. \nGardner’s sent 51 of those cases to the attorney general for review and is waiting for more information about the rest.\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R)\xa0is weighing whether to sign a measure that would change the residency requirements for people to vote in New Hampshire. Current law reads that people may vote in the state if they intend to remain there more than in any other place “for the indefinite future.” The bill would remove that phrase from eligibility criteria — excluding, for example, short-term residents and out-of-state college students.\xa0Critics of the proposed measure say it would amount to a poll tax because anyone who met the qualifications to register to vote in the state would also have to register a vehicle there, but the bill’s Republican supporters say the current law is inconsistent and the new one wouldn’t put up obstacles to registering. \nRay Buckley, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said the data from the presentation offered evidence that a change in the law was unnecessary.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\nTrump Again Falsely Insists He Would Have Won New Hampshire If Not For Voter Fraud\n\n\nAlmost Half Of Republicans Believe Millions Voted Illegally In The 2016 Election\n\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans Are Pushing Another Measure Restricting Who Can Vote\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Jack Johnson Was Pardoned, But Taboo Sex Is Still Being Criminalized',
  'body': '\nPresident Donald Trump posthumously pardoned Jack Johnson on Thursday, erasing the black boxer’s century-old conviction for violating the Mann Act — a 1910 law that prohibited transporting “any woman or girl” across state lines “for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose” — by driving his white girlfriend from Pittsburgh to Chicago.\nThe timing of Trump’s decision was remarkable. Two months ago, Trump signed into law the bipartisan Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which holds websites accountable for any sex-trafficking-related content posted by users. Its backers pitched it as a way to combat human trafficking. But like the Mann Act, FOSTA targets some of the people it ostensibly aims to protect: It has already shuttered many of the websites that voluntary sex workers — those who are not trafficked — used to screen clients and keep themselves safe. \nAlthough drafted and signed more than a century apart,\xa0both laws are part of the United States’ long history of citing human trafficking as a pretext to crack down on consensual but taboo sex.\nAll this has happened before\nThe Mann Act, also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act, was enacted in response to public hysteria about sensational yet unconfirmed reports of white women being kidnapped and trafficked by foreign men. \n“There’s a huge range of things that [the act] allowed the government to punish and control,” Alexandra Levy, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, told HuffPost. “It gave tremendous leverage to punish interracial marriage, polygamy and promiscuity.” \n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, thousands of people were prosecuted under the act. Johnson’s conviction\xa0in 1912 was a prime example of the broad power of a law pitched as a way to stop what was at the time called white slavery. His crime was, essentially, being black and driving across state lines with a white woman,\xa0even though she went voluntarily and was his girlfriend. \nSeven years after the Mann Act passed, federal officials instituted the American Plan to protect U.S.\xa0servicemen from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases before they took off to fight in World War I. The initiative allowed for the detention of women suspected of having a venereal disease. It was celebrated across the political spectrum for keeping American troops safe and for “curing” thousands of women of sexually transmitted infections ― though those “cures” often meant arsenic- and mercury-based medicines and involuntary sterilization. \nJust like the Mann Act, the plan took aim at some of the most vulnerable,\xa0like Nina McCall, a young poor white woman from Michigan who was arrested in 1918 under suspicion of being a prostitute. After her arrest, she was forcefully examined and medicated,\xa0then detained in a federal medical institution for three months. In Michigan alone, more than a thousand women\xa0were detained under the plan by 1918. \nThe Mann Act and the American Plan were swift responses to changes in American culture and the seemingly sudden rights and privileges granted women, said Scott W. Stern, who recently published\xa0a book about the McCall case. \n“In the early and late 1910s, women were getting the vote in various states, women were beginning to get formally educated, women were joining political parties, and premarital sex was skyrocketing, as was divorce,” he said. “Both the Mann Act and the American Plan were really about controlling women, and especially working-class and nonwhite women at a time when women were becoming ‘uncontrollable.’”\n“The Mann Act today is most famous because of the prosecutions of certain very prominent men, like Charlie Chaplin, Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson,” Stern continued. “Certainly those are notable cases, but what I think far too few people know is that the Mann Act was used to lock up huge amounts of women and police their lives.” \xa0\n\n\n\n\nAfro Newspaper / Gado / Getty Images\n\n\nJack Johnson in 1920 with his second wife, Lucille Cameron.\xa0He was often criticized for his romantic relationships with white women.\n\n\n\nThe first people arrested by officers of the Investigation Bureau — the Justice Department agency that would later become the FBI — for violating the Mann Act were a madam and five sex workers traveling together from Michigan to Chicago, Stern noted. \nSo while the Mann Act and the American Plan were ostensibly aimed at saving vulnerable women, in practice the initiatives allowed the Justice Department to control them, their sexuality, and the men they associated with ― many of whom were black or\xa0Chinese. \nA Pattern Repeated, Again and Again\nMeasures like the Mann Act and the American Plan set the stage for legislation like FOSTA. \nThe law aimed to curb human trafficking by holding websites and social platforms accountable for hosting content related to the sex trade. But much like the Mann Act and the American Plan, it polices members of already marginalized communities. \nThe new regulations pushed sites like Craigslist and Backpage to scrub their platforms of not only sex-trafficking-related content but sex-related content in general. That meant that not just sex traffickers\xa0but also voluntary sex workers and people who engage in online sexual activities were forced further underground. \nMelissa, a Phoenix-based escort, told HuffPost\xa0that FOSTA forced her back onto the streets. Lexi, a Florida-based escort, said she couldn’t screen her clients anymore without access to the sites. \nSex workers are often already members of marginalized communities, lacking easy access to banking and health care and safety from sexual or physical violence. \n“It’s an important parallel,” Levy said. \nThe Mann Act and FOSTA used similar tactics to pass with overwhelming majorities. The Mann Act was passed unanimously, Stern said. The House and Senate versions of FOSTA passed almost unanimously.\xa0\nThe Mann Act was written in response to accounts of enslavement of white women. Similarly, FOSTA used hysterical anti-trafficking rhetoric — often provided by evangelical Christian organizations that oppose all sex work — to garner support from the public.\n\n\n\n\nPool / Getty Images\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Act on April 11. Like the Mann Act a century earlier, the law is being used to target women.\n\n\n\n“The public is so easily manipulated when you say ‘trafficking,’” Levy said. “It’s a very emotionally provocative issue. You can sort of leverage that term.” In both cases, the public was galvanized by terrifying (and misleading) anecdotes of sex-trafficked children or white women, only for the legislation to be used against marginalized people after it was signed into law. \nTrump’s decision to pardon Johnson shows progress. But Johnson’s story also offers an important lesson, Levy argued.\n“It should call our attention to the fact that laws that purport to be anti-trafficking can mask very serious social agendas,” she said. “Hopefully we can learn from this.” \n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n\nTrump Pardons Late Boxing Champion Jack Johnson\n\n\n‘This Bill Is Killing Us’: 9 Sex Workers On Their Lives In The Wake Of FOSTA\n\n\nTrump Signs Controversial Bill Targeting Online Sex Trafficking\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Mike Pompeo Promises To ‘Crush’ Iran And Achieve A Better Deal',
  'body': '\nWASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday presented a lengthy list of grievances against the Iranian government and vowed to forge a new, better nuclear agreement — but he offered few details on how the United States would accomplish that goal without support from European allies, Russia or China.\n“The bet that the [2015 Iran nuclear deal] would increase Middle East stability was a bad one for America, for Europe, for the Middle East and indeed for the entire world,”\xa0Pompeo said during his first major speech in his new role, promising that the new deal would address not only the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program but also its ballistic missile program, its interventions in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, and its repressive treatment of its own people.\n“We will track down Iranian operatives and their Hezbollah proxies operating around the world and crush them,” Pompeo added, referring to the Lebanese armed group that is Iran’s chief ally in the region. “Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East.” \nThe original deal ― negotiated between Iran, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia ― focused only on Iran’s nuclear program, and some of its provisions would expire 10 to 15 years after it took effect. State Department officials had described Pompeo’s speech as an opportunity for the secretary to present a diplomatic roadmap to achieving a better deal with Iran two weeks after President Donald Trump announced plans to violate the\xa0international nuclear agreement by pulling out.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the secretary offered few clues about how Washington might convince Tehran to sign on to a tougher accord.\xa0Pompeo’s chief proposal ― fresh sanctions that would force the Iranians to negotiate ― depends on cooperation from Russia, China and Europe, which, unlike the U.S., do significant business with Iran. Obama administration officials spent years building a sanctions framework with those governments before attempting the nuclear diplomacy. \nPompeo repeatedly blasted President Barack Obama’s team as naive and even once suggested they actually sought to help the Iranian government. But it’s unclear how the Trump administration believes it will prove more successful than its predecessor in bringing aboard other international powers. Since Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the deal, the other countries involved in it have scrambled to ensure that Iran continues receiving economic benefits so that it will continue upholding its end of the deal, which they say is essential to global security.\n\nPompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran.\nSuzanne Maloney, a former State Department official at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe European Union has already started the process of insulating European countries from U.S. secondary sanctions, which punish companies in other countries for doing business with Iran. Russian aircraft manufacturers moved to sell planes to Iran after the Treasury Department announced it would cancel licenses that allowed Boeing and Airbus to sign deals with Iran. And China is eyeing opportunities to replace Total on a massive Iranian gas field expansion project if the French energy giant pulls out of the country under pressure from the U.S.\nThe Trump administration’s contradictory approach to Iran ― exemplified in Pompeo’s speech by his saying Tehran negotiated in bad faith and simultaneously arguing Trump wants to create a grand bargain with it ― has convinced partner governments they need to develop their own policies without looking for leadership from the U.S.\nThe EU, the closest American partner in diplomacy with Iran, has been unusually blunt in recent days. “Looking at latest decisions of @realDonaldTrump someone could even think: with friends like that who needs enemies,” Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council,\xa0tweeted last week.\nPompeo attempted to downplay the rift. “From my conversations with Europeans friends, I know that they broadly share these same views, of what the Iranian regime must do to gain acceptance in the international community,” he said.\xa0\nHours after Pompeo’s remarks, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal.\n“There is no alternative to the JCPOA,”\xa0Mogherini said in a statement, referring to the Iran deal’s official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\xa0“Secretary Pompeo’s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the JCPOA has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence Iran’s conduct in areas outside the scope of JCPOA.”\xa0\nPompeo\xa0 — like hawkish national security adviser\xa0John Bolton — has warned that the Trump administration would be willing to punish European businesses dealing with Iran.\nThe Europeans have already been burned by the U.S. Over the past several months, the State Department’s director of policy planning, Brian Hook, led negotiations with U.S. allies aimed at creating parallel agreements to supplement the 2015 nuclear accord, part of an effort to entice Trump to stay in the deal. State Department officials say they were close to reaching an agreement — but Trump seemed to have not even known about the effort.\nDuring his speech on Monday, Pompeo specifically referenced cooperating with the few American partner governments who praised Trump’s Iran deal decision: Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Some of them and other pro-U.S. nations like Qatar have supported the Trump administration’s anti-Iran actions since the announcement on the deal,\xa0including\xa0placing new sanctions on Iran-linked figures and entities.\nBut it’s unclear how far Gulf countries will go to pressure the Islamic Republic, particularly if Europe, Russia and China try to sustain significant international economic activity with Iran. The UAE and Qatar have their own strong economic ties to Iran, and officials around the region are wary of sparking fresh tensions between the few remaining stable governments there.\nPompeo tried to justify his case by repeatedly referencing the plight of ordinary people: Iranians themselves, Middle Easterners at risk from Iranian-backed Houthi and Hamas militants and Syrians suffering because of Iran’s support for the brutal Assad regime. (In Trump-era style, he both spoke of Syrians as victims and then repeated the misleading populist argument that Syrian refugees flowing into Europe include many terrorists.)\xa0\nYet so far, the effects of Trump’s decision are hitting the individuals Pompeo mentioned the hardest ― making it more difficult for Iranians\xa0to buy vital goods\xa0and for U.S. officials to use diplomacy\xa0to help the American prisoners held in Iran.\xa0\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran will likely only grow in the months ahead as hard-liners there gain power by pushing the narrative that the West cannot be trusted and the Trump administration continues to try and look tough.\nExperts who watched Pompeo’s speech called his demands unrealistic and some\xa0predicted\xa0that when Iran inevitably fails to meet them, the U.S. will use it as justification for military intervention.\n“Pompeo has not outlined a strategy, but rather a grab bag of wishful thinking that can only be interpreted as a call for regime change in Iran,” tweeted Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department official during the George W. Bush administration.\nThis article has been updated to include comment from Federica Mogherini.\n',

 {'title': 'The Supreme Court Just Made It A Lot Harder For You To Sue Your Employer',
  'body': '\nEmployers who stiff their workers or discriminate against them just got a big lift from the Supreme Court, which issued a major ruling Monday making it easier for companies to avoid employee lawsuits.\nThe 5-4 ruling upheld employers’ use of class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. By signing these controversial provisions, workers give up their right to band together and sue in court for back pay or damages, and are instead forced to\xa0take their disputes to arbitrators\xa0individually.\nArbitration agreements have become a common way for employers to stifle lawsuits that could lead to large plaintiff classes and big payouts. Workers backed by employee groups and labor unions challenged their employers’ use of these agreements, claiming they ran afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, which guarantees workers the right to join forces in “mutual aid and protection.”\nThe employer-friendly conservative majority on the court decided against the workers. They ruled that collective bargaining law does not supersede federal law that established the arbitration process, therefore making the class-action waivers in employment contracts legitimate.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying Congress did not write the NLRA to “displace” federal arbitration law.\n“The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,” Gorsuch wrote.\xa0\nThe high court has previously ruled that companies can force consumers into arbitration agreements with class-action waivers, which are tucked into the fine print when you buy a plane ticket or sign up for a cell phone. The latest ruling effectively sanctions the use of these waivers in the workplace, a practice that has grown increasingly common over the last two decades.\nThe Supreme Court ruling will have long-lasting implications for workers. Class-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws. \nIt’s harder to pursue these cases as a single worker than as part of a group, which is why employers prefer arbitration. Lawyers can be reluctant to file individual complaints in which the judgments or settlements will be small and not worth their time. Many workers are also hesitant to file their lawsuits as individuals, fearing their employers will ostracize or retaliate against them.\nIn a strong dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision of the majority “egregiously wrong.” She argued that the rights under the NLRA include the right to pursue litigation collectively, and that an employer-dictated waiver would violate it.\n“Employees’ rights to band together to meet their employers’ superior strength would be worth precious little if employers could condition employment on workers signing away those rights,” Ginsburg wrote.\nDuring oral arguments last year, Justice Stephen Breyer said the case could undermine “the entire heart of the New Deal” by weakening collective action by workers.\nAccording to a report last year from the Economic Policy Institute, an estimated 25 million workers ― just under one-quarter of non-union employees in the private sector ― give up their right to join class-action lawsuits as a condition of employment. The report anticipated that waivers would become an “even more widespread practice” in the event the Supreme Court sanctioned them.\n\nClass-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court case, National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., consolidated three separate cases involving different employers: the software company Epic Systems, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young, and the oil company and gas station chain Murphy Oil. \nA former Murphy Oil employee, Sheila Hobson, claimed that when she worked at one of the company’s retail stores, she and her colleagues were required to do off-the-clock work they weren’t compensated for. They got together to sue the company for back pay. But when they consulted a lawyer, they learned they couldn’t take Murphy Oil to court as a group because they had already agreed to arbitration when they accepted their jobs.\nThe National Labor Relations Board, the independent agency that enforces collective bargaining law, argued that the forced arbitration clause interfered with Hobson’s right to join together with other employees to improve their working conditions. The Obama White House agreed, filing a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Hobson.\nBut that was under former President Barack Obama. After President Donald Trump was inaugurated, his administration took the extremely rare step of reversing a previous administration’s position on a sitting case before the court. Last June, Trump’s acting solicitor general filed a new brief in support of the employers in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Solar Panel Tariff Will Cost Over $2.5 Billion In Projects And Thousands Of Jobs, Developers Say',
  'body': '\nJune 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters.\nThat’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports.\nThe tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices.\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters\n\n\nPresident Trump signed directives to impose tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January.\n\n\n\nTrump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors.\nSolar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal.\nThe U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables.\nGTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.\nOfficials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment.\nCompanies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations.\n“There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Nickelsberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\nLOST PROFITS, JOBS\nThe 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent.\nLeading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said.\nThat amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline.\nDeveloper Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy.\n“Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said.\nNeither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later.\nBoth are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests.\nOther companies are having similar problems.\nScott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff.\nPine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said.\nThe company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff.\n“It was just not feasible,” Hanes said.\n\n\n\n\npraethip via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSTOCKPILING PANELS\nFor some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nSouth Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said.\nOther developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.\nSome firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January.\nThe company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West.\nIntersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels.\nThe 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.\n‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’\nTrump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices.\nPanel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation.\nSunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many.\nBut SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs.\nJobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said.\nHeliene ― a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year ― said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota.\n“The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”\n\nRELATED...\n\n\nSolar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels\n\n\nSave American Solar\n\n\nIf Trump’s Proposed Border Wall Were Covered in Solar Panels, Could It Pay for Itself?\n\n\nInstead Of Trump’s Wall, Let’s Build A Border Of Solar Panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 {'title': 'Scott Pruitt Gives Nonsensical Explanation For Chick-Fil-A Controversy',
  'body': '\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator\xa0Scott Pruitt\xa0is defending an attempt he made last year to secure a “business opportunity” for his wife with fast-food chain Chick-fil-A.\nThe attempted deal came to light in government emails released on Tuesday by the Sierra Club, which obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request. When Nextstar TV reporter Jessica Smith asked him about the effort on Wednesday, he responded indirectly by saying there are “significant” and “needed” changes happening at his agency and across the administration.\n“With great change comes, I think, opposition,” Pruitt said. \xa0\nI asked Scott Pruitt a quick question about the reports he tried to help his wife become a Chick-fil-A franchisee.  “With great change comes, I think, opposition...I love, she loves [Chick-fil-A]” pic.twitter.com/gND2tdMq1e— Jessica Smith (@JessicaASmith8) June 6, 2018\n\n\nThe emails, as first reported by The Washington Post, revealed that Pruitt ordered an aide to set up a call with the chairman of Chick-fil-A in May 2017 to discuss, on behalf of Pruitt’s wife, Marlyn Pruitt, the possibility of becoming a franchisee of the fast-food chain.\nShe never completed the application, a Chick-fil-A spokeswoman said Tuesday. But Don Fox, who headed the federal Office of Government Ethics under President Barack Obama, told the Post\xa0that the call raised concerns about the “misuse of public office.”\nPruitt brushed off the report on Wednesday and signaled his and his wife’s enthusiasm for the fast-food chain.\n“I love, she loves, we love [Chick-fil-A],” he said. “Chick-fil-A is a franchise of faith, and it’s one of the best in the country. And so that’s something we were very excited about ... We need more of them across the country.”\n“It’s an exciting time,” he added.\nThe EPA did not immediately respond to requests for clarification whether a business deal between Marlyn Pruitt and Chick-fil-A was still a possibility.\nTuesday’s revelation is the latest in a string of controversies involving Scott Pruitt in recent weeks. Two top EPA employees ― aide Millan Hupp and senior counsel Sarah Greenwalt ― resigned on Wednesday,\xa0prompting further speculation that the agency is unraveling under its administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',
